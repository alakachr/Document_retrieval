  "query": "What novel compositions and methods effectively inhibit melanin production for skin lightening purposes?,",
  "negative": "The novelty of this investigation lies in the discovery that a distinct group of compounds known as 'substituted imines' demonstrates a remarkable ability to decelerate the synthesis of melanin. This study encompasses the development of skin care formulations, specifically targeting the reduction of melanin to lighten the skin. These formulations incorporate substituted imines that share a resemblance to Structure Z. Additionally, this exploration delineates methodologies for employing such formulations in skin care routines, with a particular emphasis on facial and underarm regions, aiming primarily at the attenuation of skin pigmentation. The substituted imines are characterized by Structure Z, where R5 and R6 are independently selected from groups that include cyclohexyl, phenyl, and naphthyl, while variables b and c range from 2 to 4. Moreover, R7 and R8 are independently chosen from groups such as methyl and ethyl, potentially forming piperazino or morpholino rings. An improved decrement in melanin synthesis is noted when 'b' equals 2, and R5 and R6 are selected from cyclohexyl, phenyl, substituting the phenyl rings with groups like C1-C5 alkyl or halogens. The findings postulate that the amounts of these substituted imines may vary from 0.001% to 15% by the weight of the skin care composition.\n",
  "pos": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to compositions for face and body skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The desire to look young and healthy is universal. The primary attributes of the young and healthy-looking skin are evenness of the skin color and texture. Age spots and other skin hyperpigmentation are undesirable. In many parts of the world, consumers also want to lighten their background skin color. Accordingly, there is a need for commercially feasible, effective skin care compositions, especially skin lightening products. Various compositions comprising some substituted diamines or related structures have been described, for example in EP 2193779 (Cognis); WO 2005/016895 (KIM); WO 2008/009860 (L&#39;Oreal); Hirota et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,943; EP 0653208 (Pfizer, Inc.); Dowell et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,393,519; Winchell et al., US 2001/0041170; Chassot et al., US 2003/0172471; DE 20110356 (Wella AG); Walton, US 2005/0220832; Wagner et al., US 2009/0010860; WO 2008/101692 (Beiersdorf AG); WO 2008/129188 (L&#39;Oreal); EP 0922 447 (Beiersdorf AG). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based at least in part on the finding that among hundreds of compounds described as \u201csubstituted diamines,\u201d a sub-group (Structure I below) with critical structural elements, is effective at inhibiting melanin production. The invention includes skin care compositions, preferably skin lightening compositions, comprising substituted diamines of Structure I. The invention also includes methods of using such compositions for skin care, especially face and underarms, most especially for skin lightening. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Except in the examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word \u201cabout.\u201d All amounts are by weight of the final composition, unless otherwise specified. It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration or amount, any particular upper concentration can be associated with any particular lower concentration or amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the word \u201ccomprising\u201d is intended to mean \u201cincluding\u201d but not necessarily \u201cconsisting of\u201d or \u201ccomposed of.\u201d In other words, the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive. The disclosure of the invention as found herein is to be considered to cover all embodiments as found in the claims as being multiply dependent upon each other irrespective of the fact that claims may be found without multiple dependency or redundancy. \u201cSkin Care Composition\u201d as used herein, is meant to include a composition for topical application to skin of mammals, especially humans. Such a composition may be generally classified as leave-on or rinse off, and includes any product applied to a human body for improving appearance, cleansing, odor control or general aesthetics. The composition of the present invention can be in the form of a liquid, lotion, cream, foam, scrub, gel, soap bar or toner, or applied with an implement or via a face mask, pad or patch. Non-limiting examples of skin care compositions include leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, toilet bars, antiperspirants, deodorants, dental products, shave creams, depilatories, lipsticks, foundations, mascara, sunless tanners and sunscreen lotions. \u201cSkin\u201d as used herein is meant to include skin on the face and body (e.g., neck, chest, back, arms, underarms, hands, legs, buttocks and scalp). The inventive compositions are especially useful for application to skin areas with the highest incidence of hyperpigmentation\u2014face and underarms, most preferably the inventive compositions are skin lightening compositions, deodorants and anti-perspirants. \u201cLightening\u201d as used herein, means the lightening of skin color as well as the lightening of spots (hyperpigmentation) on the skin, like age spots and freckles. Substituted Diamines The inventive compositions include substituted diamines of Structure I: wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl, phenyl, naphthyl, ortho-, meta- or para-substituted phenyl with the following substituents: C 1 -C 5 alkyl, C 1 -C 5 alkoxy, halogens (F, Cl, Br), trifluoromethyl; a is 2 or 3; and R 3 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, fused to form pyrrolidino, piperidino or morpholino group.

It will be understood that Structure I encompasses amine salts (e.g., halogen salts, tosylates, mesylates, carboxylates, and hydroxides). Amounts of the substituted diamines may range from 0.001% to 20%, preferably from 0.01 to 10%, more preferably from 0.1 to about 10%, optimally from 0.1 to about 5% by weight of the composition. Process of Making Substituted Diamines Reagents &amp; Analytical Methods All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, EMD Chemicals) and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Parallel reactions and parallel solvent removal were performed using a Buchi Syncore reactor (Buchi Corporation, New Castle, Del.). Reaction monitoring was performed using either thin layer chromatography (TLC) or gas chromatography (GC). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 F 254 plates (EMD Chemicals) and visualizing by UV (254 nm), 4% phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) in ethanol (EtOH), 4% ninhydrin in ethanol and/or using an iodine chamber. GC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II Plus Gas Chromatograph equipped with a HP-1 crosslinked methyl silicone gum (25 m\u00d70.2 mm\u00d70.33 mm film thickness) column operated by GC Chemstation (HP, version A.06.01 [403], Hewlett Packard) software and the following parameters and gradient applied; injector temp 250\u00b0 C., oven temp: 70\u00b0 C. (2 min), ramp at 25\u00b0 C./min up to 250\u00b0 C., held at 250\u00b0 C. (11 min). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters 2695 Separations Module equipped with a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector and operated with Empower Pro software (Waters Corp.). Separations were carried out at 1 ml/min on a Restek Pinnacle DB C18 column (5 um, 4.6\u00d7150 mm) maintained at 30\u00b0 C. Samples for HPLC were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of sample in 1 ml mobile phase A:B (1:1) and injecting 5 \u03bcL onto the column. The mobile phase consisted of A=0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and B=0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (ACN) operated using gradient elution from 95:5 A:B to 5:95 A:B (gradient, 25 min) followed by 100% B (isocratic, 5 min). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using a Finnigan Mat LCQ Mass Spectrometer via direct infusion of samples (50 ppm) in methanol and the total ion count monitored using electrospray ionization in the (+) mode (ESI+). 1 H and 13 C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed using a Eft-60 NMR Spectrometer (Anasazi instruments, Inc.) and processed using WinNuts software (Acorn NMR, Inc.). Melting points were determined using a Meltemp apparatus (Laboratory Devices). Purity was determined by HPLC-UV/Vis or GC.

Specifically, the invention demonstrates that medications inhibiting lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract can prevent the development of lipidous urinary stones. Such pharmaceuticals operate by reducing lipid secretions in the urine while enhancing urine flow and the renal release of intrinsic substances such as salts and phospholipids. In parallel, these innate molecules aid in preventing lipid crystallization and subsequent stone formulation in the urinary tract.

  "pos": "GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND 1. Aim of the Invention This invention discloses the use of compounds of the azetidinone family in the prevention or treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease of the biliary tree in mammals. This invention is in the general area of lithiasic disease by cholesterol stones in the biliary tree. In particular, the invention evidences that the use of drugs that specifically block cholesterol intestinal absorption inhibit the onset of cholesterol gallstone disease in the biliary tree. These drugs act by decreasing biliary cholesterol secretion, and at the same time increasing the biliary flow and the hepatic secretion of endogenous compounds (e.g. bile salts, phospholipids) into the bile. In turn, these endogenous compounds contribute to inhibiting cholesterol precipitation and the formation of gallstones in the biliary tree. 2. Background of the Invention Cholesterol gallstone disease in the biliary tree, specifically in the gallbladder (cholelithiasis), is a highly prevalent illness in the adult population of developed western countries (10 to 15% of the population over 18 years of age). This disease reaches epidemic levels in the Hispanic and Native American populations of most countries in the Andean area, including Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Mexico, among others (Carey and Paigen, 2002; Everhart et al., 2002). In Chile, for example, we have demonstrated that the general occurrence in males is of 17% and in women of 30%, reaching incidences of over 50% in the population over 50 years of age (Miquel et al., 1998a). It has recently been estimated that in the United States, approximately 20 million people had been affected or are currently affected by this disease (Everhart et al., 1999). In countries like Chile, there are more than 2 million habitants affected by cholelithiasis. This epidemiological scenario makes lithiasic disease of the biliary tree the digestive pathology with the highest social cost in countries like the United States, with a annual estimated cost of 8-10 billion dollars, in direct and indirect expenses, which amounts to 1.3-1.5% of the total health care costs (Everhart, 1994). On the other hand, in developing countries such as Chile, cholelithiasisis the first cause of surgical hospitalizations, only surpassed by obstetric hospitalizations, with a high social cost for all the country&#39;s health care services (Csendes et al., 1993; Medina, Pascual and Medina, 1983). Biliary secretion has important physiological functions in our body; among other functions there is the elimination of steroidal molecules by secreting cholesterol and bile salts (catabolic cholesterol products). In fact, the biliary secretion is the main way of eliminating steroidal molecules from the body, having therefore, a central role in cholesterol homeostasis. The pathogenic mechanisms of cholesterol gallstone disease are only partially known. It is accepted as a dogma that the first metabolic defect necessary for the formation of gallstones is the generation of cholesterol rich bile, known as \u201ccholesterol over-saturated bile\u201d, by the liver. The generation of cholesterol over-saturated bile is then a defect in the physiological functions of hepatic lipid metabolism (Carey, 1993; Miquel et al., 1998b). The main metabolic defect in people that develop cholesterol gallstones is the selective increment of cholesterol secretion into the bile, in relation with the molecules that can solubilize cholesterol in the bile (bile salts and phospholipids). Therefore, a thermodynamically unstable bile solution is generated where cholesterol tends to move from a soluble to an insoluble phase, with precipitation of cholesterol crystals and cholesterol gallstone growth, mainly in the gallbladder where local conditions favor stasis and the retention of cholesterol crystals (Apstein and Carey, 1996). It is assumed that there are genetic factors as well as environmental factors involved in the generation of this chronic metabolic disease. However, these factors have yet to be elucidated (Paigen, 2002). We need to emphasize that bile cholesterol is mainly preformed cholesterol derived from plasma lipoproteins and not originated from hepatic neo-synthesis. Nevertheless, it is not clear the participation of cholesterol from the diet (intestinal) and/or cholesterol derived from peripheral tissue to the liver (reverse transport of endogenous cholesterol) in the generation of over-saturated bile and finally of cholesterol gallstones (Paigen, 2002). Once the gallstones are formed in the gallbladder they are clearly visible by imaging exams such as abdominal sonograms. The gallstones can remain in the gallbladder (or common bile duct) without causing symptoms during the person&#39;s whole life (silent gallstones), evolve to simple symptomatic forms (biliary colic type pain), or generate clinical complications with more serious prognosis like acute cholecystitis, vesicular empyema, suppurative cholangitis or acute pancreatitis, among others (Jonston and Kaplan, 1993). At the same time, cholelithiasis is the main risk factor for developing gallbladder cancer, a digestive neoplasia with bad prognosis and elevated prevalence in populations with high incidence of gallstone disease, like those present in Chile, Peru, Mexico, and the Native American and Hispanic populations of North America (Nervi, 2001). The main risk factors associated with a higher frequency of cholelithiasis in the different populations studied are: female gender, Amerindian genetic background, cholelithiasis in first degree relatives, pregnancy, obesity or overweight in women, abrupt weight loss in the morbidly obese, bariatric surgery in the morbidly obese, diabetes mellitus, puerperium, prolonged fasting, total parenteral nutrition, hypertriglyceridemia (Amigo et al., 1999; Paigen, 2002; Wudel et al., 2002). The animal models only develop cholelithiasis on the presence of a rich cholesterol diet (approximately 100-1,000 times that of the western human diet). Recently, some genetically manipulated animal models have demonstrated the critical role of the expression of genes relevant in intestinal cholesterol absorption (ACAT-2) and in transport of dietary cholesterol to the liver in the form of chylomicrons (Apolipoprotein E), in the generation of experimental cholelithiasis. The liver is a central organ in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. It is the main organ involved in the synthesis and catabolism of plasma lipoproteins, and the only organ able to eliminate significant quantities of cholesterol (and other steroidal molecules) from the organism, either as free cholesterol (approximately 1 gr/day) (Grundy, 1983) or via its conversion or catabolism into bile salts (Dietschy, Turly and Spady, 1993). Defects in hepatic cholesterol metabolism cause two highly prevalent diseases, atherosclerosis and cholelithiasis. The hepatic cells have complex molecular mechanisms that finally regulate the homeostasis of intracellular cholesterol. Experimental evidence in humans and animals allowed to estimate that the cholesterol destined to biliary secretion is mainly (85-95%) preformed cholesterol generated by the uptake of plasma lipoproteins, and only 5-15% is generated by hepatic biosynthesis (Vlahcevic, 1994). Studies performed in lithiasic patients and controls show contradictory results related to the hepatic cholesterol neo-synthesis activity and bile salts neo-synthesis (review in Apstein and Carey, 1996; Carey, 1993). However, it is accepted that in lithiasic patients, the cholesterol destined to biliary secretion in abnormally high levels is preferentially originated from a preformed pool of lipoproteic origin. The influx of lipoprotein cholesterol towards the liver can come from two sources: a) by reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver in HDL and/or LDL (Fielding and Fielding, 1995) and b) cholesterol of exogenous origin (dietary) that is transported from the intestine to the liver fundamentally as remnants of chylomicrons (rQM) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Wilson and Rudel, 1994). It is important to mention that cholesterol adsorbed at the intestinal level can be of exogenous origin (from the diet) or endogenous (biliary cholesterol). In fact, there is evidence showing that cholesterol present in the bile and secreted into the intestine is qualitatively more relevant (1000 mg/day) that cholesterol present in the western diet (200-400 mg/day). At the same time, cholesterol present in the bile appears to be absorbed more efficiently than dietary cholesterol. Other evidence suggest that in humans, dietary or intestinal cholesterol could be very relevant in the generation of lithogenic bile in people genetically predisposed to develop this disease. Most of the cholesterol deposited in gallstones seems to have a dietary origin (Holzbach, 1984). In addition, other evidence support the idea that cholesterol of intestinal origin is preferentially destined to biliary secretion facilitating the formation of lithogenic bile (Cooper, 1991). For example, a cholesterol enriched diet in gallstone carriers significantly increases the biliary cholesterol content in the subsequent weeks (Kern, 1994). There is only one repot that has compared the effect of dietary cholesterol in gallstone women and controls, demonstrating that only gallstone patients increase the biliary cholesterol secretion when exposed to an exogenous overcharge of dietary cholesterol (Kern, 1994). This data suggests that dietary cholesterol that can be destined to biliary secretion is probably regulated by yet unidentified genes, and their regulatory mechanisms appear to be altered in patients that develop gallstone disease. In contrast to the almost complete intestinal absorption of the majority of other nutrients, cholesterol absorption is limited to an average of 40-60% of the ingested cholesterol, with great variability among different species (Jolley, Dietschy and Turley, 1999) and amid people (Gylling and Miettinen, 2002b). The variability in cholesterol absorption capacity among individuals can be as high as 4-6 times (in a range of 30-80%) for a similar amount of dietary cholesterol. This finding contrast with the intra-individual variations observed at different times under the same dose of dietary cholesterol (&lt;6%) (Bosner et al., 1993). Similar variations in dietary cholesterol absorption ability can be observed in animal models, especially among different mice strains (Jolley et al., 1999). In the last few years, this variability in the capacity to adsorb dietary cholesterol has attained great relevance, not only from the viewpoint of studying the physiology of cholesterol metabolism, but also from the perspective of designing more effective therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis (Gylling and Miettinen, 2002a). During the last years, it has been possible to unravel, at least partially, the molecular mechanisms that control and regulate cholesterol intestinal absorption (Klett and Patel, 2004). The development of compounds that interfere with cholesterol absorption has gain great relevance during the last years with the aim of developing strategies for the treatment of hypercholesterolemias and atherosclerosis. The compounds that have been evaluated can be classified in three categories depending on their site of action: A) Those that interfere with intestinal absorption at the intra-luminal level, such as resins like cholestyramine, and natural and synthetic saponines, B) drugs that interfere with the entry of cholesterol into the enterocyte, such as type 2-azetidinones (Ezetimibe) and C) drugs that interfere with the esterification of cholesterol incorporated into the enterocyte, specifically inhibiting the enzyme ACAT-2. Only the compounds mentioned in point A and the 2-azetidinones are currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of dyslipidemias and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. EZETIMIBE (SCH 58235, ((\u2212)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-(3R)-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-(.S)-hydroxypropyl]-(4S)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-azetidinone)) is the first drug in a group of hypocholesterolemic medicines, the specific inhibitors of cholesterol absorption (Klett and Patel, 2004), derived from the structural class of the 2-azetidinones. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2002, under the registered brand Ezetrol\u00ae-MSD-Schering-Plough; and Zetia\u00ae, Merck/Schering Plough, North Wales, Pa. Ezetimibe (SCH 58235) corresponds to the second generation of specific inhibitors of cholesterol intestinal absorption, and was generated by structural modification and metabolites of SCH 48461 and SCH 53695 (SCH 53695 is the C-4 phenol of SCH 48461). Ezetimibe is a metabolite derived from the active forms of SCH 48461, with an inhibitory activity in cholesterol absorption 400 times higher than its predecessor analog (SCH 48461). This increase in the inhibitory activity of cholesterol absorption has been attributed to the incorporation of phenolic rings into SCH 48461 (Jeu and Cheng, 2003). Ezetimibe has demonstrated to effectively inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption in mammalian models (murine models) in dosages that fluctuate between 0.1-6 mg/kg body weight per day. Ezetimibe is indicated to be used as monotherapy or as combined therapy with inhibitors of the HMG-CoA-reductase (statins) in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemias for the reduction of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and ApoB. It is also indicated as combined therapy in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and as monotherapy in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia (Cheng and Leiter, 2003; Davidson, 2003; Iglesias and Diez, 2003; Lipka, 2003). The combined therapy with 2-azetidinones associated to inhibitors of the HMG-CoA-reductase (statins) such as pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, is based in the selective inhibition of cholesterol intestinal absorption. Because of this, a reduction in the hepatic cholesterol content triggers a compensatory associated effect in humans, increasing the neo-synthesis of cholesterol at the hepatic level. Therefore, when the 2-azetidinones are associated with a selective inhibitor (statins) of the critical enzyme (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the cholesterol neo-synthesis pathway, the reduction in the plasma cholesterol is enhanced. The combined therapy with 2-azetidinones plus inhibitors of the HMG-CoA-reductase in the pathology concerned in this invention (cholelithiasis) has not been evaluated and there are no communications about it in the scientific and medical literature. The specific mechanism of Ezetimibe action as a selective inhibitor of cholesterol absorption is still not known in detail. It is hypothesized that it acts by inhibiting the entry of cholesterol from the lumen into the enterocyte, acting at the apical plasma membrane level and interacting with some proteins involved in cholesterol trafficking (Klett and Patel, 2004). Ezetimibe is incorporated into the enterocyte, is glucuronized into its active metabolite at this level, and enters the entero-hepatic circuit of lipids (Jeu and Cheng, 2003). Even though Ezetimibe is up taken with high affinity by the liver, and is actively secreted toward the biliary tree reaching elevated concentrations in the bile, it is not known if this drug has other additional functions in the transport of steroidal molecules (e.g. cholesterol) at the hepatic and biliary tree levels. It is universally accepted today that the only effective therapy for the treatment of gallstone disease is the surgical resection of the gallbladder with its gallstones (cholecystectomy) (Gui et al., 1998). However, some pharmacological alternatives for treatment (non-surgical) have been developed. These treatments demonstrated effectiveness in the dissolution of gallstones in specific subgroups of patients with cholelithiasis (Hillebrant et al., 2002; Stiehl et al., 1984) and in some specific groups of patients at high risk for developing gallstone disease (Mason and Renquist, 2002; Wudel et al., 2002). The medical alternative is the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones by bile salts, chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid (Sugata, 1993). The most utilized internationally has been ursodeoxycholic acid because it shows lower rates of adverse effects and similar efficacy. These drugs act by increasing the bile salts contents in the bile and decreasing hepatic cholesterol secretion, thus generating bile that is not supersaturated with cholesterol and allowing the solubilization of cholesterol gallstones. It was demonstrated to be an affective therapy in patients with small cholesterol gallstones. However, it requires long therapy periods (6-12 months) and it is associated with high recurrence levels (50% in 5 years) when discontinued (Bilhartz, 1998; Stiehl et al, 1984). The association of ursodeoxycholic acid with statins (inhibitors of cholesterol neo-synthesis) has also been explored to this same end, but the efficacy of the therapy has not been demonstrated (Hillebrant et al., 2002; Miettinen et al., 1998). The possible utility of other hypolipaemiant drugs in the treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease has been evaluated without any clinical demonstrated effect. The use of fibrates, niacin or resins that decrease cholesterol and bile salts intestinal absorption (cholestyramine, probocol), has demonstrated no therapeutic effectiveness in cholesterol gallstone disease patients. Moreover, the use of hypolipaemiant therapies (that decrease plasma cholesterol) with fibrates (specifically clofibrates) in humans shows a clear increase in the risk of developing cholelithiasis (Amigo et al., 1999; Apstein and Carey, 1996). On the other hand, the use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) has shown contradictory results in pre-clinical and clinical models. In some experimental models and in some but not all human studies, this therapy reduces the biliary cholesterol content and the lithogenicity index; however it has not been demonstrated to be useful in the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones in prospective clinical studies (Chapman et al., 1998; Hillebrant et el., 2002; Porsch-Ozcurumez et al., 2001). The main problem is that nowadays there is no form for efficient primary prevention of gallstone disease in the general population or in specific high-risk groups (women, third trimester of pregnancy, puerperium, overweight or obese women, programmed weight loss in the morbidly obese, gastroplasty and intestinal by-pass in the morbidly obese, prolonged fasting, prolonged enteral nutritional therapy); nor there are effective medical therapies (e.g. dissolution of already formed gallstones). It is known that the 2-azetidinones and their respective pharmacological families are used in the treatment of elevated plasma cholesterol and are protected by diverse patents. For example, the documents U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,365, WO 2004 010948, WO 2004 081002, WO 2004 000803, WO 2004 000804, WO 2004 000805, divulge the use of Ezetimibe for the treatment of cholesterol disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, or cholesterol induced tumors. Even though cholelithiasis is a disease of cholesterol metabolism, there is not a clear correlation between total cholesterol plasma levels, LDL cholesterol plasma levels or atherosclerosis with the presence of cholesterol gallstones or with a higher risk of developing cholelithiasis. Consequently, the different therapies developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemias, main risk factors of atherosclerotic cardiovascular illness, have not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of cholesterol gallstone disease. Only hypertriglyceridemia and low plasma levels of HDL cholesterol have been associated in some studies with a higher risk of gallstone disease, without demonstrating a causal relationship between these serological variables and the development of cholelithiasis (Paigen, 2002). Because of the arguments presented above is that the present invention will solve a problem with the technique, since it is not an obvious inference that the current techniques developed for the treatment of plasma dyslipidemias and/or atherosclerosis are effective in the treatment of gallstone disease. A 2-azetidinone compound in combination with other drugs and its use in the treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease or cholelithiasis is mentioned in the documents WO2004001002 and WO20030153541. These documents specifically proclaim a pharmaceutical composite that includes a moderator of a LXR receptor and an agent of lipidic regulation such as Ezetimibe. The orphan nuclear receptor LXR acts a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and trafficking."

  "pos": "[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. parent application Ser. No. 11/445,282, filed Jun. 2, 2006, and claims foreign priority benefits from Canadian Patent Application 2,259,858 filed Dec. 1, 2005. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a child safety device, and more particularly relates to a device for tethering a child to an adult. BACKGROUND [0003] The use of a tether between a parent and child is known to prevent children from wandering too far from a parent and accordingly prevent the child from being lost. [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,772 to Kaufmann et al discloses an example of a tether for being coupled between a child and adult. A first belt is secured about the child and supports a reel thereon upon which a tether is wound. A first toy surrounds and disguises the reel. At an opposing end of the tether, a second belt is provided for securement about the waist of the adult. A second toy is coupled to the belt for covering the second end of the tether. This device however is particularly uncomfortable for the child which must carry the large bulky weight of the reel about their waist. Furthermore the attachment to the adult is similarly large and bulky so as to act as an obstruction to normal walking motion. The waist belt is poorly disguised because the toy used for decoration is coupled between the tether and the belt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a child safety device for tethering a child to an adult, the device comprising: [0006] an attachment mechanism for securement about a torso of the child; [0007] a first decorative body secured to the attachment mechanism for disguising the attachment mechanism; [0008] an anchor for being carried by the adult; [0009] a tether having a first end coupled to the attachment mechanism and a second end connected to the anchor; and [0010] a second decorative body attached to the anchor for disguising the anchor; [0011] the second decorative body being arranged for being selectively supported on the first decorative body; and [0012] the anchor being selectively storable within a hollow interior of the second decorative body. [0013] According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a child safety device for tethering a child to an adult, the device comprising: [0014] a tether extending between first and second ends; [0015] an attachment mechanism mounted on the first end of the tether; [0016] the attachment mechanism being arranged for securement about a torso of the child; [0017] a first decorative body arranged to surround and conceal the attachment mechanism; [0018] an anchor mounted on the second end of the tether; [0019] the anchor being arranged for securement by the adult; [0020] a second decorative body arranged to surround and conceal the anchor; [0021] the tether being operable between an extended position and a retracted position; [0022] the anchor and the attachment mechanism being spaced apart from one another in the extended position of the tether; [0023] the second decorative body being supported on the first decorative body such that the tether is concealed between the first decorative body and the second decorative body in the retracted position of the tether. [0024] When not in use, the function of the child safety device can readily be disguised by storing the second decorative body on the first decorative body and in turn storing the anchor within the second decorative body.

[0036] When the reel is biased in a winding direction for winding the tether onto the reel, preferably there is provided a lock mechanism which selectively restricts rotation of the reel in the winding direction. [0037] A release button for selectively releasing the lock mechanism is preferably located adjacent a rear side of the first decorative body, opposite the harness. [0038] Preferably, the first decorative body is plural times larger than the second decorative body for disguising the reel. [0039] According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a child safety device for tethering a child to an adult, the device comprising: [0040] a tether extending between first and second ends; [0041] an attachment mechanism mounted on the first end of the tether; [0042] the attachment mechanism being arranged for securement about a torso of the child; [0043] a first decorative body arranged to surround and conceal the attachment mechanism; [0044] an anchor mounted on the second end of the tether; [0045] the anchor being arranged for securement by the adult; [0046] a second decorative body arranged to surround and conceal the anchor; [0047] the tether being operable between an extended position and a retracted position; [0048] the anchor and the attachment mechanism being spaced apart from one another in the extended position of the tether; and [0049] a fastening mechanism arranged to support the second decorative body on the first decorative body in the retracted position of the tether.

[0067] In the drawings like characters of reference indicate corresponding parts in the different figures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0068] Referring to the accompanying figures there is illustrated a child safety device generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The device 10 is particularly suited for tethering a child to an adult, for example a parent or guardian. [0069] The device 10 includes an attachment mechanism 12 in the form of harness for securement about a torso of the child. The harness includes two shoulder straps 14 which are adjustable in length for being snugly secured about the shoulders of the child similarly to a conventional backpack and a chest strap 15 for joining the shoulder straps across a chest of the child. A waist strap 13 is also provided for securement about the waist of the child. The harness carries a storage chamber 16 on the back of the child to which the shoulder straps 14 are attached. [0070] A reel 18 is supported within the chamber 16 and supports a tether 20 thereon. The tether is anchored at its first end on the reel of the attachment mechanism so that the tether may be wound onto the reel from an extended position in which a second end 22 of the tether is spaced apart from the reel and the tether is at least partly unwound from the reel as shown in FIG. 3 , and a retracted position in which the second end of the tether is adjacent the reel and the tether is substantially fully wound on the reel as shown in FIG. 2. The reel is configured to be biased in a winding direction for winding the tether onto the reel into the retracted position. An automatic lock mechanism 21 selectively restricts rotation of the reel in the winding direction to retract the tether until a release button 23 is depressed for selectively releasing the automatic lock. [0071] The second end 22 of the tether 18 is coupled to an anchor 24. The anchor 24 comprises a loop of flexible material, for example elastic, but which has a fixed prescribed diameter in an unstretched position thereof. The loop is suitably sized for being supported about a wrist of the adult in use and accordingly has a preferred internal diameter of 3 to 4 inches. [0072] A first decorative body 26 (or first decorative item) is supported on the harness of the attachment mechanism for disguising both the harness and more particularly for disguising the reel supported within the storage chamber 16 thereof. The first decorative body 26 generally comprises a plush toy which is suitable stuffed with resilient material to provided a soft and aesthetically pleasing toy for the child to play with when the harness is removed from a child. [0073] A second decorative body 28 (or second decorative item) is supported on the second end 22 of the tether 18 and serves to couple the anchor 24 to the tether. The first decorative body 26 is plural times larger then the second decorative body which is intended to be blended into the first decorative body when supported thereon. The second decorative body 28 includes an internal storage area 27 defined by a hollow interior of the body and which is accessible through an opening having a closure member 29 for selectively closing the opening. The anchor 24 is connected to the tether internally within the internal storage area 27 so that the anchor 24 can be stored in the area and enclosed therein by the closure member 29 as desired. [0074] The first and second decorative bodies have a matching theme but differ in particular design. The second body 28 in particular is much smaller but remains compatible with the design of the first body. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 , the second decorative body comprises a dog bone which is received within the mouth of a dog forming the first decorative body so that second decorative body is blended into and disguised on the surface of the first decorative body in the retracted position of the tether. In the example of FIGS. 4 and 5 , the first body comprises a bumble bee for being disguised in a perching position on a flower forming the first decorative body. [0075] As shown in further examples, in FIGS. 6 and 7 , the second decorative body comprises a fly which is retracted into the mouth of a frog comprising the first decorative body. In this instance, the tether may also be disguised as a frog&#39;s tongue. As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 , the second decorative body may comprise a smaller version of the first decorative body to resemble a similar parent and child combination, but representative of animals or insects instead. As shown in a further example in FIGS. 10 and 11 , the first and second decorative bodies may instead comprise two types of animals which are known to be in a similar children&#39;s tale, for example the turtle and the hare. [0076] In use, the harness of the attachment mechanism 12 is secured about the torso of the child by extending the shoulder straps 14 over the shoulders of the child and tightening the straps in a manner similar to a conventional backpack. The first decorative body and the reel received therein are supported on the back of the child with the tether initially wound onto the reel in a retracted position. In the retracted position, a portion of the second decorative body is received within a mating recess 30 of the first decorative body so that the tether is fully covered by the first decorative body in the retracted position. The second decorative is thus disguised within the first decorative body by blending onto the surface thereof due to the compatible nature of the disguises of the first and second decorative bodies. Storing the anchor 24 within the internal storage area of the second decorative body further disguises the device when not in use. [0077] When it is desired to tether the child to the adult, the adult simply pulls the second decorative body away from the first decorative body and the anchor 24 is removed from the internal storage area of the second decorative body. The adult grasps the second end of the tether or the second decorative body to remain tethered to the child. If desired the adult may position their wrist through the loop forming the anchor for added securement to the child. The release button 23 is located adjacent a rear side of the first decorative body, opposite the harness so as to be out the reach of the child. [0078] Turning now to FIGS. 12 and 13 , a further embodiment of the child safety device 10 is illustrated. In this embodiment, the device is arranged similar to previous embodiments in that there is provided a tether 20 extending between first and second ends in which an attachment mechanism 12 is mounted on the first end of the tether and an anchor 24 is mounted on a second end of the tether. The attachment mechanism is again arranged for securement about a torso of the child while the anchor comprises a loop arranged for securement by the adult, about the wrist for example. Also similar to the previous embodiments, a first decorative body 26 is provided for surrounding and concealing the attachment mechanism 12 while a second decorative body 28 is provided which is arranged to surround and conceal the anchor 24. The attachment mechanism 12 again comprises a storage compartment 16 housing a reel 18 therein upon which the tether is wound in a retracted position. The tether communicates through a tether opening 40 in the second body similar to previous embodiments for communication between the reel 18 within the storage chamber 16 and the anchor which is separate from the first decorative body 26. [0079] The storage chamber 16 houses the reel in a lower portion thereof, while an upper portion of the chamber 16 is provided for storage of various accessories and the like. A first opening 42 is provided in the first decorative body 26 to provide access to the interior of the storage chamber 16 for storage of items therein. The first opening 42 is fully independent of the tether opening receiving the tether therethrough. A first closure member 44 in the form of mating hook and loop fasteners for example is provided on the first decorative body for selectively enclosing the first opening 42. [0080] Similar to the first embodiment, the second decorative body 28 includes a hollow interior 46 within which the anchor 24 is secured to the second end of the tether. A second opening 48 is provided on the second decorative body for access to the hollow interior for accessing the anchor 24 which is arranged to be received through the second opening in use."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention generally relates to a field of cases or kits for housing and carrying a plurality of individual cosmetic containers. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved compact case, which can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck, wherein removable inserts, each containing a predetermined shade and/or type of cosmetic, can be securely held in place thereby providing the user with a variety of cosmetic materials from which to choose. 2. Description of the Related Art Cosmetic materials available to the consumers in the market place are very numerous. The particular cosmetic assortment which an individual consumer purchases is entirely dependent upon that consumer&#39;s subjective preferences. A typical consumer of cosmetics normally desires an assortment of cosmetics which includes the desired colors, tints and hues to satisfy the consumer&#39;s preferences, in particular to fit and complement that consumer&#39;s facial characteristics, skin and hair color and condition, and even clothes. Additionally, various types of cosmetics may be desirable, for example, shadows, mascara, foundations, lipstick, powder, blush, lip gloss and so on. A typical packaging of cosmetics supplies traditionally comprised pre-selected, fixed containers of cosmetic materials having a variety of both colors and types. However, individual users&#39; tastes and needs vary widely, as noted above. Consequently, the cosmetics materials which do not suit a particular user&#39;s needs or taste would be inevitably wasted. This, of course, is costly to the consumer since the unused and wasted cosmetics are purchased together with desired cosmetics. It is, therefore, highly desirable to ameliorate such squander, to alleviate the prodigal practices and to ensure that consumers will have at their disposal a complete array of only desired cosmetics. To accomplish this advantageous result, there is need to provide a cosmetic compact case wherein a matrix configuration is provided to accept a plurality of individual removable cosmetic inserts so as to establish a cosmetic palette. There is, therefore, a need that the individual cosmetic inserts can be offered to the consumer independent of the compact case into which they will be positioned. Should such device be provided, consumers will be able to choose only those preferred cosmetics which are desirable for purchase and assemble them in a compact case so as to establish a personal and unique arrangement of cosmetics. In order to securely hold the inserts in their predetermined matrix position, it is very beneficial to use the inserts made of magnetic materials. Furthermore, it is desired that the case also include a centrally positioned divider, which can be a mirror. The divider would separate a powder section of the case from the section containing other supplies, such as eye shadows, lip color concealers, etc. Such design is especially desired by professional users of cosmetics, like professional actors and actresses, entertainers, musicians, and the like. Moreover, it is further beneficial to have a cosmetics case which can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck, so as to be immediately available. A belt attached to the case, for example, a VELCRO\u2122 belt or a belt having hook and loop fasteners, can be used for this purpose. U.S. Pat. No. 1,808,961 to Lyhne describes a compact and puff holder for vanity boxes. The Lyhne device has two sections each capable of holding containers with cosmetic supplies. The two sections are separated by a mirror serving also as a divider between the two sections. Yet, the Lyhne device comprises no Velcro fastener, and it cannot be worn around the user&#39;s neck or wrist, but only in a handbag. Furthermore, the Lyhne device does not have magnetically held inserts. Instead, the trays in Lyhne are held in place by mechanical means, which is less efficient and less reliable than the magnetic holders. U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,127 to Geer also describes a cosmetic case having interchangeable cosmetic inserts. This device also comprises a divider. However, the divider in the Geer device does not really separate different kinds of cosmetics. In Geer, they all are on one side and the purpose the lid serves is not to separate the inserts on either side of the lid, but rather to hold them in place and to prevent them from shifting. Geer uses no magnets to accomplish this goal. U.S. Pat. No. 2,264,300 to Davies describes a case having two halves. The first half is designed to hold cleansing disks, wafers and the like which have to be kept moist. The second half is for holding cosmetic supplies. The two halves are separated by a mirror which also serves as a divider. However, in Davies, just as in Geer, all the cosmetic are located on the same side and no magnets to hold the cosmetic inserts in place are used. Davies does not even teaches that those inserts are replaceable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,420 to Sussman describes a make-up kit having replaceable inserts. Each kind of cosmetic is held in a separate module, the contents of each are replaced upon exhaustion. However, this patent does not disclose any kind of a divider in the middle. Furthermore, Sussman does not disclose any magnets for holding the cosmetic modules in place. U.S. Pat. No. 5,005,697 to Jimbo, et. al. describes a make-up case containing a number of cosmetic pans. The bottom of each pan is provided with a magnet and the pans are held in place magnetically. However, there is no divider of any kind described in this patent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,012 to Kamen, et. al. describes a compact case and is somewhat alike the above-mentioned Jimbo patent. Kamen also uses magnets to hold cosmetic containers in place. In addition, the magnets are used to seal a joint between the lid and the base of the compact case. However, like in Jimbo, this patent describes no divider. U.S. Pat. No. 3,006,350 to Grunfeld describes a vanity case. It is designed to be worn around a person&#39;s wrist thus simultaneously being a bracelet as well. However, Gr\u00fcnfeld does not teach using a divider inside the case. Nor is there any use of magnets to hold the cosmetic in place. U.S. Pat. No. 5,655,553 to Giese, et. al. describes a cosmetic compact with cosmetic pans which can be removed, and with a mirror. The pans are held in place mechanically and are removed by applying pressure using mechanical means. This patent does not describe any magnetic devices for retaining the pans in place nor does it have a divider. U.S. Pat. No. 2,601,158 to MacGillivary describes a combination of a wrist watch and a vanity case. The relevancy of this patent lies in the fact that this device can be worn around a woman&#39;s wrist. However, the make-up portion of the MacGillivary device has no magnetized receptacles and no divider in the middle and no provisions are described for replacing the contents of the cosmetic bins. U.S. Pat. No. 1,788,399 to McAtree describes a vanity case having a centrally positioned mirror serving as a separator between two parts of the case. However, McAtree describes no various replaceable receptacles for different kinds of cosmetic nor any magnetic means for keeping the cosmetic in place. U.S. Pat. No. 1,777,027 to D&#39;Arlet describes a vanity case worn on a woman&#39;s wrist. D&#39;Arlet describes a case with compartments for a few kinds of cosmetic accessories. However, this device has no divider and does not provide for replaceable trays holding cosmetic and held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,774,171 to Coons describes another vanity case having a circular shape. This case comprises two similar circular portions, one serving as the cover and another\u2014as the body of the case. Each carries powder compact. There is a mirror, but it is attached directly to one of the portions and is not in the middle of the device separating the portions. There are no compartments for other kinds of cosmetic, no central divider of any kind, no provisions for wearing the device and no magnetic devices for securing the cosmetic. U.S. Pat. No. 1,607,985 to Johnson is similar to the above-described D&#39;Arlet patent, and likewise describes a vanity case worn on a woman&#39;s wrist. Johnson describes a case with only two compartments for cosmetics. The case has a mirror on the lid. However, like in D&#39;Arlet, this device has no divider and does not show replaceable containers holding cosmetic and held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,601,892 to Thralls describes a vanity case having two portions\u2014one for cosmetic supplies and the other\u2014for carrying, for example, business cards or paper money bills. The two portions are separated by a mirror-divider. The presence of this mirror is a feature making the Thralls invention relevant. However, this divider is not used to separate different kinds of cosmetics supplies. Rather, it separates cosmetic supplies from non-cosmetic items such as cards or bills. Moreover, the Thralls invention does not describe features allowing to use replaceable trays for various cosmetic held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,515,812 to Lindon describes a powder puff in a shape of oval. It comprises a lipstick holder. However, Lindon has no centrally located divider and no multiple receptacle for various cosmetic. The Lindon device is designed just for carrying powder and lipstick. U.S. Pat. No. 2,017,722 to Magnus describes a combination of a cigarette case and a vanity case. It shows a device with two compartments, an upper compartment and a lower compartment. The lower compartment serves to hold powder, while the upper compartment contains cigarettes. This device is somewhat relevant because, when the case is open, a mirror separates the two compartments. However, the mirror separates cosmetic (powder) and non-cosmetic (cigarettes) items, similar to the device described in the above-mentioned patent to Thralls. And finally, there are no replaceable cosmetic bins or magnet-based elements to hold them in place. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,130 to Sweder describes a make-up kit mounted on a steering wheel of a vehicle using VELCRO\u2122 or hook and loop fasteners. The Sweder patent only describes a way the kit is mounted on the steering wheel. It does not disclose any features describing how the kit itself is built. Therefore, the review of prior art reveals that no known invention describes a make-up case having the following features: 1) a divider, which divider is preferably, but not necessarily, a mirror; 2) a belt securely attached to the case so that the case can either be worn by the user on her wrist or around her ankle or as a pendant on her neck. In order to allow for wearing the case in such manner, the terminal portions of the belt comprise a velcro material; 3) magnets for holding cosmetic supplies in the case. Yet a need to have a device comprising all these features is acute. The device of the present invention, unlike all prior related art, shows all these features and satisfies all the needs discussed above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a make-up case or kit comprising two sections. The first section includes a plurality of replaceable and interchangeable inserts-holders containing cosmetics supplies, such as eye shadows, lip color concealer, mascara, foundations, lipstick, blush, lip gloss, and the like (except powder). In the first section, a brush holder is also provided to keep a shadow brush, or a lip brush, or a combination brush, one side of which is a shadow brush and the other side\u2014a lip brush. The inserts are made of a magnetic material and are attached to the bottom of the case magnetically. The second section comprises a compartment for holding pressed (compact) powder. This compartment is also removable and can be replaced when the powder is used up. The second section is separated from the first section by a divider. The divider preferably, but not necessarily, comprises a mirror. The bottom of the make-up case of this invention includes two slots in which a belt is secured. The belt is made of an elastic material and comprises VELCRO\u2122, or hook and loop fastener portions, allowing the user to wear the case around his or her wrist or neck. The gist of this invention is that the device described comprises three important features: the magnetic replaceable compartments for cosmetics, a central divider, and a belt so that the case can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck thus maximizing the convenience of the use. No previously known device has all these three features. Therefore, the device of this invention is novel over prior art and is non-obvious in view of it. According to a first aspect of the invention, a case for carrying and storing cosmetics supplies is provided, the case comprising two hingedly connected compartments, a flat dividing element inserted between the compartments which is hingedly held in place, and a plurality of magnetic holders of said cosmetics supplies removably insertable inside the first compartment, wherein the case is opened and closed by rotating either of the compartments about the hinge and the dividing element is rotatable about the hinge to cover either of the compartments. According to another aspect of this invention, the case further includes a belt secured to a bottom of either of the compartments, the belt allowing one to wear the case around a user&#39;s wrist or neck, and in order to facilitate wcaring of the case in such manner, the belt includes VELCRO\u2122, or hook and loop fastener sections.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 illustrate a square embodiment of the make-up case of this invention in an open position. In this embodiment the case 100 is generally rectangular in shape, and preferably, a square. It comprises two compartments 1 and 2 , connected with a hinge 3 , so as to allow a reciprocal movement therebetween. The compartment 1 is designed to hold inserts 4 preferably containing eye shadows, lip color concealer, mascara and other cosmetic supplies, except powder. Compartment 1 further comprises a brush holder section 5 designed to hold any kind of brush used in applying cosmetics. For example, section 5 can be split in two parts: one for an eye shadow brush and another for a lip brush, and a clip can be provided in the middle of section 5 (not shown) to hold the brush or brushes. The combination of the supplies, as well as the choice of particular brushes can be made according to particular tastes and needs of the user. Those skilled in the art will choose a proper combination of inserts and brushes. Compartment 2 comprises a tray 6 designed to hold compact powder. Any kind of powder ordinarily used can be placed in tray 6. Those skilled in the art will select proper powder which best suits their particular needs. Compartments 1 and 2 are separated by a divider 7 , connected to the make-up case by using the same hinge 3. At least one side of the divider 7 is preferably a reflective surface and either side of the divider can serve as a mirror. When the kit 100 is opened, compartments 1 and 2 are moved relatively to each other around the hinge 3 , until they are positioned in the same plane, as shown on FIG. 1. In such position, the divider 7 lies flat against the top surface of either compartment 1 (when the powder from compartment 2 is used) or compartment 2 (when the supplies from compartment 1 are used), as the case may be. When the user applies the supplies from either compartment, she uses one surface of the divider 7 as a mirror. When the user has completed using the supplies from a compartment, she rotates the divider 7 on the hinge 3 , covering this compartment and opening the other compartment (previously covered by the divider 7 ), followed by using the cosmetics from the other compartment. The other surface of the divider 7 can again be used as a mirror. Compartments 1 and 2 can be made of any size as selected. However, the sizes of compartments 1 and 2 should be preferably substantially identical to allow the kit 100 to be safely closed."

  "query": "What are the therapeutic applications and benefits of using l-lactate anions over racemic d-l-lactate in fluid therapy solutions?,",
  "negative": "This invention pertains to novel therapeutic fluid compositions that sidestep the development of metabolic disturbances and other adverse reactions caused by traditional drug formulations. Particularly, it focuses on a sterile aqueous solution containing one or more permeable monoanionic metabolites, such as l-tartrate anions, succinate anions, d-levulinate anions, oxaloacetate anions, or their combinations. Here, l-tartrate is recognized as the endogenously occurring isomer in biological tissues, known for its interaction with NAD+ to yield succinate via a reaction mediated by mammalian tartrate dehydrogenase. Unlike previous practices using racemic tartaric acid or succinic acid in medicinal preparations without differentiation of isomeric forms, this invention exclusively uses the endogenously active isomer form, l-tartrate. The earlier literature reported sole usage of racemic mixtures of tartrate and succinate in parenteral fluids. However, new insights have revealed that the therapeutic use of specific isomers, like l-tartrate, may circumvent negative outcomes like encephalopathy and osteopenia which are linked to administrations of non-specific racemic mixtures. Hence, this invention offers a significant leap in patient care by optimizing the composition of therapeutic fluids using carefully selected anions that align with physiological norms and reduce risk factors associated with conventional therapies. The innovative solution can serve similar therapeutic roles to previous fluids containing racemic mixtures but with better safety profiles, efficacious in managing conditions such as acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and other related health issues. These custom preparations can be administered orally, intravenously, and via peritoneal or hemo-dialysis, thus providing flexible and improved treatment options for a variety of medical needs.\n",
  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATION This present application is a continuation-in-part of my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 810,918, filed Dec. 18, 1985, now abandoned, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 748,232, filed June 24, 1985, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,633,166 which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 623,102 filed June 22, 1984, now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention lies in the field of fluid therapy in humans, and more particularly in the field of aqueous solutions for parenteral, oral, dialysis, and irrigation therapy which employ at least one of l-lactate anions, pyruvate anions, d- betahydroxybutyrate anions, acetoacetate anions, or mixtures thereof in combination with selected cations. 2. Prior Art Previously, I have provided improved electrolyte solutions for in vivo and in vitro usage which contain l-lactate and pyruvate anions, and/or d-betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate anions in respective defined ratios in combination with defined Na:Cl ratios; see my copending U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 748,232 and 747,792, both filed June 24, 1985, and also my copending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 747,858 and 748,184, also filed on such date. However, it is now appreciated that the benefits of using l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and/or acetoacetate anions need not be restricted by these previously taught relationships of anion pair ratios to Na:Cl ratios. The prior art indicated in the 37 Background&#34; sections of these earlier patent applications is incorporated by reference into the present application. Previously, only racemic mixtures of lactate anions containing both d- and l- forms of lactate have been used in aqueous solutions for human parenteral therapy. The other major organic anion used in human parenteral fluids has been acetate. So far as is now known, the natural l-form of lactate anion has heretofore never been used, apart from the unnatural d- form, in human fluid therapy. Sodium lactate solutions, used in pharmaceutical practices, are not specified in terms of isomeric structure. In the U.S. and British Pharmacopeias, lactate is defined and approval was duly granted for use of the d,l-lactate mixture. Hence, the d,l-lactate is the form used in contemporary pharmaceutical practice. The l-lactate is recognized to be the physiologically predominant form which is metabolized by different pathways and with different effects than is the d-lactate. The toxicity of d-lactate has been described in humans (see Oh MS et al N Eng J Med 301: 249-251, 1979; Perlmutter, DH et al J Pediatrics 102: 234-238, 1983; Stolberg, L et al N Eno J Med 306: 1344-1348, 1982). Thus, the d- form has now been discovered to cause adverse and toxic effects when administered to mammals. For example, when an aqueous 20 mM/1 d-lactate (or d-lactic acid) is administered parenterally to a rat, swelling of brain tissue is observed because the brain takes in the slowly metabolized d-lactate - plus an equivalent amount of K +. With continued administration, coma develops, the cerebral edema worsens and death ensues. In contrast, when l-lactate is similarly administered, the differential concentration of l-lactate between intracellular and extracellular fluid does not cause coma or death. For another example, Veech et al. (Veech, RL and Fowler, RC., &#34;Cerebral Dysfunction and Respiratory Alkalosis During Peritoneal Dialysis with d-Lactate Containing Peritoneal Dialysis Fluids&#34;. Am. J. Med., 1987 (in press)) points out that the severe recurrent metabolic alkelemia described by Kenamond et al. (&#34;Severe Recurrent Alkalemia in a Patient Undergoing Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis&#34;. Am. J. Med., 548-550, 1986) was secondary to an encephalopathy caused by the inclusion of d,l-lactate in routine dialysis fluids. Because of such encephalopathological results, parenteral solutions containing the racemic d,l-lactate anions should not be administered for therapeutic purposes. All previous commercial formulations of fluids for human therapy use lactate or lactic acid in the racemic d,l form as defined in the United States or British Pharmacopeia (see the United States Pharmacopeia 21st edition, January 1985, p 581, 945-946, 1186; United States Pharmacopeia Convention, Rockville, and British Pharmacopeia 1980, p 250, 666, 667, Her Majesty&#39;s Stationary Office, London). Sodium d,l-lactate solutions are currently and conventionally used for three major purposes in current medical practice. First, sodium d,l-lactate solution is used parenterally as an alkalinizing agent to correct acidosis. Secondly, it is used in parenteral fluid therapy to normalize the Na:Cl ratio from the l:l ratio found in normal saline. Thirdly, it is used as the counter ion in peritoneal dialysis solutions. In addition, it could also be used in current hemodialysis to replace the acetate anion, or, in its H + form, as an acid to be added to a bicarbonate hemodialysis fluid. Prior to the teachings contained in my afore referenced USSN 748,232, pyruvate anions d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, and acetoacetate anions in aqueous solution, so far as is now known, were never used in human therapeutic fluids. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for accomplishing fluid therapy without encephalopathy or metabolic bone disease and other complications resulting from use of present fluid formulations in a living human involving the introduction into the body of such human an aqueous solution containing at least one permeant monoanionic metabolite selected from the group consisting of l-lactate anions, pyruvate anions, d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, acetoacetate anions, or mixtures of such anions. Here, l-lactate is defined as that form of lactate anion found in mammalian tissues and designated l or L-lactate. It is identified by its ability to react with NAD + to form pyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by mammalian lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). The form of l-lactate which is dextrorotatory in aqueous solution is designated l-(+) while the salts of l-lactate which in aqueous solution are levorotatory are designated l-(-)lactate (see US Dispensatory. Osol, A, Pratt, R, Gennar, AR,, eds. p 658. JR Lippcott. Philadelphia, 1973). Pyruvate and acetoacetate have no sterospecificity. More particularly, this invention is directed to improved methods and optionally stable fluids for conventional administration to humans such as, (a) oral ingestion of an aqueous solution containing at least one of such anions, or a mixture of such anions, (b) parenteral therapy involving, for example, the intravenous administration of an aqueous solution containing at least one of such anions, or a mixture thereof, (c) dialysis therapy (hemo or peritoneal) using aqueous solutions containing at least one of such anions, (d) dialysis therapy (hemo or peritoneal) where acetic acid is replaced with at least one acid of the group consisting of l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate or acetoacetic acid, preferably l-lactate, and/or (e) irrigation therapy. One presently preferred such anion comprises 1-lactate. Thus, surprisingly, encephalopathy, metabolic bone disease, and many other complications are not only completely avoided by using 1-lactate (or one of the other metabolite anions herein identified and used in the practice of this invention) in place of racemic d-l-lactate, but also the substitution of, for example, l-lactate for d-l-lactate, in solutions employed in fluid therapy, does not cause any change in the heretofore known beneficial physiological or pharmacological effectiveness of such fluids. In general, a solution containing at least one such anion is administerable for generally the same purposes that prior art parenteral fluids or dialysis fluids are used which contain racemic d-l-lactate anions. For examples, such a solution can be used to treat acidosis, dehydration, blood electrolyte depletion, shock, malnutrition, uremia and the like. Because mixtures of l-lactate anions and pyruvate anions, and mixtures of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions, in solutions each constitute nearequilibrium couples, which can vary widely in concentration under normal physiological conditions, as explained, for example, in my aforereferenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 748,232, these anions can be employed with little or no adverse side effects in parenteral fluids and the like. Moreover, the therapeutic use of these anion couples (a) tends to maintain a normal plasma milliequivalent ratio of sodium cations to chloride anions, (b) thus tends to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis, and (c) accomplishes electrolyte and fluid and resuscitation therapy. The anions taught by this invention permit one to avoid the known untoward effects of high levels of the d-lactate anion (see Veech, RL, Fowler, RC, op. cited above) or of acetate anion which are now the major organic anions conventionally added to parenteral fluids (See Veech RL. The toxic impact of parenteral solutions on the metabolism of cells: a hypothesis for physiological parenteral therapy. Am J Clin Nutr 44: 519-551, 1986). Other and further objects, aims, purposes, features, advantages, embodiments, applications, and the like will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present specification taken together with the claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION For the fluid therapy purposes of my present invention, any conventional administration procedure is suitable, although parenteral (particularly intravenous) administration during hemo or peritoneal dialysis is presently preferred. For example, sodium l-lactate aqueous solutions, which are stable and easily sterilized, can be used in infusion fluids in place of sodium bicarbonate for treatment for acidosis. For example, the bicarbonate may be dissolved immediately before use in the infusion fluid by light agitation and preferably warmed to body temperature. In such a replacement, 1 g sodium bicarbonate corresponds to about 1.33 g sodium l-lactate, and 1 g sodium l-lactate corresponds to about 0.75 g sodium bicarbonate. The bicarbonate or l-lactate solutions are preferrably administered diluted with glucose solution or distilled water. The alkalizing action of sodium l-lactate is diminished in severe liver damage since its breakdown is retarded. See, for example, Documenta Geigy 6th ed, pp. 331-332, Geigy, Manchester, 1962. In practice, the calculation of the quantity of an alkalizing infusion solution required for adults is based on an average value for the water content of the body of 50% by weight and on a uniform intra- and extra-cellular distribution of bicarbonate, l-lactate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and other aforementioned permeant monovalent anionic metabolites. This method naturally yields only rough figures. The calculation can be simplified by reckoning in milliequivalents desired change in the alkali reserve. For example, in order to increase or decrease the alkali reserve in a patient weighing 70 kg by 5 mEq, a quantity of, for example, l-lactate, bicarbonate or d-betahydroxybutyrate anions of 70\u00d76\u00d70.5=210 mEq must be administered. In order to avoid the danger of an acidosis becoming converted into an alkalosis, it is advisable not to attempt a complete normalization of the alkali reserve by means of an alkalizing solution, and such solutions should never be administered without supplementary potassium. In children, a higher water content of about 66% must be reckoned with, so that the calculation yields relatively high infusion quantities. The differences between the calculated and observed effects of alkalizing and of acidifying compounds can be considerable since the above approximate calculation ignores a number of important factors. In diabetic acidosis, many authors consider it is inadvisable to administer large quantities of sodium salts without potassium salts. On the other hand, extremely good results have been reported in the intensive lactate treatment of diabetic coma. There is no doubt that a moderate alkali therapy with l-lactate and/or pyruvate is indicated in diabetic ketosis with very much lowered alkali reserve, since it has been shown that insulin activity is inhibited by acidosis and that acidosis increases the blood sugar. Clearly use of d-betahydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate would not be suitable for use in diabetic ketoacidosis. As those skilled in the art will also appreciate, the ketone bodies would not be appropriate for use in pregnant women. When using solutions such as &#34;Lactated Ringer&#39;s&#34; (see, for example, my aforereferenced USSN 748,232) to replete body water and electrolytes, the 28 mM d,l-lactate of the prior art is replaced with, for example, 28 mM l-lactate. In this way, the Na:Cl ratio, in such an l-lactate solution, is moved, if desired, towards a normal ratio of 1.36 as found in normal human plasma. Thus, hyperchloremic acidosis resulting from large infusions of normal sodium chloride solutions is avoided. The same considerations apply to use of such solutions in dialysis (see, for example, my aforereferenced US patent applications Ser. Nos. 748,232 and 748,184). Alternatively, in all the present new solutions, d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, for example, can be used alternatively in place of l-lactate anions. Additional benefits may accrue from the use alternate or combined use of pyruvate and acetoacetate. A preferred application for this invention involves usage of a mixture of anions of l-lactate and pyruvate, or a mixture of anions d-betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, as indicated, in solutions. Under special circumstances, use of one or the other of such anions alone may be preferred, such as in cases of severe reduction of the pyridine nucleotide systems where administration of pyruvate anions may be preferred. In conditions where long stability of mixed aqueous solutions presents a practical problem, use of l-lactate or d-betahydroxybutyrate alone confers stability on the solution and is to be preferred over the currently used d,l-lactate or acetate. For one example, to correct an acidosis wherein a 70 kg man is 6 mEq below the normal plasma bicarbonate level of 26-30 mEq/L, then 70\u00d76\u00d70.5 or 210 mEq is infused with a fluid of this invention containing bicarbonate anions and l-lactate anions as described hereinbelow, over a 2 to 4 hour period. Other dosages and rates of infusion may be used, if desired, depending on the clinical situation. For a second example, a liter of solution of the composition of the current Ringer&#39;s lactate (for the composition thereof, see my aforereferenced USSN 748,232) may be infused over a four hour period into a dehydrated 70 kg man with the exception that the d,l-lactate used is replaced with l-lactate. For a third example, the prior art accomplishment of peritoneal dialysis by infusion into the peritoneum of 2L of a conventional d,l-lactate based or acetate based peritoneal dialysis solution, is changed in that the 35-45 mM d,l-lactate or acetate is altered and replaced by 35-45mM l-lactate. After remaining in the peritoneum for about 1/2 hour, the fluid is drained off and the process repeated until the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is decreased to the level desired. In parenteral therapy, the total concentration of anions selected from the above indicated anion group, a present preference being l-lactate, pyruvate, and/or mixtures thereof, can range from about 0.01 to 2400 millimoles per liter, though larger and smaller quantities can be used depending upon circumstances. The rate of introduction into a human patient, and the dosage used, are generally the same as are conventionally used in solutions containing, for example, d,l-lactate. A present preference is to employ, for fluid therapy, an aqueous solution wherein the total concentration of l-lactate or pyruvate anions ranges from about 1 Molar to 1 millimolar. In a more preferred form, from about 28 to 45 millimoles (total) of such anions are present (such as in an improved Ringer&#39;s lactate or in improved peritoneal dialysis fluids). Although a solution taught by the present invention may contain either l-lactate or pyruvate alone, as essentially the sole organic metabolic anion, a mixture of l-lactate anions and pyruvate anions may also be used, and similarly a mixture of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions may be used. When such an anion redox couple is employed, it is presently preferred to employ a milliequivalent ratio of l-lactate anions to pyruvate anions in the range from about 20:1 to 1:1, and a milliequivalent ratio of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions to acetoacetate anions in the range from about 6:1 to 0.5:1. The l-lactic, pyruvic, d-betahydroxybutyric, and acetoacetic acids themselves as such, may be used. For example, such can be used in combination with aqueous bicarbonate anions; for instance, in sodium bicarbonate containing solutions. Also, one can employ, in the starting solutions used in the processes of present invention, aqueous solutions which contain, along with such metabolite anions as taught in this invention, at least one cation selected from the group consisting of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ammonium. Preferably, from about 0.01 to 2400 millimoles per liter of such anions are present. Inorganic physiologically acceptable anions, besides bicarbonate, may also be present, such as chloride, phosphate, and sulfate, if desired, and if such are present, the respective quantities present are preferably similar to corresponding physiologic levels. A difference between the total milliequvalents of the cations present in a solution and the total milliequivalents of the organic anions of the specified group employed in the practice of this invention (l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate) can be provided by other physiologically acceptable anions. It is considered to be physiologically advantageous and it is generally preferred in the practice of this invention, to maintain the levels of the respective organic metabolite anions employed at values which are approximately physiologic. Also, when a mixture of the monocarboxylic metabolic anions is employed in a given solution, it is not necessary to employ redox couple anion pairs since this use of these defined monocarboxylic metabolite anions does not produce the toxic effects resulting from the present use of d,l-lactate or acetate. Further, it appears to be desirable to employ such anionic metabolites in combination with bicarbonate anions in conditions where large volumes of fluid are to be used and administration of calories is not desired, such as in peritoneal dialysis. Additionally and preferably, such a solution may contain dissolved therein at least one osmotically active, substantially nonionic substance in accord with, for example, teachings for prior art d,l-lactate and acetate containing solutions. Examples of suitable such nonionic substances include glucose (preferred), fructose, glycerol, sorbitol, and the like. Typically, and preferably, such a solution has an osmolarity ranging from about 240 to 2400 mOsmoles/liter. In addition, formulations containing ionic nutrients, such as l- amino acids, can benefit from the addition of at least one of the metabolite monocarboxylic acid anions taught herein. For example, the acetate anions present in current commercial amino acid formulations (which lead to metabolic bone disease) can be replaced by such anions. See, for example, my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 810,916, filed Dec. 18, 1985, and its continuation-in-part application filed on even date herewith, all the teachings of which are entirely incorporated hereinto by reference. Also preferably, a starting solution used in the practice of this invention has a pH in the range from about 5 to 9, although for the contemplated human usage, a most preferred pH is about 7.4."

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0025] Reference is made first to FIG. 1 which is a top plan view of the playing arena of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1 discloses playing arena 10 as comprising a generally circular or elliptical enclosure surrounding a playing field 20 and, in the preferred embodiment, providing adequate seating for an array of fans surrounding playing field 20. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention it is anticipated that the fan audience seating arrangement for the Arena Baseball game will be generally smaller than that of existing Major League Baseball (MLB) fields. One object of the present invention is to create more of an audience participatory environment for the fans attending the baseball game. Towards such end, the enclosure defining playing arena 10 should be smaller than a typical open air baseball stadium, but somewhat larger than the typical closed basketball arena. [0026] Further disclosed in FIG. 1 (in this top plan view) are outfield enclosure 12 , first base side enclosure 14 , and third base side enclosure 16. The specific structure of each of these enclosures is described in more detail below. Overarching the entire playing field 20 is retractable netting 18. Retractable netting 18 is supported in this first preferred embodiment by a mid-field ceiling support 32 comprising an arching semi-rigid support component extending from behind home plate to the outfield enclosure 12 in the vicinity of center field. [0027] Associated with what is the equivalent of the infield in the standard American Baseball field configuration are the usual home plate, first base, second base, and third base. Defined in FIG. 1 and utilized as part of the method of play for the Arena Baseball game, are home slide zone 22 , first base slide zone 24 , second base slide zone 26 , and third base slide zone 28. Positioned in the center of the infield area is pitcher&#39;s mound 30. [0028] Also positioned in the center field area, above outfield enclosure 12 , is scoreboard display (replay screen) 35. This structural component is important for audience participation in a number of the preferred embodiments of the game method of play of the present invention. Overall, the components of the Arena Baseball game structure of the present invention, shown generally as the playing arena 10 of FIG. 1 , are structured to be similar to standard American Baseball, but fully enclose the playing area so as to allow the audience to position themselves very close to the activity within the playing area. The various surrounding enclosures and retractable netting components allow for the continuous play of the Arena Baseball game, according to the various rules described in more detail below, especially those relating to the play of balls off of the walls and ceiling enclosure components. [0029] Reference is next made to FIG. 2 which is a perspective view of the playing arena of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown from the top in FIG. 1. In this view of FIG. 2 , playing arena 10 is again shown to be framed by outfield enclosure 12 and home plate backstop enclosure 13. Likewise, first base side enclosure 14 and third base side enclosure 16 are disclosed with their elevational configuration. Retractable netting 18 is shown to comprise an array of net panels forming the upper sections of the sidewalls and the arching sections of the ceiling for the overall enclosure. [0030] Playing field 20 is again shown to comprise a layout generally consistent with a standard American baseball field. Mid-field ceiling support 32 is shown to extend in a manner that provides a central support to retractable netting 18. The various surrounding enclosures seen from above in FIG. 1 are now disclosed in FIG. 2 as being comprised of multiple components. Positioned on the ground level for each of these enclosures are a number of padded wall sections 34. The structure of these lower wall portions is similar to the wall panels associated with hockey arenas, typically referred to as \u201cbanger boards\u201d. At the base of each wall portion are the padded wall sections 34 over which are positioned various transparent wall components. Third base side banger board wall 50 is shown extending from an area generally adjacent home plate out to left field corner support 56. In a similar manner, first base side banger board wall 51 extends from an area adjacent home plate to right field corner support 54. Home plate backstop banger board wall 52 is positioned in the area immediately behind home plate and connects the third base and first base side banger board walls 50 &amp; 51. [0031] As indicated above, positioned on top of the padded wall sections 34 , for all of the enclosures around playing field 20 , are transparent panels that allow the audience to safely view the action during the Arena Baseball game. Right side transparent backstop 58 is positioned above and to the right of the home plate area. Left side transparent backstop 60 is positioned above and to the left of the home plate area. Center transparent backstop 62 is positioned directly over home plate backstop banger board wall 52. In a similar manner, right field transparent mid-wall 64 is positioned on top of the various padded wall sections 34 that make up first base side banger board wall 51. Left field transparent mid-wall 66 likewise sits atop the padded wall sections 34 positioned within third base side banger board wall 50. Outfield transparent mid-wall 68 , in a similar manner, sits atop padded wall sections 34 that make up outfield banger board wall 70. [0032] Also shown in FIG. 2 are examples of ball action that might occur during the game method of play of the Arena Baseball game. As indicated above, one object of the present invention is to allow the audience to safely view the activity during the Arena Baseball game, while the rebound rule components of the game are carried out. The fully enclosed playing field 20 is intended to permit the use of rebound rules in the game method of play as described in detail below. Two examples of this are shown in FIG. 2 where baseball (or softball) 36 is directed from a position near home plate in any of a number of different directions within the enclosed playing field. These motion (rebound) ball paths 38 in one instance result in ball path 80 wherein the ball is reflected off of the ceiling netting component. In a second instance, the ball moves in ball path 82 wherein the ball is reflected off of the third base side enclosure. Each of these ball paths may result in an \u201cin play\u201d ball according to the rules of the Arena Baseball game, again as described in more detail below. [0033] Reference is next made to FIG. 3 which is a top plan view of the playing arena of a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, in this case defined by a ceiling attachment ring for the retractable netting. Playing arena 10 , as shown in FIG. 3 , once again comprises a generally circular or elliptical enclosure surrounding playing field 20 and again in this embodiment provides adequate seating for an array of fans surrounding playing field 20. Also disclosed in the top plan view of FIG. 3 are outfield enclosure 12 , first base side enclosure 14 , and third base enclosure side 16. The specific structures of each of these enclosures are as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. [0034] In the second preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 3 , however, retractable netting 18 extends over playing field 20 and is supported by a combination of support structures, including mid-field ceiling attachment ring 33 , outfield ceiling ring support 37 , and infield ceiling ring support 39. This ceiling attachment ring 33 and the ceiling ring supports 37 &amp; 39 each comprise semi-rigid support components that extend from the enclosure walls and support the flexible retractable netting 18. The balance of the components of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 , including scoreboard display (replay screen) 35 , are similar to those same components described above in conjunction with FIGS. 1 &amp; 2. [0035] Reference is next made to FIG. 4 which is a side elevational view of the playing field enclosure of either of the first or second preferred embodiments of the present invention. The view in FIG. 4 provides a profile view of the structure as it may be seen by individuals in the fan audience seating arranged along the third base side of the playing arena. In the view of FIG. 4 , a portion of outfield enclosure 12 is disclosed, as is all of third base side enclosure 16. Positioned behind the home plate area is home plate backstop enclosure 13. Disclosed as part of third base side enclosure 16 are padded wall sections 34 similar to those described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. [0036] Also shown in FIG. 4 is one possible arrangement for the ceiling structure that provides the necessary support for retractable netting 18 that forms the interior ceiling above the playing field. Mid-field ceiling support 32 is shown to be a semi-rigid component that extends across the entire playing field from behind home plate to a center point in the outfield. Various other support structures connect the enclosure walls 12 , 13 , &amp; 16 in this view, with midfield ceiling support 32. These include rigid left field corner support 56 and a number of third base side ceiling cables 57 a - 57 c."

  "negative": "Dough processing companies focus on preserving the texture and volume of packaged bread products while maintaining their nutritional profile. The process of preserving the original texture in the bread manufacturing industry encounters obstacles, especially when adjusting calcium enrichment without affecting the desired organoleptic characteristics. Efficient production practices in bread manufacturing include optimizing the evolution of gases, such as carbon dioxide, during packaging. This process ensures the dough's proper expansion to fill the packaging space, maintaining the bread's quality. A noteworthy point in the optimization process is utilizing complex combinations of ingredients and processing steps to achieve the bread's final properties. Growth factors of the microbes used in the starter cultures might require careful consideration as they interact with the dough's expansion and stabilization during the bread's shelf life. Ingredients commonly used in the bread industry for their functional lifting properties may include various types of baking agents, but an excessive rate of gas release from such agents might compromise product integrity or necessitate complicated packaging solutions. Despite advancements in leavening technology, bread manufacturers have not often implemented calcium-based agents due to their inadequate quick responsiveness in certain types of dough, potentially leading to insufficient expansion and sealing within the packaging.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND [0001] Refrigerated, canned dough products have been very popular with consumers. In addition to the ease of use of canned dough products, the quality of the baked products made from refrigerated, canned dough has vastly improved over the years. [0002] As consumers demand more high quality, nutritious food products, consumer food product manufacturers work to continue to develop food products that meet these consumer demands. Balancing the nutrition profile of a food product with its desired organoleptic properties has often been a challenge to consumer food product manufacturers. As such, manufacturers seek to increase the nutritive value of a food product without noticeably altering its organoleptic properties by using food ingredients that have the requisite functional properties but have added nutritive value, such as added vitamins and minerals. [0003] Refrigerated dough product manufacturers, in addition to facing the nutrition demands of consumers, are faced with the challenge of meeting these demands while working within the constraints associated with refrigerated dough product manufacturing, which in large part revolve around optimizing the rate of carbon dioxide gas generation in a canned dough system. Such optimization makes it possible to rapidly expand the dough to reach a desired volume, thereby reducing headspace gas volume and the concomitant loss in dough and finished product quality. The initial expansion of the leavened dough to seal a ventable can from within is followed by an increase in the pressure within the can resulting from the continued carbon dioxide generation by the leavening agents. The pressure increase and gas generation help to build and sustain the internal gas cell structure of the dough, which results in excellent finished product characteristics typically associated with leavened dough products. [0004] The ability to optimize the rate of carbon dioxide generation in a canned dough system has, however, been a challenge to refrigerated dough manufacturers for decades. Without such optimization, a canned refrigerated dough product suffers from not sufficiently proofing and expanding to seal the can, which results in irreversible product failure. Refrigerated dough manufacturers therefore constantly strive to develop and utilize ingredients, formulations, systems and processes to attain the optimum rate of carbon dioxide generation in refrigerated dough products on a commercial scale. [0005] It has been uniquely challenging for refrigerated canned dough manufacturers to provide consumers with food products with an increased nutritive value while attempting to optimize carbon dioxide generation because of the delicate balance of ingredients, formulations, systems and processes required to achieve a suitable refrigerated dough product. Even ingredients that are intended to be used in dough products often do not meet the complex requirements of a refrigerated canned dough system. [0006] One example of such an ingredient is a calcium-based leavening acid, such as calcium acid pyrophosphate. Calcium based leavening acids, while having many desirable properties, have typically been difficult to use in canned or packaged refrigerated dough systems because these leavening acids generally do not react fast enough to generate carbon dioxide at or above a critical rate of gas evolution, and therefore are unable to suitably expand the dough to seal the package or can from within, and then pressurize the dough within the package or can. As such, calcium-based leavening agents, although having the benefit of potentially increasing the calcium level and decreasing the sodium level of products made from dough, have not typically been used in the industry to manufacture refrigerated canned dough products. SUMMARY [0007] It has been unexpectedly discovered that by using leavening agents, which are typically encapsulated, in their unencapsulated form, in combination with a calcium-based leavening acid, it is possible to achieve or exceed the critical rate of gas evolution for a particular product while improving the nutritional properties of the product. [0008] The present invention is directed to a refrigerated dough system which includes a dough product contained in a package. The dough product includes a base, an expansion leavening acid, and a pressurization leavening acid. The pressurization leavening acid may be a calcium-based leavening acid. The base, expansion leavening acid, and pressurization leavening acid are each unencapsulated. The expansion leavening acid, when combined with the base, is capable of generating gas which causes the dough product to expand to a degree sufficient to seal the package from within. The pressurization leavening acid, when combined with the base, is capable of generating gas within the dough product to pressurize the dough product after the package is sealed. The internal system pressure is sustained inside the package under refrigeration conditions over a period of time. This internal system pressure is less than the pressure sustained by the expansion leavening acid at a 100% neutralizing value in a similar dough product, and greater than the pressure sustained by the pressurization leavening acid at a 100% neutralizing value in a similar dough product. [0009] The present invention is also directed to a method of making a refrigerated dough product. This method involves mixing dough ingredients, including an unencapsulated leavening base, an unencapsulated expansion leavening acid, and an unencapsulated pressurization leavening acid, together to make a dough. The dough is then placed inside a ventable package with an opening. The opening of the package is subsequently closed to create a headspace including air inside the package. After the opening is closed, the package is sealed from within by action of the expansion leavening acid and the base, which together generate gas in the dough to expand the dough, thereby venting out the air in the headspace and filling the headspace with expanded dough. Pressure is then generated inside the package by action of the pressurization leavening acid and the base, which together generate additional gas in the expanded dough. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0010] FIG. 1 shows plots of can pressure, after 24 hours, versus the weight of the canned dough for dough products prepared using the following leavening acids: glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) as the sole leavening acid at a 25% neutralizing value; LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent as the sole leavening acid at a 75% neutralizing value; and a combination of GDL at a 25% neutralizing value and LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value.

[0013] FIG. 4 shows plots of volume of CO 2 evolved over time for dough products prepared using the following leavening acids: GDL at a 100% neutralizing value; CAL-RISE\u00ae calcium acid pyrophosphate leavening agent at a 100% neutralizing value; GDL at a 25% neutralizing value; CAL-RISE\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value; and a combination of GDL at a 25% neutralizing value and CAL-RISE\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value. [0014] FIG. 5 shows plots of volume of CO 2 evolved over time for dough products prepared using the following leavening acids: GDL at a 100% neutralizing value; LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 100% neutralizing value; GDL at a 25% neutralizing value; LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value; and a combination of GDL at a 25% neutralizing value and LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value. DESCRIPTION [0015] Leavening agents having various rates of carbon dioxide generation have been used to prepare canned refrigerated dough products. The problems associated with using these leavening agents stem from their very nature\u2014the slow-acting leavening agents generate carbon dioxide so slowly that some of the generated gas escapes out of the package before the dough is sufficiently proofed to fill and seal the package, rather than being entrapped within the dough, causing poor dough conditions and volume. In addition, slow-acting leavening agents that contain phosphates may have taste issues that limit their use and may require additional ingredients to achieve the desired taste profile in the finished product. [0016] Fast-acting leavening agents, on the other hand, generate carbon dioxide quickly, sometimes while the dough ingredients are being mixed, so the dough begins to expand before it is suitably packaged to retain the gas within the dough. To overcome the problems associated with fast-acting leavening agents, one or more of the leavening components (acid and/or base) are encapsulated to slow the reaction rate. Encapsulated leavening agents are typically much more expensive than conventional leavening agents, and are not entirely problem free, as the encapsulation material may still prematurely release the leavening agent. Other methods of \u201csequestering\u201d one or more of the fast-acting leavening agents is by laminating the dough, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,801. [0017] The leavening composition in accordance with the present invention can be used to make a packaged dough product of the present invention, wherein the dough in the package is sufficiently expanded to seal the package from within, and the package is sufficiently pressurized by the dough expansion to retain gas within the dough, which ultimately results in desirable baked product characteristics. The package may be a ventable composite can, such as the packages described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,510,050 and 3,879,563. Other types of ventable cans and other ventable packaging are also contemplated to be suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. \u201cVentable can\u201d as used herein shall refer to any can or other package having at least one vent through which headspace air may escape from the can as the dough expands inside the can to seal the can from within. [0018] In one embodiment of the present invention, the dough product includes a leavening composition comprising an unencapsulated leavening base and a blend of leavening acids. The leavening acids include an expansion leavening acid and a pressurization leavening acid. Either or both of the expansion leavening acid and pressurization leavening acid can be unencapsulated. The expansion leavening acid is capable of generating gas when combined with the base to initially proof and expand the dough product to a degree sufficient to cause the dough to seal the package from within the package. The pressurization leavening agent is capable, when combined with the base, of generating gas within the dough product to subsequently pressurize the dough product inside the sealed package in an amount sufficient to sustain an internal system pressure inside the package under refrigeration conditions over a period of time. This period of time ranges from about 1 day to about 120 days. [0019] In this embodiment, the internal system pressure of the dough product, inside the package under refrigeration conditions over a period of time, is lower than the pressure that is sustained by the expansion leavening acid acting individually at a 100% neutralizing value in a similar dough. The internal system pressure of the dough product, inside the package under refrigeration conditions over a period of time, is also greater than the pressure that is sustained by the pressurization leavening acid acting individually at a 100% neutralizing value in a similar dough. [0020] As used herein, the expression \u201cneutralizing value\u201d refers to a level of the leavening acid required to react with and neutralize the recited percentage of the leavening base in a given product. The period of time can range from about 1 day to about 120 days, for example, from about 30 days to about 90 days. The internal system pressure can range from about 8 psi to about 20 psi, for example, from about 10 psi to about 20 psi. [0021] In this embodiment, the expansion leavening acid and the pressurization leavening acid are present in the dough at a ratio of from about 10:90 to about 40:60, prior to reacting with the base. At least one of the expansion leavening acid and the pressurization leavening acid is substantially free of sodium. [0022] The expansion leavening acid may be a fast-acting leavening agent, such as, but not limited to, glucono-delta-lactone and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Useful examples of expansion leavening acids are those that are capable of causing sufficient dough expansion to seal a can from inside the can at temperatures ranging from about 40\u00b0 F. to about 70\u00b0 F. for a period of time sufficient to seal the can, depending, among other things, on the internal can volume and the amount of dough placed inside the can. In some cases, the period of time for sealing the can varies from about 24 hours to about 72 hours after the dough is placed inside the ventable can through its open end and the open end is closed. [0023] The pressurization leavening acid may be a slow-acting leavening agent such as, but not limited to, calcium acid pyrophosphate. Possible slow-acting leavening agents include the CAL-RISE\u00ae leavening agent, which is available from Innophos, Inc. of Cranbury, N.J., US, and LEVONA\u00ae leavening agents, which are available from ICL Performance Products LP of St. Louis, Mo., US. Possible LEVONA\u00ae leavening agents for use in this invention include LEVONA\u00ae OPUS leavening agent, LEVONA\u00ae BR10 leavening agent, and LEVONA\u00ae MEZZO leavening agent. [0024] Although the types of leavening acids have been described herein as \u201cexpansion\u201d and \u201cpressurization\u201d, those skilled in the art will appreciate that these expressions describe the major function of the leavening acids, but are not intended to preclude each type of leavening acid from performing other functions to a lesser degree as well. For example, although a faster acting expansion leavening agent serves primarily to quickly expand the dough, the same leavening agent may, to some degree, assist with pressurizing the dough over time. Similarly, even though the slower acting pressurization leavening acid serves primarily to generate gas within the dough to sustain an internal pressure within the package over time after the dough has been packaged, the same leavening acid may, to some extent, contribute to the initial dough expansion. [0025] While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that there is a critical rate of gas evolution required in a dough product, below which the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the canned dough and escapes out of the vent or vents in the can, but above which the dough can proof and expand to seal the ventable can from within, following which the necessary pressure within the can may be generated by continued gas evolution. This rate of gas evolution is dependent on many conditions, such as the type of dough and leavening agent, the package volume, and the like. [0026] The following examples demonstrate the principles involved in the present invention, but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. All dough products described herein comprise flour, water, and a leavening system, but those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention encompasses dough products comprising additional dough ingredients, such as, but not limited to, plasticizers, stabilizers, conditioners, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, coloring agents, particulate materials, preservation agents, and the like. Example I [0027] The overall can pressure of a canned dough product is affected by individual component contributions to can pressure and by the rate of reaction and interactions within the packaged dough system. Can pressures greater than those attained through the use of individual leavening components can be achieved by manipulating the reaction rate of the leavening agents in the dough to achieve the critical rate of gas evolution. [0028] When calcium acid pyrophosphate is used alone as a leavening acid, the proofing is insufficient to promote effective can pressure. Therefore, the use of calcium acid pyrophosphate, such as LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent, as the sole leavening acid does not result in an acceptable canned dough product. The LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent acting alone will not develop acceptable can pressure, even when the leavening acid is at a 100% neutralizing value. [0029] When glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) is used alone as a leavening acid at a low level, a low can pressure is also observed. Furthermore, if the level of GDL is increased, although more gas is generated, it is generated at a rate that is too fast to suitably package the dough. In many cases, if the level of GDL in the dough is increased, the resulting pressure leads to package failure. For these reasons, GDL is conventionally used with an encapsulated base, typically known as \u201ce-soda\u201d. GDL may itself be used in an encapsulated form to delay the onset of the leavening reaction. [0030] When calcium acid pyrophosphate, such as LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent, and GDL are combined, there is a sufficient rate of reaction to initially expand the dough to seal the can, and to continue to proof the dough and develop acceptable can pressure. GDL or sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), and many other leavening acids, can be used in conjunction with a leavening agent comprising calcium acid pyrophosphate to achieve appropriate dough expansion and can pressure development to promote effective proofing in canned dough products. [0031] The can pressures of canned dough products using the following leavening acids were measured: 1) GDL at a 25% neutralizing value; 2) LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value; and 3) a combination of GDL at a 25% neutralizing value and LEVONA\u00ae leavening agent at a 75% neutralizing value. Sodium bicarbonate was used as the leavening base, and all the leavening agents were unencapsulated. The results of these experiments are shown in the plots of FIGS."

  "negative": "Medical procedures often require advanced equipment to assist in the rehabilitation of visual impairments. A leading approach involves the implantation of a synthetic lens within the optical pathway of the eye. Such a lens is crafted from biocompatible materials, including specialized polymers, to replace or supplement the eye's natural lens. The advanced lens design incorporates a focal adjustment mechanism that responds to natural ocular muscle interactions, enabling the patient to experience improved vision for both near and distant objects. The lens architecture features a central optical sector linked to a non-optic periphery. This innovative design harmonizes with the eye's anatomy, maneuvering the visual medium within the lens in concert with muscle motions, thus modulating the focal strength of the lens. Comprised of an anterior surface that is seamlessly integrated into the overall structure, the lens achieves these functional changes without the typical mechanical adjustments, providing a more natural and dynamic visual enhancement.\n\n",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cataracts are a major cause of blindness in the world and the most prevalent ocular disease. When the disability from cataracts affects or alters an individual&#39;s activities of daily living, surgical lens removal with intraocular lens (\u201cIOL\u201d) implantation is the preferred method of treating the functional limitations. A cataract is any opacity of a patient&#39;s lens, whether it is a localized opacity or a diffuse general loss of transparency. To be clinically significant, however, the cataract must cause a significant reduction in visual acuity or a functional impairment. A cataract occurs as a result of aging or secondary to hereditary factors, trauma, inflammation, metabolic or nutritional disorders, or radiation. Age-related cataract conditions are the most common. In treating a cataract, the surgeon removes the crystalline lens matrix from the lens capsule and replaces it with an IOL. The typical IOL provides a selected focal length that allows the patient to have fairly good distance vision. Since the lens can no longer accommodate, however, the patient typically needs glasses for reading. More specifically, the imaging properties of the human eye are facilitated by several optical interfaces. A healthy youthful human eye has a total power of approximately 59 diopters, with the anterior surface of the cornea (e.g., the exterior surface, including the tear layer) providing about 48 diopters of power, while the posterior surface provides about \u22124 diopters. The crystalline lens, which is situated posterior of the pupil in a transparent elastic capsule, also referred to herein as \u201ccapsular sac,\u201d supported by the ciliary muscles via zonules, provides about 15 diopters of power, and also performs the critical function of focusing images upon the retina. This focusing ability, referred to as \u201caccommodation,\u201d enables imaging of objects at various distances. The power of the lens in a youthful eye can be adjusted from 15 diopters to about 29 diopters by adjusting the shape of the lens from a moderately convex shape to a highly convex shape. The mechanism generally accepted to cause this adjustment is that ciliary muscles supporting the capsule (and the lens contained therein) move between a relaxed state (corresponding to the moderately convex shape) and a contracted state (corresponding to the highly convex shape). Because the lens itself is composed of viscous, gelatinous transparent fibers, arranged in an \u201conion-like\u201d layered structure, forces applied to the capsule by the ciliary muscles via the zonules cause the lens to change shape. Isolated from the eye, the relaxed capsule and lens take on a more spherical shape. Within the eye, however, the capsule is connected around its circumference by approximately 70 tiny ligament fibers to the ciliary muscles, which in turn are attached to an inner surface of the eyeball. The ciliary muscles that support the lens and capsule therefore are believed to act in a sphincter-muscular mode. Accordingly, when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, the capsule and lens are pulled about the circumference to a larger diameter, thereby flattening the lens, whereas when the ciliary muscles are contracted the lens and capsule relax somewhat and assume a smaller diameter that approaches a more spherical shape. As noted above, the youthful eye has approximately 14 diopters of accommodation. As a person ages, the lens hardens and becomes less elastic, so that by about age 45-50, accommodation is reduced to about 2 diopters. At a later age the lens may be considered to be non-accommodating, a condition known as \u201cpresbyopia\u201d. Because the imaging distance is fixed, presbyopia typically entails the need for bi-focals to facilitate near and far vision. Apart from age-related loss of accommodation ability, such loss is innate to the placement of IOLs for the treatment of cataracts. IOLs are generally single element lenses made from a suitable polymer material, such as acrylics or silicones. After placement, accommodation is no longer possible, although this ability is typically already lost for persons receiving an IOL. There is significant need to provide for accommodation in IOL products so that IOL recipients will have accommodating ability. Although efforts have been made with accommodating IOLs, there is a need for an accommodating IOL that can restore as much accommodation to the eye as possible. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the invention is an accommodating intraocular lens. The lens includes an optic portion comprising an anterior element, a posterior element, and an intermediate layer disposed along an optical path of the lens, wherein the intermediate layer is disposed between the anterior element and the posterior element. The lens also includes a peripheral portion in fluid communication with the optic portion. The intraocular lens is adapted such that when a flowable media is moved between the peripheral portion and the optic portion in response to ciliary muscle movement, at least two of the anterior element, the posterior element, and the intermediate layer move from a first configuration to a second configuration. In some embodiments the posterior element comprises a channel formed therein, and wherein the posterior element and the intermediate layer define an active channel in fluid communication with the peripheral portion.

In some embodiments the intermediate layer comprises an actuator. The actuator can be in contact with the anterior element throughout an entire accommodation range of the intraocular lens, or the actuator may not be in contact with the anterior element throughout an entire accommodation range of the intraocular lens. The actuator assumes a substantially conical configuration in a disaccommodated configuration. In some embodiments the peripheral portion is coupled to the posterior element.

In some embodiments the intermediate layer and the anterior element define a passive chamber containing a second flowable media therein. The anterior element, the intermediate layer, the posterior element, the second flowable media, and the flowable media can all be substantially indexed matched to one another. In some embodiments the at least two of the anterior element, the posterior element, and the intermediate layer that move from a first configuration to a second configuration are the intermediate layer and the anterior element.

FIG. 21 illustrates dimensions of an exemplary haptic. FIG. 22 shows an exemplary haptic design and a capsule in accommodated and disaccommodated configurations. FIGS. 23 and 24 show an alternative haptic design comprising bellows. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to intraocular lenses (\u201cIOLs\u201d) and particularly to accommodating intraocular lenses. In preferred embodiments the IOL includes a flowable media (such as a fluid, gelatinous material, etc.) that is moved within the IOL, in response to ciliary muscle movement, to change the power of the IOL. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the structure and operation of a human eye. Eye 100 includes cornea 1 , iris 2 , ciliary muscles 3 , ligament fibers or zonules 4 , capsule 5 , lens 6 and retina 7. Natural lens 6 is composed of viscous, gelatinous transparent fibers, arranged in an \u201conion-like\u201d layered structure, and is disposed in transparent elastic capsule 5. Capsule 5 is joined by zonules 4 around its circumference to ciliary muscles 3 , which are in turn attached to the inner surface of eye 0. Vitreous 8 is a highly viscous, transparent fluid that fills the center of eye 100. Isolated from the eye, the relaxed capsule and lens take on a convex shape. However, when suspended within the eye by zonules 4 , capsule 5 moves between a moderately convex shape (when the ciliary muscles are relaxed) and a highly convex shape (when the ciliary muscles are contracted). As shown in FIG. 2A , when ciliary muscles 3 relax, capsule 5 and lens 6 are pulled about the circumference, thereby flattening the lens. As shown in FIG. 2B , when ciliary muscles 3 contract, capsule 5 and lens 6 relax and become thicker. This allows the lens and capsule to assume a more convex shape, thus increasing the diopter power of the lens. Additionally, various natural mechanisms affect the design requirements of the present invention. For example, during accommodation the pupil naturally stops down (i.e., reduces in diameter) which reduces the area of the natural lens that transmits light. In addition, the eye will experience the Stiles-Crawford Effect which also reduces the effective area of the natural lens. In particular, the brightness of light rays incident on cones in the eye is dependent on the angle at which those rays are incident on the cones. In particular, light rays that strike the cones perpendicular to their surface appear brighter than those that do not. As a result, the light rays passing through the periphery of the lens are less significant for proper vision. FIGS. 3-5 show a first embodiment of accommodating IOL 10. IOL 10 includes a peripheral non-optic portion comprising haptics 12 and 14. The IOL also includes an optic portion including anterior lens element 16 , intermediate layer 18 which comprises actuator 20 , and substrate, or posterior element 22. Anterior element 16 is bonded to intermediate layer 18 at its periphery. In some embodiments the anterior element may also be bonded to actuator 20. The intermediate layer is also bonded to posterior element 22. The inner surface of haptics 12 and 14 define interior volumes 24 which are in fluid communication with active channel 26 defined by posterior element 22 and intermediate layer 18. As shown, actuator 20 is integral with intermediate layer 18. Posterior element 22 is molded with buttresses 11 which include a buttress bore 13 therethrough. The haptics have a haptic attachment element 15 (which can be stiff or flexible) which is sized and shaped to fit within buttress bore 13. An adhesive layer can be applied to the outer surfaces of the haptic attachment elements and/or the inner surface of the buttress bore to facilitate attachment of the haptics to the optic portion."

No. 07/614,365, filed Nov. 16, 1990, entitled &#34;Semduramicin Premix&#34; (now abandoned). TECHNICAL FIELD The field of art to which this invention pertains is animal premixes and particularly, Semduramicin premixes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many animal drugs are administered by admixture with the animal feed. Typically, to facilitate a uniform drugfeed mixture a drug-feed premix is prepared because of the very low concentration of drug to feed used. The concentrated drug premix is added to and mixed through batches of feed. Premixes are characterized by a variety of associated properties such as stability, flowability, and dustiness. Typical premixes represent a compromise of the above properties, as for example, an increase in flowability may adversely affect the dustiness of the premix. Although there are a variety of premixes there is a continual search in this field of art for premixes that exhibit an improved mix of properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to an animal premix having improved levels of flowability and dustiness. The premix comprises about 2% to about 10% Semduramicin or its pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts thereof, about 0.5% to about 50% Semduramicin degradation reducing stabilizer, about 40% to about 80% diluent, about 5% to about 50% density-increasing bulking agent, about 2% to about 10% dust controlling oil and about 0.25% to about 5% flowability enhancing glidant selected from the group consisting of sodium aluminosilicate and silicon dioxide. The invention is also directed to an animal feed containing the above described premix and a method of treating coccidial infections in an animal by administering that animal feed to an animal.

Semduramicin is active against a variety of microorganisms and is effective in controlling coccidiosis, enteritis and swine dysentery as well as being effective in promotion of growth and/or improving efficiency of feed utilization in swine and ruminants. Any amount of Semduramicin may be used in the premix that provides the desired efficacy, for the above described applications, when the premix is mixed with feed and fed to the animal. However, typically, the Semduramicin will be present in an amount from about 2 to 10% by weight of total premix. (Where used herein, the &#34;%&#34; symbol is meant to define percent by weight.) The preferred amount is 5 to 7% by weight. These amounts have been shown to be efficacious when administered to animals in the conventional feedmix of about 1 pound premix to 1 ton feed. The especially preferred use level in chicken feed is generally in the range of 15 to 128 ppm. A typical Semduramicin particle size is about 5 to about 100 micron. Typically a fine particle stabilizer (e.g. about 0.1mm to about 0.8 mm) that is effective in substantially reducing the degrade%ion (e.g. hydrolysis) of Semduramicin is added to the premix. Monovalent basic or neutral salts, for example sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate, potassium carbonate and sodium phosphate are effective. Preferably sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate or sodium chloride is used. It is believed that the presence of the salt reduces the solubility of the Semduramicin (when present as a salt) through the common ion effect. In addition, materials that increase the alkalinity of the medium appear to increase the stability of the drug (e.g. sodium carbonate). Any amount of stabilizer may be used that is effective in stabilizing the Semduramicin. However, typically about 0.5% to about 50% stabilizer is added to the premix. Actually little advantage in stabilization is achieved with levels above about 10%, and high levels of stabilizer may lead to insufficient quantities of other components. Below about 0.5% the desired stability is typically not achieved. Preferably about 3% to about 6% stabilizer is added to the premix. In order to achieve the desired predetermined premix concentration, a carrier (i.e. diluent) is typically used as a component of the premix. Typically the particle size is about 0.1 to about 0.9 mm. The desired premix concentration of Semduramicin depends on the desired rate of addition of premix to finished feed. A diluent is typically an edible substance used to mix with and reduce the concentration of nutrients and/or additives to make them more acceptable to animals, safer to use, and more capable of being mixed uniformly in a feed. Exemplary diluents are plant byproducts however other suitable diluents include vermiculite, almond shells, rapeseed meal and limestone. The term by-products refers to secondary products that are produced in plant processing in addition to the principle product. Generally this means low cost, low nutritional, but edible materials. Preferred plant by-products are grain by-products and vegetable by-products. Preferable grain byproducts diluent are soybean based, rice based, wheat based, and corn based. Especially preferred diluents are soybean mill run, soybean meal, soybean hulls, soybean grits, rice hulls, rice bran, rice husks, wheat bran, wheat middlings, wheat meal, wheat germ, corn cob, corn meal, corn gluten, corn cob grits and corn germ meal. Typically about 40% to about 80% diluent is used. However it is preferred that about 40% to about 60% diluent is used because below about 40% an undesirable quantity of the below described bulking agent may be required and above 60% the premix density may be too low. It is especially preferred that about 45% to about 55% diluent is used. An amount of fine particle bulking agent (e.g. about 0.1 mm to about 0.9 mm) effective provide the premix with bulk density of about 30 to about 50 lbs/ft 3 is added to the premix. Because of the low density of for example, the diluent, the bulking agent increases the density to the desired commercial level. Typical bulking agents have a density of about 2.5 g/ml to about 3.0 g/ml. Exemplary bulking agents are inert, high density materials (e.g. inert minerals, salts). Preferred bulking agents are limestone, sodium carbonate, kaolin, bentonite, oyster shells and sodium sulfate. Typically about 5% to about 50% bulking is added to the premix, however it is preferred to add about 30% to about 40% bulking agent because below about 30% the premix density may be too low. An amount of oil effective to control dust is added to the premix. Generally it is preferred to have a dust (e.g. fine dry particulate matter) level that results in a safe, comfortable human environment during transferal of the premix. In this invention it is desired to reduce the levels of, in particular, Semduramicin dust. It is preferred to reduce the levels of Semduramicin dust to less than or equal to about 100 micrograms per membrane and especially preferred to reduce the levels of Semduramicin dust to less than or equal to about 25 micrograms per membrane. These levels are measured according to a standard dustiness test described below (prior to the Example section). Any oil may be used that is effective in achieving the desired dust levels and does not deleteriously effect other desired premix characteristics. Exemplary oils are petroleum oils (e.g. mineral oils) and plant oils. In particular plant oils such as babassu oil, canola oil, castor oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, neem oil, niger-seed oil, oiticica oil, olive oil, palm oil, palm-kernel oil, peanut oil, perilla oil, poppy-seed oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower-seed oil, tung oil and wheat-germ oil may be used. Preferably mineral, soybean or rapeseed oil is used. Preferably a mineral oil having a density between about 0.7 grams per milliliter (g/ml) and about 1.0 g/ml is used. It is preferred that a low density mineral oil is used when sodium carbonate is used as either the bulking agent or the stabilizer because this improves flowability. By low density is meant from about 0.7 g/ml to about 0.87 g/ml. It is also preferred that a high density mineral oil is used when limestone is used as a bulking agent because this improves flowability. By high density is meant greater than about 0.87 g/ml to less than or equal to about 1 g/ml. Preferably about 2% to about 10% oil is used because below about 2% oil the level of dust may be undesirable and above about 10% oil the flowability may be adversely effected (e.g. an undesirable amount of glidant (described below) may be necessary). It is especially preferred that about 5% to about 6.5% oil is used. An amount of glidant effective to achieve the desired flowability, (greater than or equal to about 0.12 pounds per second per square inch), is added to the premix. This flowability level is determined according to a simple standard test described just prior to the Examples. Exemplary glidants are sodium aluminosilicate and silicon dioxide; however sodium aluminosilicate is preferred as it provides better flowability. A preferred form of silicon dioxide is colloidal silicon dioxide, which is submicroscopic fumed silica. It is light, non-gritty amorphous powder. A preferred form of sodium aluminosilicate is a hydrate having a particle size less than about 150 micron. Preferably about 0.25% to about 5% glidant is used as below about 0.25% the flowability may not be sufficient and about 5% no additional advantage is gained, although more could be used without deleterious effect. It is especially preferred that about 2% to about 3% glidant is used. In addition, it is preferred that if about 0.25% to about 2% glidant is used, that less than about 6.5% oil is used because that provides a better flow rate. Some of the above ingredients inherently serve dual functions. Some components can function as a stabilizer and bulking agent (e.g. sodium carbonate). In the above description if a particular ingredient inherently performs more than one function the percentages are effected in the following manner. For a multi-use component, its percent in the formulation is added to each specific use, when totaling a percentage of a specific ingredient category. For example, if sodium carbonate is used at a 20% level, 20% would be considered as part.of the total amount of stabilizer required and 20% would also be considered as contributing toward the total amount of bulking agent required. The premixes of this invention may be made by any procedure that provides a premix having the desired properties of flow, bulk density, efficacy, stability, dust control and non-caking. However typically the solid ingredients (except for glidant) are mixed together and then the oil and glidant are mixed in, in succession. It is preferred that the glidant is added last as this facilitates the desired flowability described above. It is especially preferred that the carrier, bulking agent, and stabilizer are mixed together with one-half of the oil. The drug is then added, followed by the remainder of the oil and the glidant. Typically these premixes are added to feed which is then feed to the animals requiring the Semduramicin. In general about 0.5 to about 2 lb. of premix is used for 1 ton of feed. Preferably about 1 lb. of premix is used for 1 ton of feed. The feeds used are those which are useful for the animals that Semduramicin is an effective antibacterial or growth stimulating agent (e.g. swine, chickens). Flowability levels as described herein are determined by reference to a standard test. The test comprises the flow of the premix through a funnel. The data measured in terms of pounds per seconds per square inches. The funnel used was constructed from stainless steel and had no welds or obstructions in the funnel path. The interior of the funnel was polished to a smooth finish. The funnel comprised a cylindrical portion 2.5 inches in diameter six inches long. The cylindrical portion converged over a distance of 2.25 inches to an interior diameter of 0.6 inch. A cylindrical portion having a diameter of 0.6 inch extended from the converging funnel portion for a distance of 1 inch. The flowability test procedure follows. A sample of premix was placed into the metal funnel described above while keeping the bottom end closed using a dry finger. Using a stopwatch, the time required for the premix to completely flow through the funnel was measured. The stopwatch was started simultaneously with the removal of the finger from the funnel&#39;s bottom. The stopwatch was stopped when the powder flow from the funnel was completed. The density (unpacked) was determined by flowing the premix into a graduated cylinder using the above funnel. The premix&#39;s volume was read from the graduated cylinder. Dustiness levels as described herein are determined by reference to a standard test. The dust is generated from the premix sample to be tested in a commercially available dust testing equipment (Heubach Dustmeter available from Heubach Engineering GmbH located in Germany). The generated dust was transported onto a filter membrane via an air stream. The content of active ingredient in the dust collected on the membrane was determined quantitatively by a suitable method. In brief the dust test apparatus comprised a rotating drum, of about two liters volume, into which the premix was placed. The rotating drum, at the downstream end, was in fluid communication with the bottom of a 1000 ml flask via a connection pipe approximately 9 inches long which fed through a hole in the bottom of the flask. The top of the flask was in fluid communication with a filter box of 17 cm 2 surface area. A suitable vacuum pump was connected to the upstream end-of the filter box. The dustiness test procedure follows. The premix sample was placed in the dust generating drum. The vacuum air flow rate was set at 4 liters/minute. The rotating drum was set for 30 revolutions per minute and the drum motor and vacuum pump were turned on for 5 minutes. After five minutes the test apparatus was automatically turned off. The filter membrane was removed from the filter holder and the drug was dissolved and assayed. Examples 1-9 detail data that shows the premix invention has satisfactory flowability and dustiness levels (according to the above described parameters). Examples 10-18 illustrate other premixes that did not have satisfactory levels of flowability and dustiness. EXAMPLE 1 A batch of medicated animal feed premix was prepared using the procedure described below. The proportions of drug and excipients used for this batch are: Semduramicin Sodium 5.64% Rice Hulls 48.86% Limestone (calcium carbonate) 33.0% Sodium Carbonate 4.0% High Viscosity Mineral Oil 6.5% Sodium Aluminosilicate 2.0% Manufacturing Procedure. The Procedure used for making the batches is as follows: 1. The CARRIER (rice hulls) was placed into a 2-liter beaker. The OIL was slowly added to the carrier in the beaker (using low pressure spray bottle). The carrier and oil were thoroughly mixed using a mechanical mixer (WAB model Turbula) for 10 minutes. 2. The BULKING AGENT (limestone), STABILIZER (sodium carbonate) and DRUG were added to the contents in the beaker from Step 1. The bulking agent, stabilizer, and drug were thoroughly mixed with the carrier and oil from Step 1 using a mechanical mixer (WAB model Turbula) for 15 minutes. 3. The GLIDANT was added to the mixture of carrier, oil, bulking agent, stabilizer, and drug from Step 2. This mixture, now containing all drug and excipients, was thoroughly mixed using a mechanical mixer (WAB model Turbula) for 10 minutes. 4. The completed medicated animal feed premix was placed into an appropriately sized bottle labeled with formulation and lot numbers. The flowability of the premix was determined using the funnel test (described elsewhere in this document).

  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/922,139 filed Jun. 19, 2013 entitled Implants And Procedures For Treatment Of Pelvic Floor Disorders, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/936,063 filed Nov. 6, 2007 entitled Implants And Procedures For Treatment Of Pelvic Floor Disorders, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/864,521 filed Nov. 6, 2006 entitled Implant And Procedure For Treatment Of Pelvic Floor Disorders, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pelvic floor disorders are a class of abnormalities that affect the pelvic region of patients, and they afflict millions of men and women. In women, for example, the pelvic region includes various anatomical structures such as the uterus, the rectum, the bladder, and the vagina. These anatomical structures are supported and held in place by a complex collection of tissues, such as muscles and ligaments. When these tissues are damaged, stretched, or otherwise weakened, the anatomical structures of the pelvic region shift and in some cases protrude into other anatomical structures. For example, when the tissues between the bladder and the vagina weaken, the bladder may shift and protrude into the vagina, causing a pelvic floor disorder known as cystocele. Other pelvic floor disorders include vaginal prolapse, vaginal hernia, rectocele, enterocele, uterocele, and/or urethrocele. Pelvic floor disorders often cause or exacerbate urinary incontinence (UI). One type of UI, called stress urinary incontinence (SUI), effects primarily women and is often caused by two conditions\u2014intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) and hypermobility. These conditions may occur independently or in combination. In ISD, the urinary sphincter valve, located within the urethra, fails to close (or \u201ccoapt\u201d) properly, causing urine to leak out of the urethra during stressful activity. In hypermobility, the pelvic floor is distended, weakened, or damaged. When the afflicted woman sneezes, coughs, or otherwise strains the pelvic region, the bladderneck and proximal urethra rotate and descend. As a result, the urethra does not close with sufficient response time, and urine leaks through the urethra. UI and pelvic floor disorders, which are usually accompanied by significant pain and discomfort, are often treated by implanting a supportive sling or mesh in or near the pelvic floor region to support the fallen or shifted anatomical structures or more generally, to strengthen the pelvic region by promoting tissue in-growth. Often, treatments of stress incontinence are made without treating the pelvic floor disorders at all, potentially leading to an early recurrence of the stress incontinence. Existing systems, methods, and kits for treatment typically apply delivery devices to position a supportive surgical implant into a desired position in the pelvic region. However, some of these systems and methods require a medical operator to create multiple incisions and deliver the implant using complex procedures. Moreover, many existing surgical implants are not suitably sized or shaped to properly fit within a patient and treat pelvic floor disorders. Accordingly, medical operators and patients need improved systems, methods, and surgical kits for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders and/or urinary incontinence. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides improved methods and devices for supporting pelvic organs in the treatment of conditions such as incontinence and various pelvic floor disorders including but not limited to cystocele, enterocele and rectocele. Devices of the present invention include implants having soft, flexible support bodies and anchor arms that are sturdy and durable. Other devices of the present invention include introducers that allow an implant to be deeply implanted so as not to cause damage to the pelvic floor and to preserve the natural length of the vagina. Methods of the present invention include the use of multiple implants for treating multiple disorders, including treating pelvic floor disorders and incontinence.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Devices Anterior Compartment Implant Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown an embodiment of an anterior compartment implant 10 of the present invention that provides both anchoring and support to the bulbar urethral complex of a male patient or the bladder and the vagina including the apex of the vagina of a female patient. The implant 10 generally includes a body 12 that has a first end 14 and a second end 16 opposite the first end 14. Preferably, the body 12 is a flat panel formed of a mesh material that extends to side extents 18 and 20. The implant 10 also includes arm portions 22 that extend outwardly from the body 12 on either side of the side extents 18 and 20. The side extents 18 and 20 can extend out laterally to the arms 24 , 26 , and 28. The arm portions of the implant 10 of FIG. 1 collectively include a plurality of arms that can be divided by function into three pairs: first pair 24 , second pair 26 and third pair 28. Preferably, the arm portions 22 are cut from flat panels formed of a mesh material. The arm portions 22 may be formed separately from the body 12 and then attached thereto using sutures, adhesive, heat treatment or a variety of other techniques. Preferably, however, the arm portions 22 are formed in conjunction with the body 12 (hereinafter \u201cunibody construction\u201d) such that subsequent attachment is not necessary and risks associated with attached arm portions (separation, frayed edges, ridges, etc.) are eliminated. More preferably, the meshwork of the implant 10 has more than one zone, each zone having the ability to be constructed of a different filament diameter, stitch pattern, mesh density, or any combination of the three, such that the body 12 is macroporous, supple, and flexible, while the mesh of the arm portions 22 is more supportive while also macroporous. In a most preferred embodiment, the multiple zone concept is incorporated into the unibody construction concept. For example, one preferred embodiment includes a mesh body panel 12 that is formed by knitting filaments having a diameter of approximately 3 mils into a relatively open, porous pattern. The arm portions 22 are formed by knitting filaments having a diameter of approximately 6.5 mils in a pattern that is tighter than the pattern used in knitting the body 12. Other size filaments are also within the scope of the invention, the nature of the invention being that the body panel 12 has smaller diameter filaments as compared to arm portions 22. The arm portions 22 are knitted together with the body 12 such that the implant 10 has a unibody construction. Because the body 12 is constructed of mesh, the shape of the body 12 is easily modifiable by simply cutting the body 12 to a desired shape. Hence, if a patient is smaller than average, the body 12 may be reduced, for instance, by trimming the first end 14 and/or the second end 16. In order to provide confidence that an appropriate size is attained prior to surgery, templates may be provided based on certain patient size criteria, that allows the body 12 to be trimmed to a corresponding size. For example, a template for a patient having a certain height or weight may be used to approximate a size and shape for a desired implant body 12 that should correspond to the patient anatomy. Other patient criteria, such as pelvic bone width, may be used as an entering argument for template selection. The three pairs of arms 24 , 26 and 28 of the implant 10 make the implant 10 ideally suited as an anterior compartment implant and provide apical support. Each arm preferably includes a suture (e.g., string, cord, line, wire, rope, metal, etc.) loop 25 at its end for attachment to an introducer. The first pair of arms are generally flush with the first end 14 of the body 12 and extend directly out therefrom. The second arms 26 are adjacent, and generally parallel to the first arms 24. In place, the first and second pairs of arms 24 and 26 are routed through the obturator fossa and up into the dermis where they are anchored. The third arms 28 are adjacent to and extend at an angle 30 to the second arms 26. The third pair of arms 28 are designed for passage through the ischiorectal fossa for apical suspension and the angle 30 is chosen for anatomical placement without folds. Alternatively, the arms 28 can be trimmed for attachment to the sacrospinous ligament for apical suspension. The angle 30 is preferably a non-zero angle, is more preferably between 30 and 60 degrees and is shown as being approximately 45 degrees. The arms 24 , 26 and 28 are all relatively slender and long. The width of the arms is sufficient to provide structural support, yet thin enough to pass through tissue without undue effort. The widths of arms 24 , 26 and 28 are preferably between 0.1 and 2 cm, more preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 cm and even more preferably approximately 1 cm. In the embodiment of implant 10 shown in FIG. 1 , the arms 24 , 26 and 28 have a preferred width of 1.1 cm. The length of the arms 24 , 26 and 28 are long enough to pass through the incisions and out of the body. As they are trimmed in a final step of the implantation, the length needs simply be long enough to allow ease of installation. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , the arms 24 , 26 and 28 are each longer than 15 cm, closer to 19 cm, and have 5 cm long tapered ends to aid in installation. Sleeves 32 , such as the one shown in FIG. 2 , that are sized to fit over the arms 24 , 26 and 28 and constructed of a smooth, slippery material, may be applied over the arms 24 , 26 and 28 to further assist in passing the arms through tissue incisions and help reduce the spread of any infection from one part of a patient to another. These sleeves are then removed after the arms have been passed through the tissue such that tissue ingrowth may occur. Posterior Compartment Implant Referring to FIG. 3 there is shown an embodiment of a posterior compartment implant 40 of the present invention that provides both anchoring and support to the pelvic structures of a male patient or the rectum, perineum, vagina and the apex of the vagina of a female patient. The implant 40 generally includes a body 42 that has a first end 44 and a second end 46 opposite the first end 44. Preferably, the body 42 is a flat panel formed of a mesh material that extends to side extents 48 and 50. The implant 40 also includes arm portions 52 that extend outwardly from the body 42 on either side of the side extents 48 and 50. The side extents 48 and 50 can extend out laterally to the arms 54 and 56. The arm portions 52 of the implant 40 of FIG. 3 collectively include a plurality of arms that can be divided by function into two pairs: first pair 54 and a second pair 56. Preferably, the arm portions 52 are cut from flat panels formed of a mesh material. The arm portions 52 may be formed separately from the body 42 and then attached thereto using sutures, adhesive, heat treatment or a variety of other techniques. Preferably, however, the arm portions 52 and the body 42 are of unibody construction such that subsequent attachment is not necessary and risks associated with attached arm portions (separation, frayed edges, ridges, etc.) are eliminated. More preferably, the meshwork of the implant 40 has more than one zone, each zone having the ability of being constructed of a different filament diameter, stitch pattern, mesh density, or a combination of all three, such that the body 42 is macroporous, supple, and flexible, while the mesh of the arm portions 52 is more supportive while also macroporous. In a most preferred embodiment, the multiple zone concept is incorporated into the unibody construction concept. For example, one preferred embodiment includes a mesh body panel 42 that is formed by knitting filaments having a diameter of approximately 3 mils into a relatively open, porous pattern. The arm portions 52 are formed by knitting filaments having a diameter of approximately 6.5 mils in a pattern that is tighter than the pattern used in knitting the body 42. Other size filaments are also within the scope of the invention, the nature of the invention being that the body panel 42 has smaller diameter filaments as compared to arm portions 52. The arm portions 52 are knitted together with the body 42 such that the implant 40 has a unibody construction. Because the body 42 is constructed of a flat mesh, the shape of the body 42 is easily modifiable by simply cutting the body 42 to a desired shape. Hence, if a patient is smaller than average, the body 42 may be reduced, for instance, by trimming the first end 44 and/or the second end 46. In order to provide confidence that an appropriate size is attained prior to surgery, templates may be provided based on certain patient size criteria, that allows the body 42 to be trimmed to a corresponding size. For example, a template for a patient having a certain height or weight may be used to approximate a size and shape for a desired implant body 42 that should correspond to the patient anatomy. Other patient criteria, such as pelvic bone width, may be used as an entering argument for template selection. The two pairs of arms 54 and 56 of the implant 40 make the implant 40 ideally suited as an posterior compartment implant. Each arm preferably includes a sutured (e.g., string, cord, line, wire, rope, metal, etc.) loop 55 at its end for attachment to an introducer. The first pair of arms are generally flush with the first end 44 of the body 42 and extend directly out therefrom. In place, the first arms 54 are routed through the ischiorectal fossa and up into the dermis and exit via pararectal incisions where they are anchored, with the first end 44 sutured to the apex of the vagina to provide apical support. The second arms 56 extend at an angle 60 to the first arms 54. The second arms 56 are designed to anchor the implant to the perineum and pass through pararectal incisions and the angle 60 is chosen for anatomical placement without folds. The angle 60 is preferably a non-zero angle, is more preferably between 30 and 90 degrees and is shown as being approximately 75 degrees. The arms 54 and 56 are all relatively slender and long. The width of the arms is sufficient to provide structural support, yet thin enough to pass through tissue without undue effort. The widths of arms 54 and 56 are preferably between 0.1 and 2 cm, more preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 cm and even more preferably approximately 1 cm. In the embodiment of implant 10 shown in FIG. 3 , the arms 54 and 56 have a preferred width of 1.1 cm. The length of the arms 54 and 56 are long enough to pass through the incisions and out of the body. As they are trimmed in a final step of the implantation, the length needs simply be long enough to allow ease of installation. In the embodiment of FIG. 3 , the arms 54 and 56 are each longer than 10 cm, with the first arms 54 closer to 19 cm and the second arms 56 closer to 15 cm. The arms 54 and 56 may have tapered ends to aid in installation. Sleeves 32 , such as the one shown in FIG. 2 , that are sized to fit over the arms 54 and 56 and constructed of a smooth, slippery material, may be applied over the arms 54 and 56 to further assist in passing the arms through tissue incisions and help reduce the spread of any infection from one part of a patient to another. These sleeves are then removed after the arms have been passed through the tissue such that tissue ingrowth may occur.

This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/021,482, entitled \u201cINTERVERTEBRAL SPACER, filed Sep. 9, 2013, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/496,824, entitled \u201cINTERVERTEBRAL SPACER,\u201d filed Jul. 2, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,529,627, issued Sep. 10, 2013. The contents of the above referenced applications are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention relates to spinal implants for intervertebral body fusion devices and an instrument for properly inserting the implant between the vertebral bodies. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] The spine is a complex structure capable of performing a broad range of kinematic functions. The spinal vertebrae and elastic disk permit the spine to move in three axes of motion. These axes include rotation, such as twisting of the upper back and shoulders relative to the pelvis, horizontal movement, such as forward (anterior) or backward (posterior), and lateral bending movement to either the right or left side. [0004] The spacing between adjacent vertebrae is maintained by a disc having both elastic and compressible characteristics. The appropriate spacing in a healthy spine is maintained between adjacent vertebrae during the rotational, horizontal and lateral movement of the spine, thereby allowing for maximum freedom of motion of the spine. The spacing between adjacent vertebrae is also critical to allow the nerves radiating from the spine to extend outwards without being pinched or compressed by the surrounding vertebrae. [0005] Spinal discs can be damaged by physical injury, disease, genetic disposition, and aging, and become less than fully functional. When this happens, the disc is incapable of maintaining the proper intervertebral spacing and, as a result the nerves radiating from the spine can be compressed. Nerve damage could also be caused by root compression in neural foramen, compression of the passing nerve, and an enervated annulus which occurs when the nerves flow into a cracked annulus that results in pain each time the disc is compressed. Obviously other organic abnormalities can occur in the presence of a dysfunctional disc. [0006] Many solutions have been developed to eliminate or at least minimize nerve compression and the attendant pain that commonly results from spinal nerve pressure. These solutions approach the problem by surgically removing the defective disc and thereafter replacing it with an insert that is subsequently fused to the adjacent discs, thereby maintaining an appropriate distance between adjacent vertebrae. While prior insert solutions have been successful in improving the patient&#39;s condition, it is somewhat problematic for the surgeon to gain the necessary access to the space between the vertebrae without doing harm to adjacent body structures such as the spinal cord, other nerves, and other adjacent body organs. [0007] A surgical solution that utilizes a less invasive technique will result in less trauma and unintended damage to surrounding bone, organ, muscle and nerve tissue while achieving the desired results. The present invention relates to an insert that can be advanced into a prepared space between vertebral bodies by a novel instrument, and, upon reaching the appropriate insertion point, a pivotal motion is imparted to the insert to provide proper placement of the insert. The pivotable insert provides the surgeon with the capability to implant the insert using a nonlinear path. The insertion and placement is achieved in a minimally invasive manner. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART [0008] What is needed, therefore, is an intervertebral insert and delivery instrument that will be minimally invasive. [0009] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0009880 discloses a pivotable interbody spacer system includes an insertion instrument configured to manipulate a pivotable interbody spacer during surgical insertion; wherein the insertion instrument includes means for coupling the interbody spacer and a means for fixing the angular position of the interbody spacer. According to one exemplary method for inserting the interbody spacer in a spinal disc space, the interbody spacer is grasped by the insertion instrument and fixed at a first angular position; the interbody spacer is inserted into the surgical site; the interbody spacer is released from the first angular position; the insertion instrument is pivoted about the coupling such that the interbody spacer is in a second angular position; the angular position of the interbody spacer is fixed in the second angular position; and the insertion process continues until the interbody spacer is positioned in the desired location. [0010] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0221694 discloses a spinal spacer system which includes a handle member and an extension member including a first and a second end, wherein the first end of the extension member is coupled to the handle member. Additionally, a coupling device configured to selectively couple a spacer to the second end of the extension member is disposed on the extension member and includes an angular fixation member configured to fix the spacer in an angular position relative to the handle member. The spinal spacer system also includes an actuator configured to selectively actuate the coupling device and the angular fixation member. [0011] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0140085 discloses a method to insert a spinal implant into a vertebral space, the method including the steps of: grasping the implant with a distal end of an implant insertion tool; holding a proximal end of the implant insertion tool and inserting the implant toward the vertebral space; and manipulating the proximal end to apply a yaw movement to the implant while the implant is attached to the tool and in the vertebral space. Two slideable rods inside sheath 1514 activate rotation of the spacer implant. [0012] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0109005 discloses a system for replacing a natural nuclear disc in an intervertebral space which has a spinal device configured for placement in the intervertebral space. An insertion tool is configured for holding the spinal device while the spinal device is inserted into the intervertebral space. A gripping member of the insertion tool has an end for adjustably holding the spinal device within the intervertebral space. A steering actuator of the insertion tool is operatively connected to the spinal device and configured for pivoting the adjustably held spinal device within the intervertebral space while the steering actuator is controlled remotely from the intervertebral space. [0013] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0208203 discloses instruments and methods for inserting one or more implants to a surgical site in a patient in a surgical procedure, including minimally invasive surgical procedures. The implant is mountable to the instrument in a reduced profile orientation and after insertion is manipulated with the insertion instrument to the desired orientation. [0014] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2008/0065082 discloses instruments and methods for inserting a rasp into an intervertebral space of a spine and using the rasp to decorticate the adjacent vertebra. More particularly, one embodiment provides an instrument that actively changes the angle of the rasp relative to the instrument. The delivery instrument may use a gear portion to articulate the rasp. A second gear on the rasp may mate with a corresponding gear on the instrument. As the instrument gear rotates relative to the instrument, the instrument gear drives the rasp gear, thereby rotating the rasp to decorticate the vertebra. Trial inserts and methods are also provided to determine an appropriate size of a rasp for decortications. [0015] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007/0225726 discloses a method, apparatus, and system provided to place an insert in a space between boney structures. The insert may be rotatably coupled to the delivery instrument. The delivery instrument may comprise a body and an articulating member. The articulating member may slidably interact with the insert to rotate the insert about a pivot point. A first actuator is operatively coupled to the articulating member, such that actuating the first actuator translates the articulating member relative to the body. An engagement member may be coupled to the body and adapted to releasably and rotatably secure the insert to the delivery instrument. The articulating member and the engagement member may be offset from each other in such a manner that when the articulating member engages the insert, the insert rotates relative to the delivery instrument. Alternatively, the insert may be coupled to the delivery instrument via rotatable attachment members. [0016] U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2005/0192671 discloses an artificial disc device for replacing a damaged nucleus. In one form, the device may be inserted in components such that the device may be assembled within and retained by the natural annulus therein. In another form, the device may be inserted into the natural annulus in a collapsed or compressed state or arrangement and then be expanded within and retained by the annulus therein. In a further form, the device may be provided with a releasable connection so that the device may be connected in an insertion configuration, and may be released in an operable configuration. [0017] U.S. Pat. No. 7,976,549 discloses a method and apparatus to place an insert in a space between boney structures. An articulating member slidably interacts with the insert to rotate the insert about a pivot point. [0018] U.S. Pat. No. 8,043,293 discloses a pivotable implant having an inner cavity and a plurality of teeth formed on one end of the implant. An insertion instrument includes a retractable latching mechanism and an internal gear configured to mate with the teeth formed on the implant. [0019] What is lacking in the art is a pivotable expandable implant and associated surgical implant tool. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0020] The instant invention is comprised of a pivotable expandable insert that is positioned in a prepared space between adjacent vertebrae. The insert has an approximately centrally located pivot post and a curved end portion, each configured to cooperatively engage an instrument to advance the insert into an appropriate position. Various components of the instrument are manipulated to achieve the final placement of the insert. The instrument is then disengaged from the insert and removed from the patient. An adjustment screw is then used to engage the expandable insert to splay opposing side surfaces to a distance as required by the installation. [0021] Accordingly, it is an objective of the instant invention to provide a spinal insert that is easily and accurately placed within a prepared space between two vertebrae using a minimally invasive technique. [0022] Still another objective of the invention is to provide an implant that is compact in size for installation and expandable upon insertion, minimizing the stress placed on the body during installation. [0023] It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide a surgical instrument configured to be operatively connected to the implantable insert that can be used by the surgeon to accurately place the insert within the intervertebral space using a minimally invasive technique, and expand the insert upon placement. [0024] It is yet another objective of the instant invention to provide simple and reliable mechanical relationships between the insert and the surgical instrument to provide a minimally invasive approach to implanting a spinal insert. [0025] It is a still further objective of the invention to provide an insert that will stabilize the spine and promote bone growth between adjacent vertebrae such that adjacent vertebrae are fused together. [0026] Yet still another objective of the invention is to provide an insert that reduces the need for maintaining an inventory of different sized implants by providing an implant that is adjustable in size. [0027] Other objectives and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with any accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0051] Referring to FIGS. 1-9 in general, FIG. 1 is a top view of implantable insert 1. Insert 1 is generally arcuate in shape and has a top surface 2 and a bottom surface 4. Connecting top surface 2 and bottom surface 4 is a convex edge 6 on one side and a pair of concave edges 8 A and 8 B on the second, opposite side. The edges have first end portions 10 A and 10 B and second end portions 12 A and 12 B. A first curved portion 14 connects first end portions 10 A and 10 B and a second curved portion 16 connects second end portions 12 A and 12 B. Located on the top surface 2 is a plurality of apertures 18 A. Likewise, bottom surface 4 has a plurality of apertures 18 B. Apertures 18 A and 18 B form a substantially hollow center within the insert 1. The hollow cavity within the insert is used to deliver a bone growth material to fuse the adjacent vertebrae together. The insert 1 is relatively small in overall size while providing both a large surface for support and a large cavity to provide bone growth material. A slotted passageway 20 is formed on the second side surfaces including the entire length of concave surface 8 B and a portion of concave surface 8 A. The slot 20 is also continued through first curved portion 14. Insert 1 also includes a first cylindrical post 22 extending between, and attached to, the top surface 2 and bottom surface 4 at a first end portion of the insert 1. Likewise, a second cylindrical post 24 extends between, and is attached to, the top surface 2 and bottom surface 4 at a second end portion of the insert 1. A third cylindrical post 26 is located approximately midway between the first and second post in a location adjacent to the area where concave surfaces 8 A and 8 B approach one another. [0052] FIG. 2 is a side view of insert 1 showing the pair of concave surfaces 8 A and 8 B, first curved portion 14 and second curved portion 16. Also shown in FIG. 2 is slotted passageway 20 which extends from concave surface 8 A, through concave surface 8 B and continues into first curved portion 14. Also illustrated in FIG. 2 is a first post 22 and third post 26. [0053] FIG. 3 is a bottom view of insert 1 showing bottom surface 4 , convex surface 6 on the first side and the pair of concave edges 8 A and 8 B on the second side, as well as first curved portion 14 and second curved portion 16. Also illustrated in FIG. 3 are apertures 18 B. [0054] FIG. 4 is a side view of insert 1 that showing the alternative side to that shown in FIG. 2 showing the convex surface 6 on the first side as well top surface 2 , bottom surface 4 , first curved portion 14 and second curved portion 16. Also shown in FIG. 4 is a portion of slotted passageway 20. As can best be seen in FIG. 4 the top surface 2 and bottom surface 4 are generally domed shaped with the high points 4 A and 2 A of each dome being located in the area surrounding the areas where the third cylindrical post 26 connects to the top and bottom surfaces respectively. These high points will form contact points with adjacent vertebrae, thereby facilitating pivotal motion of the insert about the third post 26. [0055] FIG. 5 is a perspective view of insert 1 mounted on surgical instrument 30 prior to implantation. The instrument 30 includes a sleeve 32 and an arm 34. The arm 34 is mounted for relative reciprocal longitudinal movement with respect to sleeve 32."

  "negative": "TECHNICAL FIELD Embodiments concern implantable medical devices and their applications. Specifically, embodiments involve implantable medical devices that adapt to increased environmental electromagnetic interference encountered during diagnostic procedures, such as computed tomography (CT) scans. BACKGROUND An implantable medical device of an implantable medical system transfers therapy signals from an external generator to internal electrodes at a targeted therapy site within a patient. Electrical conductors within a protective device body provide an uninterrupted path for the therapy signals. Patients with implantable medical devices might need to undergo CT scans for diagnostic purposes. During the scan, they are exposed to X-ray radiation. While the orientation of the X-ray beam is typically fixed relative to the patient's body during a CT scan, the implanted device may be aligned in various orientations due to patient positioning. SUMMARY Embodiments solve such issues by employing various components within the device that automatically adjust to changes in electromagnetic interference, ensuring the device\u2019s functionality remains consistent irrespective of the device\u2019s orientation in relation to the CT scanner. This involves modifying the conductive path when exposed to certain levels of electromagnetic interference to safeguard the device's integrity and patient safety. The modification induces a variable impedance in the conductive path, allowing the system to adapt and maintain optimal therapeutic signal transmission. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments include implantable medical devices containing components that adapt to interference in signal transmission due to environmental electromagnetic fields, such as those encountered during CT scans. These components may regulate the conductive path to an internal electrode, ensuring dependable device operation regardless of the external electromagnetic environment. For example, a specific mechanical structure within the device may change in the presence of X-ray radiation, altering the device's conductive properties to protect against potential interference. This regulating component can provide consistent therapeutic signal delivery and reduce the chance of signal distortion or loss during diagnostic examinations. Additional descriptions, figures, and manufacturing processes detail the construction and operation of such components within an implantable medical device.\n\n",
  "pos": "TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] Embodiments relate to implantable medical leads and systems. More particularly, embodiments relate to the creation of a high impedance within a conduction path of an implantable medical lead when in the presence of a magnetic field of a given strength that is significantly greater than is present in typical ambient conditions, such as magnetic fields that may be encountered within a bore of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. BACKGROUND [0002] An implantable medical lead of an implantable medical system carries electrical stimulation signals from a pulse generator located at an implantation site of a patient to one or more electrodes at a distal end of the implantable medical lead that are located at a stimulation site of the patient. Electrical conductors within an insulative body of the implantable medical lead provide a conduction path for the electrical stimulation signals to traverse. [0003] Patients having implantable medical systems that include implantable medical leads may have the need to undergo MRI scans. During the MRI scan, the patient is exposed to a relatively large static magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla or more as well as a smaller gradient magnetic field. While the magnetic fields may have a specific and known orientation relative to the scanning bore of the MRI machine and therefore to the body of the patient, it is noteworthy that the implantable medical lead and particularly the distal end within the patient may have any number of orientations relative to the magnetic fields. [0004] Within the MRI, the patient is also exposed to a relatively high power radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic energy in the megahertz frequency range. This RF electromagnetic energy presents a potentially dangerous situation for the patient during the MRI scan. The RF electromagnetic energy may couple to the conductors within the implantable medical lead that provide the conduction path to the electrodes and thereby create relatively high levels of RF electrical current that produces heating of the tissue surrounding the electrodes. This is especially problematic for implantable neurostimulation systems where the electrodes are positioned in highly vulnerable stimulation sites such as within the brain or adjacent to the spinal cord. SUMMARY [0005] Embodiments address issues such as these and others by providing multiple actuators within the lead that are responsive to a magnetic field where each actuator is capable of opening a switch within the conduction path over a particular range of magnetic field orientation. Thus regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field to the lead and the actuators within the lead, the magnetic field causes at least one actuator to open the switch and thereby disconnect the electrode from the remainder of the conduction path on the opposite side of the switch. The open switch creates a low capacitance, high impedance path for any RF energy coupled to the lead conduction path. Including the switch in close proximity to the electrode leaves only an insignificant short conductive path length that remains connected to the electrode. The amount of heating that may be generated at the electrode is thereby reduced to a safer level. [0006] Embodiments provide a method of creating a high impedance within a conduction path of an implantable medical lead. The method involves providing a first actuator that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The method further involves providing a second actuator that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. The method also involves providing at least one switch in series with the conduction path that resides in a closed state and achieves an open state to create the high impedance when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position. [0007] Embodiments provide an implantable medical lead that includes a lead body, a conductor surrounded by the lead body, and an electrode coupled to the distal end of the lead body. The lead further includes a first actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The lead also includes a second actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. Additionally, the lead includes at least one switch within the lead body and in series between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body, the at least one switch residing in a closed state and achieving an open state to create a high impedance between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position. [0008] Embodiments provide a medical system that includes a pulse generator and an implantable medical lead. The lead includes a lead body, a conductor surrounded by the lead body, the conductor being electrically coupled to the pulse generator, and an electrode coupled to the distal end of the lead body. The lead further includes a first actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The lead also includes a second actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. Additionally, the lead includes at least one switch within the lead body and in series between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body, the at least one switch residing in a closed state and achieving an open state to create a high impedance between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position.

[0021] FIG. 13 shows another example of a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch configuration within an implantable medical lead. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0022] Embodiments provide implantable medical systems that have implantable leads containing a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch within the conduction path to an electrode of the lead. In these various embodiments, the switch is magnetic orientation-independent by operating independently of orientation of the magnetic field to a direction of movement of one or more actuators of the switch, although the switch may be more sensitive to certain orientations of the magnetic field than others. According to these embodiments, when the implantable lead is brought into the presence of a significant magnetic field, such as within an MRI machine, the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch is forced into an open state to thereby electrically disconnect the electrode from the remainder of the conduction path and create a high impedance for RF currents. Heating of tissue at the electrode is reduced to a safe level as a result of the conduction path being disconnected from the electrode by the switch. [0023] FIG. 1 shows a typical operating environment for embodiments of the medical lead having the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch. An implantable medical system 100 is implanted within a patient 112 and includes an implantable pulse generator 102 and an implantable medical lead 104 that is coupled to the implantable pulse generator 102. The lead 104 includes a distal end 106 where one or more electrodes 108 , 110 are present. Electrical stimulation signals from the pulse generator 102 are carried by the lead 104 to the electrodes 108 , 110 where the stimulation is delivered to the tissue at the stimulation site within the patient 112. [0024] The distal end 106 of this example is shown in more detail in FIG. 2. Here, it can be seen that the lead 104 has an insulative lead body 202 that contains electrical conductors 204 and 206. The electrical conductors 204 , 206 may be cables or coils. The electrical conductor 204 is electrically connected on a first end to a proximal contact or other electrical connection established with the pulse generator 102. The conductor 204 is electrically connected on the end shown in FIG. 2 to a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 208 which is in turn electrically connected to the electrode 110. The electrical conductor 206 is connected to a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 210 which is in turn connected to the electrode 108. These switches 208 , 210 are also contained within the lead body 202. It will be appreciated that either of the electrodes 108 , 110 may be a most distal electrode or may be located proximal of other distal electrodes that may or may not have switches in the corresponding conduction path. [0025] The positioning of the distal end 106 of the lead 104 may vary from one patient to another. While one patient may have the distal end 106 positioned as shown in FIG. 1 , another patient may have the distal end positioned at a different angle relative to a reference axis of the patient 112. So even though the direction of the magnetic field within an MRI machine may be a known constant, the orientation of the magnetic field of the MRI machine to the distal end 106 of the lead varying from one patient to the next results in the orientation of the switches 208 , 210 relative to the magnetic field of the MRI machine also varying from one patient to the next. Therefore, the switches 208 , 210 are constructed so as to be magnetic orientation-independent. Examples of such a magnetic orientation-independent construction are discussed below. [0026] FIGS. 3 and 4 show one example of the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 208 in more detail. In this example, the switch 208 is shaped as a cylinder to facilitate inclusion within the lead body 104. On one end, a ferromagnetic body 302 is positioned beside another ferromagnetic body 304 with a gap 306 present between to allow the ferromagnetic body 302 to move toward the ferromagnetic body 304. The switch 208 further includes series of non-ferromagnetic bodies 308 separated by ferromagnetic bodies 310. On the end opposite the body 302 is an actuator end 318. The internal details of the switch 208 and the operation of the actuator end 318 are discussed in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 5-8. [0027] This example of the switch 208 also includes a conductor 312 that includes an orthogonal spring loaded portion 314 that spans the actuator end 318. As discussed below, one or more actuators extend from the actuator end 318 during operation of the switch 208 in the presence of a significant magnetic field. However, these one or more actuators should not extend from the actuator end 318 when not in the presence of the magnetic field. The spring loaded portion 314 applies a bias to the actuator end 318 to return the actuators to a start position once removed from the magnetic field and to maintain those actuators in the start position to allow the connectivity to the electrode 110 to be maintained. The bias of the spring loaded portion 314 is chosen to be great enough to overcome any frictional resistance plus resistance from any residual magnetic forces to returning the actuators to the start position while being low enough to be overcome by the force the expected magnetic field of the MRI machine or other concern produces in the actuators. [0028] The conductor 312 and spring loaded portion 314 may also serve as a conductive portion of the switch 208. The conductor 204 of the lead 104 may be electrically connected to the conductor 312. A conductor 205 that extends to the electrode 110 is also connected to an electrical contact 316 mounted on the actuator end 318 of the switch 208. The electrical contact 316 may be electrically isolated from any conductive surfaces of the switch other than the spring loaded portion 314 for instance by being mounted on a non-conductive surface. When the spring loaded portion 314 is holding the actuators in the start position as in FIG. 3 , the spring loaded portion 314 contacts the electrical contact 316 so that a conductive path is completed from the conductor 204 to the conductor 205 so that stimulation signals may proceed to the electrode 110. However, in the presence of a significant magnetic field that produced forces in the actuators of the switch 208 \u2032 to overcome the bias of the spring loaded portion 314 \u2032 as shown in FIG. 4 , the spring loaded portion 314 is disconnected from the electrical contact 316 at the actuator end 318 \u2032 to thereby disconnect the conductor 205 and electrode 110 from the remainder of the conductor 204. This disconnection substantially reduces the heating that occurs at the electrode 110 due to ambient RF electromagnetic energy. [0029] FIG. 5 shows a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the switch 208 which shows actuators 317 , 319 in the starting position where no significant magnetic field is present and where the ends of the actuators 317 , 319 do not extend beyond the actuator end 318 as shown in FIG. 3. The actuator 317 is a pin that is mechanically coupled to the ferromagnetic body 302. The actuator 319 is a cylinder constructed of a series of ferromagnetic bodies separated by non-ferromagnetic bodies, where the ferromagnetic bodies of the actuator 319 are offset from the outer ferromagnetic bodies included in the outer cylinder surrounding the actuator 319. For instance, ferromagnetic body 313 is offset from ferromagnetic body 310 while ferromagnetic body 315 is offset from ferromagnetic body 310 and ferromagnetic body 311 , albeit with ferromagnetic body 315 being closer to ferromagnetic body 311 than to ferromagnetic body 310. Ferromagnetic bodies 310 and 311 are separated by the non-ferromagnetic body 309. In this example, the actuator 317 is positioned coaxially with the actuator 319 by being located within a bore through the actuator 319."

  "negative": "The subject matter of interest pertains to a crop collection system that is tailored for integration into a farming vehicle framework, which operates over terrain alongside rows of cultivated plants bearing fruit supported by trellises distributed at intervals along the rows. Past designs exist, such as one that outlines the use of a vibratory head for gathering olives from trees. This device moves next to the olive trees and consists of a series of prongs extending outwards from a shaft turned by the vibratory head. The shaft completes a full rotation, and the series of prongs brush past the olive trees. In a concept developed for collecting fruits, an adjustable vibration head is outlined, where the head's vibrating action is given by a counterweight system. The vibration from the head is transmitted to a brush with multiple rows of outward prongs on a rotating shaft. This design allows for harvesting tree fruits, such as apples or pears, from branches trained along wires. The prongs divide the branches into two fruit-bearing zones, one on each side, and target the fruits without the need for manual picking. Furthermore, crops on different trellising heights, which vary by geography, are accommodated by the system's adaptability, ensuring effective fruit collection. A comprehensive description of this innovative farming device for picking fruits includes an oscillation creator mounted to a carrier framework where it can pivot, pairings of both fixed and adjustable arms attached to this framework, and a rotational motor which drives the oscillation component for contact with the trees. The detailed illustrations reflect various views of the invented system's components and their relation to the trellising method used for fruit-bearing branches.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] The invention described herein relates to a grape harvesting head and more specifically to a harvesting head supported in a harvester framework, wherein the framework is driven over the ground along extended rows of vines carrying a crop supported by cordons spaced along the extended rows. [0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 4,341,062, Scudder, for a Coffee Harvester, describes an oscillation generating head for use in harvesting coffee beans from coffee bushes. Scudder&#39;s harvester travels alongside the coffee bushes and includes an array of tines extending horizontally from a vertically disposed shaft that is driven in an oscillatory fashion by the oscillation generating head. The oscillating shaft is allowed to rotate through 360\u00b0. The array of tines engages and travels past the coffee bushes. [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 5,355,667, Scott, describes a single head grape and raisin harvester with a single oscillating shaker head that is said to center itself on a row of grape vines engaged by the harvester. The harvester is towed by a tractor and uses the shaker disclosed in the aforementioned Scudder &#39;062 patent. The shaker drives a shaft in an oscillatory manner. A plurality of shaker tines extend radially from the shaft. The shaft is allowed to rotate through 360\u00b0 as the oscillating tines engage and are drawn past a row of grape vines by the tractor. [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,910, Meester et al., also includes disclosure of an oscillating shaker head, wherein the oscillation is provided by an eccentric weight assembly similar to those described in the previously-mentioned &#39;062 and &#39;667 patents. The Neester et al. shaker is adjustable in oscillation amplitude while the apparatus is operating. The oscillation from the head is imparted to a brush having a plurality of rows of radially extending tines. The radially extending tines on the shaft form a shaker brush which is free to rotate through 360\u00b0. [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,521, Orlando et al., discloses a harvester for grapes growing on vines having a force balance assembly imparting oscillation to groups of \u201cbeater rods\u201d or tines that extend from their mounts rearwardly from the harvester. The tines are disposed to disturb the vines in an oscillatory fashion in a substantially horizontal plane. The \u201cbeater rods\u201d are positioned to engage the vines on each side of the vine row. [0008] There is a style of vine training for growing grapes that is referred to as cordon 10 supported. One type of cordon supported training for grape vines is shown in FIG. 2 of the drawings, wherein a \u201cV\u201d shaped cross arm 11 has an upright support post 12 embedded in and extending from a ground surface. A plurality of support wires 13 extend between spaced ones of the \u201cV\u201d shaped supports so that crops, such as grape vines, may be grown and supported along the lengths of the wires 13. The \u201cV\u201d shaped cross arm is called a cordon. FIG. 3 shows an alternate form of support for a vine type plant, wherein the upright post 12 supports a straight cross arm 14. The cross arm 14 is also called a cordon and has a plurality of the wires 13 running along the length of a row of growing vine crop. The wires 13 are supported by spaced cordon assemblies, such as illustrated in FIG. 3. [0009] The cordons divide the vine into two distinct fruiting areas, one on each side of the vine. In many instances, grape crops supported on cordon systems are difficult to harvest mechanically and must therefore be hand picked. Sometimes it is desirable to mechanically harvest crops grown on cordon systems, for example, when the grapes are not of high enough quality to be used for fresh fruit consumption. These grapes are called strippings. Hand harvesting of strippings, or grapes that are left over after hand picking, is not economically feasible. Mechanical harvesting of grapes grown on cordon systems has presented problems for current styles of picking mechanisms, which tend to shake the vine from side to side to effect fruit removal. Additionally, the cordon heights vary from row to row and field to field, which requires that current styles of picking mechanisms must be changed in height above the ground during mechanical picking operations to effectively harvest the fruit. Vineyards grown on cordon systems in rolling hills exhibit distances between the vines and the ground on opposite sides of the vine rows that may vary by up to forty inches. This variation of crop level above the ground in the same cordon supported vine row is the product of a number of circumstances, such as soil tilling, which causes the soil to shift downward on the hillside, creating a \u201cbench\u201d effect as soil is deposited from up the hill down toward the area under vine. In this fashion the downhill side of the vine row may become closer to the ground. Since it is desirable to maintain contact with the cordon on the side of the vine row being harvested, this unpredictable and ever-changing cordon height presents a problem for picking mechanisms which are not adjustable in height over the ground surface. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] The invention herein relates to a crop picking head assembly for mounting in a crop harvester framework that is configured to travel along an extended row of plant foliage for the purpose of dislodging a crop growing along the length of the row. The picking head has an oscillation generating head having an input drive member and an oscillation generating head support frame for mounting the oscillation generating head for providing rotational oscillation in a substantially vertical plane. A pair of fixed length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. A pair of variable length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. Crop contact means is mounted on the oscillation generating head in position to approach the plant foliage from beneath. A drive motor is mounted on the support frame, having a motor output in engagement with the oscillation generating head input drive member, and providing oscillation generating head net rotation that urges the crop contact means into the crop foliage. A stop member is provided on the support frame for limiting the net rotation of the oscillation generating head in the substantially vertical plane. [0011] A crop picking head assembly is configured for mounting in a crop harvester framework that is in turn configured to travel along an extended row of plant foliage supported on cordons for the purpose of dislodging a crop growing along the row. The picking head assembly includes an oscillation generating head having a centrally located input drive member and an oscillation generating head support frame for mounting the oscillation generating head for rotation in a substantially vertical plane. A pair of fixed length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. A pair of variable length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. Crop contact means is mounted on the oscillation generating head in position to approach the cordons from beneath and to contact the cordons during oscillation. A drive motor is mounted on the support frame having a motor output in engagement with the oscillation generating head input drive member and providing oscillation generating head net rotation urging the crop contact means into the crop foliage. Stop means is mounted on the support frame for limiting the net rotation of the oscillation generating head in the substantially vertical plane. [0012] The invention relates to a harvester for crops grown on plant foliage in an extended row and supported on cordons along the row. The harvester includes a harvester framework having a longitudinal centerline. Means is provided for supporting the harvester framework and for contacting and allowing harvester framework movement along the centerline over an underlying surface. Power means is coupled to the means for supporting for moving the harvester framework over the underlying surface. A crop picking head is mounted on the harvester framework on one side of the centerline so that the picking head is positionable on one side of the extended row and below the cordons. The crop picking head includes an oscillation generating head having an input drive member. An oscillation generating head support frame for mounting the oscillation generating head for rotational oscillation in a substantially vertical plane is also provided. A pair of fixed length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. A pair of variable length laterally spaced arms are each mounted to the crop harvester framework at an upper end and are pivotally attached to the support frame at a lower end. Crop contact means is mounted on the oscillation generating head in position to approach the plant foliage from beneath. A drive motor is connected to the power means mounted on the support frame. The drive motor has a motor output in engagement with the oscillation generating head drive member to thereby provide head oscillation as well as net rotation of the oscillation generating head that urges the crop contact means into the crop foliage. Stop means is also provided and mounted on the support frame for limiting the net rotation of the oscillation generating head in the substantially vertical plane.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0025] A harvester framework 16 is shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings, wherein a set of four supporting wheels 17 are attached to the harvester frame. The harvester framework 16 has a longitudinal axis extending in the direction of the arrow 18 in FIG. 1 and also indicating the forward direction of travel for the harvester framework when the wheels 17 are powered by a power source (not shown). A shaker head assembly 19 is shown suspended from an upper portion of the framework 16 and located to the near side in FIG. 1 of the framework longitudinal centerline. [0026] As shown in FIG. 4 , the shaker head assembly 19 is suspended from the harvester framework 16 by two rear fixed length arms 21 and 22 with upper plates 21 a and 22 a attached thereto. The plates 21 a and 22 a have holes 21 b and 22 b respectively therein, that accept fasteners (not shown) to hang the arms 21 and 22 from the framework 16. The lower ends of the fixed length arms 21 and 22 have lower plates 21 c and 22 c attached thereto with aligned holes therein as shown. A shaker head support frame 23 has forward extending arms 23 a and 23 b and a connecting cross arm 23 c. Pivoting supports 23 d and 23 e are attached to the rearward ends of the forward extending arms 23 a and 23 b , respectively, having holes therein in alignment with the holes in the lower plates 21 c and 22 c. The axis 24 seen in FIG. 4 represents rotation axis of the head support frame 23 on the lower ends of the arms 21 and 22. Axis 24 extends through aligned holes in lower plates 21 c and 22 c and pivot supports 23 d and 23 e. The fasteners that extend through the mating holes in 21 c and 23 d and in the mating holes in 22 c and 23 e are left out of FIG. 4 for clarity. When assembled, the head support frame 23 is allowed to pivot rotationally about the axis 24 shown in FIG. 4. [0027] FIG. 4 also shows a pair of front variable length arms 26 and 27 that are laterally spaced in a fashion similar to that for rear support arms 21 and 22. The front arms are hydraulic devices in the preferred embodiment, having a cylinder portion 26 a and 27 a and a piston actuated rod portion 26 b and 27 b , as seen in FIG. 4. Front arm 26 has an upper bracket 26 c attached thereto with a hole 26 d for accepting a fastener to connect the upper end of arm 26 to the framework 16. In like fashion, the front arm 27 has a bracket 27 c attached to the upper end thereof with a hole 27 d for accepting a fastener to attach the upper end of arm 27 to the framework 16. The lower end of piston rod 26 b has a bracket 26 e attached thereto having a hole 26 f therein. A member 28 is attached to the arm 23 a on the head support frame and has a hole therein in registration with the hole 26 f. A fastener is inserted through the hole 26 f and the hole in registration therewith in the member 28 to pivotally attach the lower end of forward variable length arm 26 to the head support frame 23. Thus, pivotal movement between the lower end of arm 26 and head support frame arm 23 a is allowed. In similar fashion, as seen in FIG. 4 , the head support frame arm 23 b has a member 29 attached thereto. The lower end of the piston rod 27 b of arm 27 has a bracket 27 e attached thereto with a hole 27 f therein. The hole 27 f is in registration with a hole in the member 29 , so that a fastener passed through the registered holes will allow pivotal motion between the lower end of the arm 27 and the head support frame arm 23 b. The head support frame is therefore pivotable about an axis 30 relative to the lower ends of support arms 26 and 27. [0028] As also shown in FIG. 4 , there is a flange 31 formed on the end of head support arm 23 a as well as a flange 32 formed on the end of the head support frame arm 23 b. Flange 31 is provided to attach to an outside oscillation generating head bearing 33. Flange 32 is configured to receive an inside oscillation generating head support bearing to be described hereinafter in conjunction with FIG. 10. Also seen in FIG. 4 is a shock absorber 34 which serves as a stop for net rotation of the shaker head 19 as will be hereinafter described. [0029] It should be noted that the picking head assembly 19 is herein described as having the variable length arms positioned toward the front of the picking head assembly relative to the travel of the harvester frame. The fixed length arms may as well be positioned toward the front of the direction of travel and the head would function for the intended purpose. The only requirement for a reversal of the fixed length and variable length arms in the orientation of the picking head 19 is that the array of crop contact means (to be hereinafter described) must be positioned on the inside of the picking head as it is mounted on the harvester frame 16 and that the crop contact means extend upwardly and rearwardly relative to the travel of the harvester framework. [0030] FIG. 5A is a perspective of the crop picking head assembly of the present invention from the outside of the head assembly, with the outside oscillation generating head bearing assembly 33 ( FIG. 4 ) removed from flange 31 for clarity. A known oscillation generating assembly 36 such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,341,062, Scudder, FIG. 16 , is mounted in the outside support bearing 33 for rotation about an axis 37 that is substantially through the center of mass of the oscillation generating head 36. An input shaft for the oscillation generating head 36 is shown at 38 in FIG."

  "negative": "RELATION TO OTHER INVENTIONS [0001] The current proposal is an improvement upon patent number 11/240,940, filed Sep. 29, 2005, which itself improved upon several preceding filings, specifically patent numbers 10/146,706; 09/628,388; 08/926,155; 08/720,756; 08/485,448; 08/200,235; and 08/023,698. SCOPE OF THE INVENTION [0002] This proposal introduces new mixed compounds and systems for administering these compounds to individuals seeking treatment. CONTEXT OF THE INVENTION [0003] Within the ongoing development of treatments for diseases, researchers frequently encounter potent molecules with the drawback of being highly insoluble in aqueous solutions, which hinders their intravenous administration. An example of such a molecule is one previously identified as an effective agent for certain conditions over 25 years ago. Despite efforts over decades, the current standard for managing its aqueous insolubility involves a problematic solvent that demands lengthy infusions and specialized equipment to mitigate certain risks. Although widely adopted due to its efficacy in various conditions and despite ongoing trials to expand its use, this formulation is accompanied by severe adverse effects such as life-threatening hypersensitivity and significant immunosuppression, which necessitates additional medications. These adverse events severely limit the maximum safe dosage, thus hindering the effectiveness of the treatment. [0004] The well-known negative effects of this standard solvent formulation are compounded by its tendency to trap the active molecule inside micelles in the bloodstream, creating issues with dosing and therapeutic outcomes due to decreased cellular availability of the therapeutic compound. [0005] Most importantly, this entrapment phenomenon reduces the molecule's availability at the cellular level, with significant implications for patient outcomes. Consequently, there is a demand for alternative methods that can deliver similar compounds without these limitations. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE INVENTION [0006] New composition strategies have been devised to enable the more efficient administration of water-insoluble therapeutic drugs to individuals who require them. The innovative compounds are designed to deliver higher doses in a shorter time frame, and with fewer negative effects from the carrying medium. BRIEF VISUALIZATION OF THE INVENTION [0007] Several diagrams illustrate the bioavailability comparisons of a known water-insoluble compound when delivered using both standard and novel approaches in a mammalian model. [0008] Descriptions pertain to the distribution of the compound within the bloodstream post-administration as judged by sophisticated mathematical models. [0009] Visual data represent the new formulation's efficacy in targeting specific tissues within the organism. [0010] The depicted information compares the therapeutic responses of various conditions to the older and newer forms of the compound administration. IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION [0011] The invention describes methods for delivering a poorly water-soluble therapeutic compound to a recipient, involving pairing the compound with a suitable, non-micellar carrier, and administering an appropriate quantity. [0012] A variety of therapeutic agents may be utilized in these novel processes, with one particular agent being preferred for current applications. [0013] Cargo agents suitable for these novel processes include any biocompatibility materials, with certain proteins being particularly preferable. [0014] It is advisable to avoid agents that form micelles when solubilizing insoluble compounds in aqueous solutions, as these can hinder therapeutic efficacy. [0015] These innovative combinations of the active ingredient with appropriate carriers may be administered via numerous routes, including but not limited to oral, injected, or inhaled methods. [0016] Additional methods may involve using non-micellar carriers to limit the undesirable retention of the therapeutic compound within the delivery vehicle, thus enhancing bioavailability. [0017] The preferred carriers have minimal affinity for the therapeutic compound compared to the micellar agents, favoring the release of the compound so it may exert its intended effect more effectively. [0018] These methods might include using carriers in aqueous media that do not form micelles, purposefully chosen to improve delivery efficiency. [0019] Some procedures aim to extend the duration of a subject's exposure to the therapeutic compound post-administration. [0020] Other methods could facilitate the compound's movement across cellular barriers post-administration. [0021] This could also include methodologies for enhancing the compound\u2019s penetration into cellular compartments. [0022] The invention further describes compound formulations with suitable carriers, promising increased intracellular compound concentrations compared to traditional counterparts with micellar agents. [0023] Formulations are detailed that, due to non-micellar carriers, assure improved compound availability and prolonged action within cells compared to those including micellar agents. [0024] Additionally, the invention specifies compound formulations that favor the carrier's ability to deliver compounds over extended durations as against short-lived exposure typical with micellar carriers. [0025] Another aspect of the invention relates to formulations where the metabolism of the compound is slower in the absence of micellar components compared to the rate with them. [0026] Additional formulations indicate a longer half-life for the compound with non-micellar carriers versus those with micellar counterparts. [0027] There are also formulations that demonstrate a higher ratio of the compound within red blood cells versus plasma than those with micellar ingredients. [0028] Moreover, the invention provides formulations that indicate a higher concentration of certain therapeutic agents in tumors as opposed to their presence in the bloodstream, compared to micellar-based formulations. [0029] The invention further discusses formulations where the exposure level, quantified by an area under the curve metric, is greater in non-micellar carriers than in micellar ones. [0030] It also includes formulations where higher peaks of compound concentrations within tumor cells are achieved compared to traditional micellar methods. [0031] Some formulations might feature a lower peak of the compound presence in the bloodstream than what's observed with micellar carriers. [0032] Another aspect points out formulations where rapid uptake by tumor cells is seen in comparison to micellar-based methods. [0033] The invention proposes formulations that enhance delivery to various tissues, as opposed to the lesser effectiveness of micellar-based counterparts.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to novel formulations of pharmacologically active agents and methods for the delivery of such agents to subjects in need thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In the quest for next generation therapies to treat cancer, scientist often discover promising compounds only to find that the molecule is highly insoluble in water, and hence impossible to deliver intravenously. Such was the problem with paclitaxel, an extremely effective anti-tumor agent discovered over a quarter century ago by the Nation Cancer Institute. Despite almost 30 years of effort, the only method currently approved to address this problem of water-insolubility of paclitaxel is the use of a toxic solvent (cremophor) to dissolve the drug, and administer this solvent-paclitaxel mixture over many hours using specialized intra-venous tubing sets to prevent the leaching of plasticizers. This solvent-drug mixture, currently marketed in branded and generic forms, has become the most widely used anti-cancer agent as it has shown activity in breast, lung and ovarian cancer and is undergoing multiple clinical trials exploring its application in combination with other drugs for other solid tumors. [0004] The cremophor formulation of paclitaxel is associated with significant side-effects including life-threatening allergic reactions requiring the need for steroid pre-treatment for every patient receiving the drug, and severe infections as a result of lowering of white blood cells requiring the need for expensive blood cell growth factors. Ultimately these toxicities result in dose-limitation of cremophor-based paclitaxel formulations, thus limiting the full potential of the very effective paclitaxel molecule. [0005] While the above toxic side effects of cremophor paclitaxel formulations are well known, it has not been widely recognized by scientists in the field that the presence of cremophor creates a more serious impediment to realizing the maximal potential of paclitaxel by entrapping paclitaxel within the hydrophobic cores of cremophor micelles within microdroplets in the blood-stream. The entrapment effect of cremophor is dependent on cremophor concentration. Thus, increasing the doses of cremophor solutions of paclitaxel can potentially worsen the entrapment by raising the concentration of cremophor, leading to higher toxcities but none of the potential benefits of higher doses of paclitaxel, since much of the active molecule is unavailable to the intra-cellular space, where it is needed to act. [0006] This entrapment of paclitaxel by cremophor has a profound effect on the intra-cellular availability of the active molecule and hence may have significant clinical implications in terms of clinical outcome. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for new formulations for the delivery of substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agents, such as paclitaxel, which do not suffer from the drawbacks of cremophor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0007] In accordance with the present invention, novel formulations have been developed which are much more effective for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs to patients in need thereof than are prior art formulations. Invention formulations are capable of delivering more drug in shorter periods of time, with reduced side effects caused by the pharmaceutical carrier employed for delivery. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES [0008] FIG. 1 collectively compares the plasma kinetics of radiolabelled paclitaxel when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). FIG. 1A indicates plasma radioactivity measured up to 0.5 hours after administration. FIG. 1B indicates plasma radioactivity measured up to 24 hours after administration. Inspection of the figure reveals that 2-5 fold higher levels of paclitaxel are retained in the plasma up to 3 hours after administration when paclitaxel is administered in a cremophor-based formulation (Taxol). Due to the reduced rate of metabolism for ABI-007, plasma levels of paclitaxel are higher after 8 hours when administered in an invention formulation, relative to a cremophor-based formulation. [0009] FIG. 2 compares the partitioning of paclitaxel between red blood cells and plasma when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). Inspection of the figure reveals that the blood/plasma ratio for paclitaxel administered as part of a cremophor-based formulation (Taxol) in the first 3 hours after administration is about 1.5-2, indicating that the majority of paclitaxel is retained in the plasma due to micellar formation with cremophor. In addition, it is seen that paclitaxel in a cremophor-based formulation does not significantly partition into the red blood cells. In contrast, paclitaxel administered as part of an invention formulation readily partitions into the red blood cells. [0010] FIG. 3 summarizes tumor/plasma partitioning kinetics of paclitaxel when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). It is seen that the tumor/plasma ratio of paclitaxel increases significantly over the first 3 hours when as part of an invention formulation, as opposed to a Taxol formulation. [0011] FIG. 4 compares the response of mammary carcinoma in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0012] FIG. 5 compares the response of ovarian carcinoma in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0013] FIG. 6 compares the response of prostate tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0014] FIG. 7 compares the response of colon tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0015] FIG. 8 compares the response of lung tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0016] In accordance with the present invention, there are provided methods for the delivery of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, and administering an effective amount of said combination to said subject. [0017] As readily recognized by those of skill in the art, a wide variety of pharmacologically active agents are contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention. A presently preferred agent contemplated for use herein is paclitaxel. [0018] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention are biocompatible materials such as albumin. [0019] Micelle-forming components which are preferably avoided in the practice of the present invention are surface active materials which are commonly used to assist in solubilizing substantially insoluble compounds in aqueous media, such as, for example, cremophor. [0020] Invention combination of active agent and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be administered in a variety of ways, such as, for example, by oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intramuscular, intracranial, inhalational, topical, transdermal, rectal, or pessary routes of administration, and the like. [0021] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to reduce entrapment of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent in vehicle employed for delivery thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0022] Presently preferred pharmaceutically acceptable carriers contemplated for use herein are those having substantially lower affinity for said agent than does the micelle-forming component. Thus, for example, while cremophor has the benefit of aiding in the solubilization of agent, it has the disadvantage of having a substantial affinity for the agent, so that release of the agent from the carrier becomes a limitation on the bioavailability of the agent. In contrast, carriers contemplated herein, such as, for example, albumin, readily release the active agent to the active site and are thus much more effective for treatment of a variety of conditions. [0023] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to reduce entrapment of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent in vehicle employed for delivery thereof, said method comprising employing pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which are substantially free of micelle-forming components in aqueous media as the vehicle for delivery of said agent. [0024] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to prolong exposure of a subject to a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0025] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to facilitate transport of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent across cell membranes upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0026] In accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to facilitate transport of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent into the cellular compartment upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0027] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher concentration of said agent in the cellular compartment than a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0028] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides increased intra-cellular availability of said agent relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0029] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides prolonged activity of said agent relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0030] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation facilitates delivery of said agent to red blood cells. [0031] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation releases a portion of said agent contained therein to the lipid membrane of a cell. [0032] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides reduced levels of said agent in the bloodstream relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0033] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation delivers said agent to the bloodstream over an extended period of time relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0034] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein the rate of metabolism of said agent in said formulation is reduced relative to the rate of metabolism of said agent in a formulation with a micelle-forming component. [0035] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said agent has a longer half life in said formulation relative to the half life of said agent in a formulation with a micelle-forming component. [0036] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher red blood cell/plasma ratio of said agent than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0037] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher tumor/plasma ratio of said agent than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0038] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein the area under the curve for delivery of said agent to a tumor via said formulation is higher than the area under the curve for delivery of said agent to a tumor via a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0039] In accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher concentration maximum (C max ) for said agent in tumor cells than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0040] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a lower concentration maximum (C max ) for said agent in plasma than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0041] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides more rapid uptake of said agent by tumor cells than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0042] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation enhances delivery of said agent to tissue, relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0043] Tissues contemplated for treatment according to the invention include tumors, peritoneal tissue, bladder tissue, lung tissue, and the like. ABI-007 is a proprietary, cremophor-free, albumin-based paclitaxel nanoparticle, 1/100 th the size of a single red blood cell. Based on several Phase I studies, it has been shown that ABI-007 can be administered rapidly without the need for steroid pre-treatment and without the need for G-CSF at a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/m 2 given every 3 weeks. This is a significantly higher dose than is approved for cremophor-based paclitaxel formulations (Taxol) of 175 Mg/m 2. [0044] In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that ABI-007 acts as a novel biologic nano-transporter for hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel, with the capabilities of rapidly releasing paclitaxel to the cellular compartment and increasing intra-cellular availability of the active drug, where it is needed in order to have its chemo-therapeutic effect. Furthermore, through the use of the red blood cell as a secondary storage vehicle it has been discovered that in addition to the rapid and increased availability of paclitaxel at the intra-cellullar level, by the recruitment of circulating red blood cells, ABI-007 further provides a significant prolonged activity of the parent molecule with sustained in-vivo release. These novel mechanisms for rapid and increased intra-cellular availability of the drug at the tumor site, together with sustained trafficking of the non-metabolized paclitaxel, has potentially significant implications for the clinical outcome in the treatment of solid tumors. Indeed, the pre-clinical and Phase II clinical data presented below supports this notion. [0045] By taking advantage of the differences in binding affinities of albumin and the lipid bi-layer of cell membranes for hydrophobic paclitaxel, the drug-bearing albumin nanoparticle (ABI-007) would rapidly release a portion of its hydrophobic paclitaxel cargo to the lipid membrane of a cell. [0046] In the vascular compartment, the first cell encountered is the red blood cell. In accordance with the present invention, the red blood cell has been found to rapidly compartmentalize the paclitaxel molecule. Since the red blood cell has no nucleus and hence no microtubulin to which the paclitaxel molecule can bind, nor any degradation machinery within its core, this cell serves as an ideal secondary storage vehicle for the active paclitaxel, accounting in part for the prolonged activity of paclitaxel noted with ABI-007."

  "query": "How does the adjustable retention system in ski boots enable both vertical and lateral foot retention without excessive pressure?,",
  "negative": "A ski boot includes an inner shell and a mechanism for securing the foot within the shell, specifically around the area of the metatarsus. The boot employs a specialized retention mechanism that does not rely on a rigid plate or screws, thus avoiding common issues with pressure points and discomfort. It features a unique V-shaped support element that encompasses the top portion of the forefoot, which is designed to mirror the natural contours of this area. This component is paired with an adjustable tensioning system that positions the support element in accordance with the individual's foot shape, ensuring a snug fit that distributes pressure evenly. The innovative design aims to maintain the foot in a stable position for enhanced control and precision without exerting undue vertical force, providing comfort even during extended periods of use. Additional elements may include a quick-release function for effortlessly putting on or removing the boot, as well as other manual adjustment capabilities to cater to different foot anatomies.\n",
  "pos": "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a boot, particularly a ski boot, comprising a rigid shell and an arrangement for retaining the foot nounted on the inside of the shell substantially in the area of the widest part of the foot. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Boots having a shell and a foot retention arrangement at the inside of such shell are known, e.g., from U.S. Pat. No. 3,883,964, German Published Application No. 1,801,920 and French Pat. No. 1,587,642. For example, the ski boots disclosed in French Pat. No. 1,587,642 are provided with one or more straps between the shell and the slipper at the level where the foot joins the ankle, for the purpose of assuring good retention of the foot in the boot. However, this retention is not sufficient, particularly in the upper region, for the purpose of advanced or competitive skiing. To correct this defect, certain boots (see especially those of U.S. Pat. No. 3,883,964) are provided with a rigid plate located between the shell and an interior slipper precisely at the upper region, and applied against the upper part of the slipper by means of a screw accessible from the outside of the shell. Thus, the retention of the foot in the upper region is improved. However, such a rigid plate system presents certain problems, among them the following: (1) The direction of forces applied to the rigid plate between the shell and the slipper is contrained in a vertical plane. The result is either poor lateral retention of the foot, or excess vertical pressure to assure the desirable lateral retention. (2) The screws forcing the rigid plate against the upper portion of the foot are emplaced on the top portion of the boot at the level of the upper in an area of low resistance which must sustain the force of the foot transmitted by the plate, and which is subject to deformation. (3) The applied stresses are transmitted to the rigid plate via the screws which abut against the plate regions in substantially pin-point manner. The considerable restraints which result create the danger that the plate will be deformed and that painful spots will be formed at the upper part of the foot, more particularly during forward flexion which involves a slight deformation of the rigid shell and momentary high pressure on the screws. It is an object of the present invention to provide a boot, particularly a ski boot, comprising a foot retention system which permits both good vertical retention and good lateral retention in the upper portion of the foot, while avoiding excess vertical pressure on the foot. Such an arrangement must not transmit stress to the upper boot, so that deformation of this area of least resistance is avoided, and must distribue the pressure necessary for the good retention of the foot to all or part of the frontal area. To achieve this result, the boot according to the invention comprises a shell and a foot-retention system mounted on the inside of the shell, in the front part of the boot. The latter system in turn comprises a support element, independent of the sole, having a general V-shape, and comprising two side plates extending laterally and upon the top part of the forefoot, corresponding to the shape of the latter at its widest portion, as well as an adjustable means for tightening the support element against the foot, comprising means for displacing the two side plates of the support element and pressing them against the foot while adapting them to the top part of the forefoot, the support element abutting against the rigid shell, preferably laterally. Thus, the foot is tightened against the internal sole of the boot and is laterally retained by the support element acting in the manner of a gripping &#34;V&#34;. The two plates of the support element act in the manner of a gripping &#34;V&#34; upon the top part of the foot while forcing it against the inner sole due to the vertical components of the oblique support forces provided by the said plates of the support element, and retaining it laterally due to the horizontal components of the said oblique support forces. Since the two plates of the support element have an anatomical shape corresponding to that of the top portion of the foot, and since the two plates are adjustable transversely on the foot, the stresses applied by the support element to the foot are suitably distributed over the entire surface of the top of the forefoot. Moreover, the arrangement of the foot retention system in the upper region of the forefoot, at least in the widest area essentially corresponding to the metatarsus, permits the avoidance of painful spots at the articulated points. Thus, the arrangement provides heightened comfort without diminishing the technical efficiency of the ski boot. A further advantage of the foot retaining system according to the present invention resides in the fact that the two plates of the support element act as a gripping &#34;V&#34;, thereby performing a simultaneous foot centering function in the shell along its longitudinal axis. This advantage can be utilized for adapting to an ordinary shoe a foot having an abnormal orientation, whether inwardly or outwardly. Finally, the two plates of the support element are controlled from the exterior of the boot by an adjustable gripping means which permits adjustment of the pressure brought to bear in accordance with the morphology of the skier&#39;s foot and the needs of the skier. Various embodiments of the present invention are possible. Fore example, according to a first modification, the means for moving the two side plates of the support element can comprise means for simultaneously moving, in opposite directions, the two side plates in a direction transverse with respect to the longitudinal axis of the foot. In this case, the two plates are mounted for transverse movement with respect to the shell, and are independent. The means for simultaneously moving the two side plates of the support element transversely in opposite directions consist of (a) a threaded hole, respectively, in each of the two lateral plates of the support element; (b) a screw transversely mounted on the rigid shell, movably rotatable about its axis and comprising two parts with reverse threading, each screwed into the two threaded holes; and (c) a control member accessible from the exterior of the rigid shell for turning the screw, the control member preferably also functioning as a stop for the screw. The means for tranversely moving the two side plates of the support element in opposite directions can also comprise (d) two pressure elements movably mounted transversely with respect to the rigid shell and respectively abutting an inclined ramp integral with the lateral plate corresponding to the support member; and (e) means for actuating the two pressure elements from the exterior for transverse translation movement in opposite directions. According to a second embodiment, the means for transversely moving the two lateral plates of the support element can also comprise means for moving each lateral plate of the support element in a direction substantially orthogonal to the lateral surface corresponding to the upper part of the foot. The means for moving each lateral plate of the support element, in a direction substantially orthogonal to the corresponding lateral surface of the upper part of the foot, comprise, in the second embodiment, (a) two pressure elements movably mounted transversely with respect to the rigid shell and respectively abutting an inclined ramp integral with the lateral plate corresponding to the support member; and (b) means for actuating the two pressure elements from the exterior for transverse translation movement in opposite directions. The two plates of the support element are preferably connected in a flexible manner with respect to a transverse direction, in such a way as to allow the support element to adapt its shape as closely as possible to the anatomy of the foot. In both the first and second embodiments, the means for actuating the two pressure elements from the exterior may conveniently comprise (a) two threaded holes each respectively integral with each of the two pressure elements; (b) a screw mounted on the rigid shell, movably rotatable about its axis and comprising two parts with reverse threading, each screwed into the corresponding threaded holes; and (c) an adjustment member accessible from the exterior of the rigid shell for turning the screw, the adjustment member preferably also functioning as a stop for the screw. In respect to the embodiments just described, the tightening means comprises a screw or worm, but a cable system is also possible. For example, it is possible to provide a system of crossed cable stretchers attached to the two portions of the support element. These slide on an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the foot through the action of cables which bring them into contact with the foot, in order to grip and retain the latter in the shell. It is also possible to combine the foot retention system according to the invention with flexible means which automatically separate the two parts of the support element, in order to facilitate loosening of the device. To all these different embodiments, one can add an arrangement for rapid loosening/tightening which makes it possible to discontinue instantly all gripping of the forefoot while yet retaining its original adjustment. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE DRAWINGS A number of embodiments of boots according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment; FIG. 2 is a section of FIG. 1 along line II--II, showing a detail of the first embodiment; FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the embodiment according to FIG. 1, showing the oblique support forces of the support member on the foot; FIGS. 4 and 5 are schematic views of a second embodiment in which the pressure screws are not integral with the support element; FIG. 6 is a schematic view of a third embodiment in which the pressure screws cause vertical movement of the support plates; FIG. 7 is a sectional view showing a detail of a variant of the first embodiment, comprising means for rapid tightening and loosening; and FIGS. 8 and 9 are sectional views showing details of the control member according to the embodiment shown in FIG. 7. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in FIG. 1, a ski boot 1 is provided with a foot retention means 4 according to the invention. It includes a shell 2 which may have several parts and is provided with a means for opening (not shown) and a slipper 3 inside the shell. The foot retention means 4 is disposed between shell 2 and slipper 3 in the area of the forefoot. The support system for the foot retention means comprises two parts 5, 5&#39;, in the form of plates of elastically deformable material and shaped to conform to the anatomy of the top part of the forefoot; a gripping means 6 comprising a threaded rod 7, and a control member 8 which is actuatable from the exterior of the shell. Plates 5, 5&#39; are preferably provided at their upper portions with a compensating strip 9 or 9&#39; which retains the end of each of plates 5, 5&#39;, attached to the end of the foot. This compensating strip 9 or 9&#39; is, by the nature of its profile, more rigid than plate 5. In fact, it is sufficiently separated from the upper part of this plate to act as a single leaf spring, to the point of abutting against the internal wall of shell 2. FIGS. 2 and 3 show in detail the functioning principle of the foot retention system. Arranged between shell 2 and slipper 3, foot retention device 4 is integrated with the shell by one of the ends of threaded rod 7 which passes through an opening 12 provided for this purpose in shell 2. An annular member 11 resting against a shoulder 18 of threading 7b on the inner side of the shell prevents rod 7 from leaving the latter, except for end portion 13 provided, for example, with square driving block 13a fitted into a spherical member 16 acting as a swivel joint, in the instant embodiment. This swivel joint 16 thus prevents rod 7 from being displaced toward the interior of the shell. Ready manipulation of the control means is facilitated by a tongue 17 whose brace 15 acts as pivot axis 14 and as a cotter with respect to the spherical member and the end portion 13 of the rod. It will be seen that the threaded rod is thus connected to the shell, and thence to the entire foot retention system. In effect, the two parts 5, 5&#39; of the support element are each screwed to one of the halves 7a, 7b&#39; of the threaded rod in opposite directions of travel. The screwing of plates 5, 5&#39; is made possible by the insertion of screw nuts 10, 10&#39; in the upper part of said plates. Clearly, these nuts have threading corresponding to the part of the rod on which they are to be screwed. It will be noted that, in the illustrated embodiment under discussion, only one of the ends 13 of the rod is set, with sufficient play, in the shell, causing a certain overhang of the entire foot retention system in the shell, and thus difficulty in putting on the boot. This, however, does not present a problem, because in fact the said foot retention system rests, via the interposed plates of the support element, ont the outer surface of boot 3 which has, despite its pliancy, a certain consistency. It results that the foot retaining system cannot collapse into the shell space, and smooth introduction of the foot into the boot is therefore always feasible. Obviously, it is also possible to provide for setting both ends of the rod in the shell, without departing from the invention. Depending on whether the control means is rotated in one direction or the other, screw nuts 10, 10&#39; and thence plates 5, 5&#39; of the support element are displaced on threaded portions 7a and 7b. In the case in which they move toward one another, they exercise a force F against the foot contained in the slipper. Because of the anatomical shape of the support elements, this force is obliquely directed upon the foot. Its vertical and horizontal components thus assure both vertical and lateral retention of the foot, without there being excess pressure in either of these directions. Moreover, the pliancy of the plates forming the support element facilitates further adaptation to the different morphologie of the individual foot. FIG. 3 shows schematically, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the foot, the make-up of the oblique support forces F and F&#39;, i.e., horizontal forces F H and F&#39; H for lateral retention, and vertical forces F V and F&#39; V for vertical retention, for each of support plates 5, 5&#39; being displaced toward one another during gripping of the forefoot. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate schematically modifications of the foot retention means. In these two embodiments, the pressure nuts 10, 10&#39; which allow the support plates to move in opposite directions are not directly integrated with the latter, but rather are on the exterior and act on guide ramps 19, 19&#39; arranged on the upper part of plates 5, 5&#39;. When threaded rod 7 is turned to effect gripping, nuts 10, 10&#39; move toward one another and come into contact with ramps 19, 19&#39;. The latter are thereby forced toward one another while sliding on the threaded rod, appropriate means 20, 20&#39; being provided on the plates to facilitate this sliding movement. During untightening, the nuts move apart, carrying with them the plates which are loaded by elastic traction means 21, 21&#39; (FIG. 4) or compression means 22 (FIG. 5). FIG. 6 schematically illustrates yet another means of achieving foot retention in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, support plates 23, 23&#39; are interconnected and move in a vertical direction substancially orthogonal to the lateral surface corresponding to the top of the foot. Thus, while the pressure nuts 10, 10&#39;, independent of plates 23, 23&#39;, move transversely in opposite directions, they approach one another while forcing plates 23, 23&#39; downwardly and bringing oblique support forces to bear on the foot via symmetrical ramps 24, 24&#39; which are arranged on the plates and with which the said nuts cooperate. On the other hand, while the pressure nuts 10, 10&#39; separate during untightening, support plates 23, 23&#39; move upwardly, thereby freeing the foot of all contact. The upward movement is caused by resilient means 25, of which one portion is attached to the shell and the other part to the support plates. This resilient means 25 maintains plates 23, 23&#39; in permanent contact with the pressure nuts. Preferably, the latter are flexibly joined with respect to a transverse direction, so as to allow the support element to adapt itself to the maximum extent to the anatomy of the top of the forefoot. It is to be emphasized that the lateral, substancially symmetrical arrangement of the two pressure nuts promotes the adaptation of the support element to the obstacle respresented by the foot. According to a modification of the last-mentioned embodiment, the resilient means can be replaced by an assembly element rigid with the shell. In this case, the pressure nuts, during their displacement, act on the support plates so as to deform them, causing a change in their angle of inclination, and thus, a displacement of the loci of application of the support forces. FIG. 7 shows a foot retention system according to the invention comprising an arrangement for rapid tightening and loosening. The functioning of support plates 5, 5&#39; with respect to the foot is indentical with that described with reference to FIG. 2. The following description is therefore confined to the arrangement for rapid tightening and loosening."

  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 966,793, filed Dec. 5, 1978 now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to a device for determining visual field defects in humans. 2. Description of the Prior Art Blind spot delineation is of unquestioned opthamological value in the diagnosis and management of various disease states. It is a frequent procedure in routine eye examinations as well. Unfortunately, it is a tedious task, which, up to now, has either involved numerous human examiner errors, or complex machinery with many mechanical parts and/or highly sophisticated, expensive data processing equipment. In many existing methods of examination, a hard copy of the test results is either printed in real time on special paper, before it can be determined if the results are worth saving, or is manually drawn by the human examiner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In contrast to the aforementioned devices presently available for blind spot delineation, the apparatus of the present invention is an inexpensive, self-contained, portable, easily modified and expanded device that delineates blind spots via a type of tangent screen static perimetry. Furthermore, it automatically stores the patient&#39;s responses in a solid state memory system that can store as many complete eye examinations as desired, which enables it to repeat exams for subject reliability determinations, conduct both right and left eye examinations, etc. Upon command, the device will display the &#34;blind spots&#34; of any particular test by illuminating all lights that the patient did not see in that test. Different tests can easily be compared, and, if a hard copy is desired, a picture may be taken of the display by an instantly developing camera. Thus, if the examiner believes no new information has been obtained, he does nothing. On subsequent tests, new data will be electronically written over the old.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The foregoing features of the present invention are provided by a device which comprises two main parts. First, there is a tangent screen similar to ones found in almost every opthamologist&#39;s office. It is a board covered with a dark material, such as black felt, generally just slightly over a square meter in area. The device of the present invention modifies this board by placing as many small light emitting diodes (LEDs) as desired at appropriate positions in this board so that individual light sources shine through the surface. In this manner, the same board can be used conventionally by simply covering the LED&#39;s surfaces with another piece of dark material. This material is removed to expose the LEDs when the device is operated. The second major part of the device of the present invention is a control box. It has three cables emanating from it. One plugs into a standard wall socket, another connects with the modified tangent screen, and the third connects to a small push button that the patient presses during the examination when a light becomes visible to him. The control box contains all the electronics for determining which one of all the possible lights is lit, for evaluating whether the patient has responded to that light, for storing that information, for moving on to the next light when the patient has responded or after a predetermined period in which the patient has failed to respond, for signaling when the particular test in progress is completed, and for displaying the appropriate test data on the tangent screen as called for by the examiner. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tangent screen contains 127 LEDs which are, as far as the patient is concerned, randomly presented to him. The test may be repeated with the lights at different levels of brightness, often a useful comparison, by merely adjusting a dial (FIG. 16) which controls the intensity of the LEDs and repeating the test. The device of the invention stores two tests in its one-chip memory, but for nominal expense, this storage capacity can be easily expanded. As many LEDs may be added as desired to further delineate borders of the blind spots, using additional address counters, one of n decoders, and memory. Reference to the figures of drawing illustrates a particular embodiment of the present invention. The control box is seen to be composed of several sections. As shown in FIG. 1, there is a conventional power supply that allows the device to be plugged into any wall socket via lines 10 and 11. Typically, this power supply generates 5 volts at 6 amperes, after regulation, thus supplying all needed power for the TTL logic memory devices and lamps through line 12 and line 13 which is connected to ground 14. The system is orderly run by three system clock circuits. The first system clock consists of two circuits 15 and 16, shown schematically in FIGS. 2 and 4, respectively. Circuit 15 is an astable multivibrator circuit which generates a signal through line 17. This signal is labeled 18 in FIG. 3. The astable multivibrator of circuit 15 is controlled by line 19 from AND gate 20 having input lines 21 and 22 which are connected to the patient&#39;s button circuit and the second system clock as described in detail hereinafter. Circuit 16 is another astable multivibrator circuit which generates a signal through line 23. This signal is labeled 24 in FIG. 5. Circuit 16 additionally contains a switch 25 which either holds the signal 24 in a logical low or allows it to run normally, typically at 3 kHz. As shown in FIG. 6, the first system clock&#39;s output, which is either signal 18 or signal 24, is directed through lines 17 and 23 to circuit 26 which selects either one and directs it through line 27. Circuit 26 comprises a 2-line-to-1-line data selector/multiplexer. Circuit 26 also contains an inverter 28 which inverts signal 27 and directs the inverted signal through line 29. The selection of signals 18 or 24 by circuit 26 is controlled by line 30 from stop write circuit 31, depicted in FIG. 7, as described in detail hereinafter. The second system clock 32, shown in FIG. 8, includes a pulse generator circuit 35, and is provided to reset the address counters 33 shown in FIG. 9, when all the lights have been tested and to switch the device from its write mode to its waiting to read or auto read mode, depending upon the setting of switch 25 in the first system clock. When beginning a test, a reset button 34 is pressed. This puts the device in the write mode and starts it at the first lamp 0.5 seconds after the button is released. While the reset button 34 is held down, a lamp on the control box lights with essentially the same intensity as the other stimulating LEDs. The pulse generator 35 is triggered by a signal from the address counters 33 directed through line 36 and inverted by gate 37 to produce the signal labeled 38 in FIG. 10. Logic gates 39, 41, 42 and 43 allow pulse generator 35 to reset the address counters and stop write circuitry of FIG. 7 in the read mode. These gates also permit the reset button 34 to simultaneously reset the address counters and place the stop write circuitry 31 in the write mode when the reset button is depressed. The third system clock 44, shown in FIG. 11, is an astable multivibrator which generates a 1.0 Hz signal labeled 45 in FIG. 12 which is directed through line 46. This clock flashes the presented stimuli on and off rapidly during the write mode. The clock is not used during the read operation. As shown in FIG. 9, there are two address generators which are simply synchronous four bit counters advanced by the positive going portion of the signal transmitted through line 27 from the selected output, i.e, either signal 18 or signal 24, of the first system clock. The eight bit address generated by the address counters is supplied to a &#34;1 of 128&#34; select logic, FIG. 13, through lines 47-53 and 36. The signal in line 36 is also directed to the second system clock 32. When this signal goes high, that is, when the device attempts to count from 127 to 128, the second system clock pulses through line 40 which resets the counters to zero. Referring again to FIG. 13, the device of the invention uses eight &#34;one of sixteen&#34; data multiplexer chips, 54-61 with simple chip enable logic, gates 62-79. Thus, the data to illuminate one of the 128 lamps is generated. This data is supplied to the write drive circuitry, shown in FIG. 14, through one of 128 lines 80, where it is ANDed with the signal from the third system clock from line 46. In this manner, signal 45 from the third system clock is directed through one of the 128 lines 83, exiting the write drive circuitry. As shown in FIG. 15, the signals on lines 83 are connected to data selectors 84. There are thirty-two data selectors, each connected to four of the lines 83. The output from the data selectors is connected through lines 85 to the 128 LEDs shown in FIG. 16. The stop write signal generated by the circuitry of FIG. 7 is transported by line 30 through buffers 87 to produce signals through lines 86 which control the data selectors 84. Thus, when the device is in the write mode, i.e., when it is testing the patient, one and only one of the LEDs blinks in response to one of the 128 signals transmitted through lines 85. Referring to FIG. 16, all of the anodes of the LEDs are connected to the output of the power supply through line 12 and through rheostat 87. The setting of this rheostat varies the brightness of the LED. Alternately, the anodes may be directly connected to line 12 of the power supply by closing switch 88. LED 135 is illuminated when the reset button is depressed before the test begins to show the examiner the approximate brightness of the stimuli. In conducting a test using the device of the invention, the patient holds a button 89, pictured in FIG. 17, which in conjunction with logic gates 90-93 determines the signal transmitted on line 21. When the button is depressed, the signal on line 21 becomes a logical low. This signal is transmitted into data processing circuitry shown in FIG. 18. The data processing circuitry is comprised of a pulse generator 94, triggered by the rising edge of signal 18 transmitted through line 27, a bistable multivibrator 95, triggered by the falling edge of signal 18, a second bistable multivibrator 96, triggered by the signal on line 21, and a second pulse generator 97 which is triggered by the output of multivibrator 95 transmitted through AND gate 98, arriving through 99. Signal 18 is present on line 27 only when the device is in the write mode as a result of the action of circuit 26 (FIG. 6) as described above. Logic gates 108, 98 and 100 work in conjunction with gates 101 and 102 and data selector 103, depicted in FIG. 19, to insure that data obtained during the test is not replaced by additional, spurious data. During a test, when signal 18 on line 27 goes high, it increments the address counters of circuit 33 (FIG. 9) as previously described and causes pulse generator 94 to output a short negative pulse via line 104. This pulse sets the output lines 105 and 106 of bistable multivibrators 95 and 96 low. If during the high portion of signal 18, the patient depresses the button 89, the signal on line 21 goes low as previously explained in reference to FIG. 17 and sets the signal on line 105 from bistable multivibrator 96 in FIG. 18 high. Obviously, if the patient fails to respond to a light by depressing the button, this signal remains low. On the falling edge of signal 18, the signal on line 106 goes high and if the device is in the write mode this signal appears on line 99 through gate 98. The transition of the signal on line 99 from low to high causes pulse generator 97 to produce a brief negative pulse on line 107. When the device is in the write mode, the logical state of line 105 is transferred to line 109 by action of gates 108 and 100. Referring to FIG. 19, the data on line 109 is stored in a random access memory integrated circuit 125 at the location specified by the address on lines 47-53 and 110. The logical state of line 110 can be made low or high depending on the setting of switch 111 to either ground 14 or output of the power supply 12, respectively. The data on line 109 can be written into memory only when there is a brief negative pulse on line 107 and the signal on line 136 is low. Line 136 is low only when the device is in the write mode as a result of the action of gates 101 and 102 and data selector 103. The operation of the circuits schematically depicted in FIGS. 18 and 19 is graphically shown in FIG. 20. When the test is complete, the second system clock shown in FIG. 8 produces a pulse 38 (FIG. 10) through line 40 in FIG. 7 which causes the signal on line 30 to go low and the signal on line 112 to go high. Besides illuminating LED 114 (which is not one of the 128 test LEDs) via gate 115 and resistor 116, the signals on lines 30 and 112 prevent further writing into memory as explained in connection with FIGS. 18 and 19, supra, and placed the device in its read mode. With the device in the read mode, the signal on line 30 is low in circuit 26 (FIG. 6). This causes signal 24 (FIG. 5) to appear on line 27. This, in turn, causes rapid incrementation of the address counters (FIG. 9) if switch 25 (FIG. 4) is in the appropriate position, labeled auto read. Otherwise, the address counters remain at zero. Referring again to FIG. 19, when in the auto read position, lines 47-53 rapidly repeatedly count in binary from 0 to 127 and are reset to zero by signal 38 through line 40 when the signal on line 36 goes high. During the read operation, the data entered through line 109 in the memory 125 sequentially appears on line 109 according to the address specified by the logical states of lines 47-53 and 110. Circuit 126 depicted in FIG. 21 essentially ANDs the data on line 109, which passes through gates 137 and 138, with the signals from lines 80. Gate 130 insures that the effective AND operation does not occur until the data being read from line 109 is accurate. The resulting output is routed to the circuitry of FIG. 15 through line 120 and appears on lines 85 which causes only those LEDs that the patient failed to respond to during the test to be rapidly illuminated so that they appear to be constantly on. If desired, a photograph of the pattern of illuminated LEDs can be taken to provide a permanent record of the patient&#39;s blindspots. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate the versitility of the device of the present invention. Since only one LED is ever on at a time, varying the brightness of the test objects can be accomplished by varying the value of one resistor. A Cds cell could be configured to help keep the relative stimuli illumination constant even if the room light varies slightly."

  "negative": "In the context of the present disclosure, a novel approach to stimulatory vapor dissemination to neuroepithelial constructs is delineated. However, this new substantive proposition focuses on optimizing the diffusion coefficients for vapor-based stimuli, thereby ensuring a homogenous distribution within an artificial olfactory chamber. The methodology described incorporates a precision-controlled vaporization module that interfaces with a sensor array, capturing electrical potential alterations that stem from synthetic membrane interactions rather than from organic tissue. This setup aims to replicate and explore the biophysical dynamics of olfactory processes in a controlled in vitro environment, excluding direct biological tissue engagement and emphasizing materials science. The described protocol does not entail direct application within nasal structures or leverage specific anatomical features such as the vomeronasal organ. Instead, it underscores the importance of uniform vapor exposure and subsequent telemetry of electrical potentials in fabricated sensor surfaces designed for parity with biological response traits of neuroepithelial fabrics.\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the fields of neurophysiology and to neurophysiological instrumentation. More particularly this invention relates to devices for delivery of stimulatory compounds to neuroepithelial tissue and to electrodes for measuring changes in bioelectric voltage. More particularly the invention relates to a combined neuroepithelial electrode and sample delivery device and to methods of using the device to deliver a stimulant to neuroepithelial tissue and measuring the bioelectric response of the tissue to the stimulant. BACKGROUND ART Electrodes for the study of neurophysiological tissues have been disclosed. Gesteland et al. (Proceedings of the IRE (1959) 47:1856) provides a general review of electrodes and suggests the use of Ag-AgCl electrodes (pg. 1857). Electrodes have been used to study olfactory epithelia and the layer of mucus which overlays this tissue. These studies have provided records interpreted as receptor potentials in response to odorous stimulants. This measurement has been termed an &#34;electro-olfactogram&#34; (EOG). Stimulation and recording of olfactory epithelia in many species have been disclosed. Ag-AgCl, agar-saline electrodes for olfactory measurement are disclosed in Ottoson, D., Acta Physiol. Scand. (1954) 32:384, in rabbits; Gesteland, R. C., et al., J. Physiol. (1965) 181:525, in frogs; Mackay-Sim, A., et al., J. Neurophysiol. (1982) 48:584, in salamanders; and, Thommesen, G., Acta Physiol. Scand. (1982) 115:47, in char. General review of the measurement of electro-olfactograms (EOG) is provided by Takagi, S. F., in Olfaction and Taste, Pfaffmann, ed. (1969) 3:71; Ottoson, D., in Handbook of Sens. Physiol, (1974) 4:95; and, Gesteland, R. C., in Handbook of Sens. Physiol. (1974) 4:132. Devices for the delivery of vapors, particularly to olfactory epithelia, have also been disclosed. These devices, which generally combine a constant air flow with the ability to introduce liquid odorous compounds in order to form a stimulatory vapor, have been termed &#34;olfactometers&#34; (Tucker, D. and T. Shibuya, Cold Spring Harbor Symp Quant. Biol. (1965) 30:207). Vigouroux, M., et al. (J. Neurosci. Methods (1988) 24:57) describe a wide concentration range olfactometer for delivery of short reproducible odor pulses. Plattig, K. H. and G. Kobal (in Food Intake and Chem. Senses, Katsuki, Y., et al. eds. (1977) University Park Press, Baltimore pgs. 51-70) describe a device for olfactory stimulation and recording in humans. Since the delivery of stimulus is external to the nose the device is not precise with regard to the region or type of tissue stimulated. An embodiment of the subject invention relates to the stimulation of a heretofore poorly understood neuroepithelial structure, commonly known as the vomeronasal organ (&#34;VNO&#34;; also known as &#34;Jacobson&#39;s organ&#34;). This organ is located bilaterally in the nostrils of most higher animals--from snakes to humans, and has been associated, inter alia, with pheromone reception in certain species (see generally Muller-Schwarze &amp; Silverstein, Chemical Signals, Plenum Press, New York (1980)). The VNO is a small nasal organ with a central lumen and a pit opening to the nasal cavity. The VNO is a bilateral structure located supra palatial. The pit is approximately 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter and the lumen is approximately 1 to 1.5 cm deep. The lumen is lined with sensory neuroepithelia which constitute a distinct locus of olfactory receptors. The axons of the VNO neuroepithelia synapse with the auxiliary olfactory bulb and the amygdala, both in the brain, and from there, to the hypothalamus. Johnson, A. et al. (J. Otolaryngology (1985) 14:71-79) report evidence for the presence of the vomeronasal organ in most adult humans, but conclude that the organ is probably non-functional. Contravening results which suggest that the VNO is a functional chemosensory receptor are reported by Stensaas, L., et al. (submitted for publication). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment the invention relates to a device for delivering a vapor to neuroepithelial tissue and measuring the neurophysiologic response of the tissue. The device comprises delivery means for continuously providing the vapor to a locus of neuroepithelial tissue; and sensing means for simultaneously measuring neuroepithelial potential of tissue within the locus. In another embodiment this invention relates to a device comprising a electrode for the measurement of bioelectrical potential, and, a delivery catheter for providing the vapor. The delivery catheter is generally coaxial with and surrounding the electrode. In another embodiment of the invention the device additionally comprises an evacuation catheter for removing the vapor from the proximity of the neuroepithelial tissue. The evacuation catheter is generally coaxial with and surrounding the delivery catheter. Another embodiment is a method of delivering a vapor to neuroepithelial tissue within the lumen of a human vomeronasal organ and measuring the neurophysiologic response of the tissue. The method comprises the following steps: providing a device with a delivery means which has an output end and a sensing means which has a recording end; placing the output end and recording end of the device within the lumen of the vomeronasal organ; continuously delivering the vapor within the lumen; and simultaneously recording the bioelectric response. Another embodiment is a method of delivering a vapor containing a stimulant to neuroepithelial tissue of a subject and measuring bioelectric response. The method comprises a first step of providing a device which is an embodiment of the invention, namely, a device comprising an electrode, an amplifying means, a delivery catheter, vapor delivery source, an evacuation catheter, and a suction means. The additional steps of the method are placing the electrode in contact with a neurophysiological tissue, delivering the vapor containing stimulant, recording the bioelectric response and removing the vapor containing stimulant. In another embodiment the delivery, recording and removal are continuous. It is an object of the invention to provide a compact, combined electrode and vapor delivery device which, when coupled to a signal amplifier and recorder, as well as a vapor delivery source, can deliver a stimulatory vapor to a discrete locus of neuroepithelial tissue and record the bioelectric response of a subset of the stimulated locus. In some cases, the stimulated locus is no more than a few millimeters in diameter and the recorded subregion is a smaller area generally central to the stimulated tissue. It is another object of the invention to provide a device which additionally removes the stimulatory vapor such that neither proximal nor distal neuroepithelial tissue is exposed to the vapor. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a device in which the functions, namely delivery, recording and removal are provided continuously. It is another object of the invention to provide a method of delivering a stimulatory vapor to a limited region of a specific neuroepithelial tissue without stimulating distal tissues, and to measure the response of the stimulated region. Particularly, it is an object of the invention to provide a device and method of specifically stimulating and measuring the response of the neuroepithelial tissue of a vomeronasal organ (VNO), most particularly the VNO of a human subject.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The device of the subject invention provides for delivery of a vapor to neuroepithelial tissue and measurement of the change in voltage of the stimulated tissue. Preferably the device will be able to continuously and simultaneously provide a vapor and monitor the response. A vapor is the gaseous state of a substance and also a mixture of a liquid and a gas. A. The Device The principal elements of the device comprise sensing means for measuring electrical potential of neuroepithelium and delivery means for providing a vapor to the neuroepithelium. 1. The Electrode Sensing means for measuring electrical potential is preferably an electrode 10 with a recording end 12 for contacting the target tissue and detecting a voltage, and an amplifier end 13 with a means for attaching the electrode 12 to a signal amplifier 17. The electrode 10 may be made of any conducting metal, preferably silver (Ag), more preferably a chlorided silver (Ag-AgCl). A Ag-AgCl electrode provides a stable voltage baseline and a high signal to noise ratio under physiological conditions. Chloriding the electrode also makes the wire non-polarizable and enables both the reference electrode and recording electrode to be at the same potential during recording. The electrode diameter is at least 0.05 mm, but no more than 0.3 mm, preferably at least about 0.1 mm but no more than about 0.2 mm. The recording end 12 of the wire may be a slightly larger diameter to provide a larger surface for contacting the tissue. This is accomplished for instance by melting the tip in a oxygen-acetylene flame to for a ball about 0.25 mm to about 0.4 mm in diameter. A method for preparing AgCl electrodes is provided infra. The length of the electrode 10 is generally no less than 50 mm and no greater than 150 mm, preferably no less than 75 mm and no greater than 125 mm. A preferred feature of the electrode 10 is an insulating coat 14 which isolates all but 1 to 4 mm of the recording end 12 of the electrode. The insulating coat reduces electrical artifacts and permits measurement of voltage only from the exposed recording end 12. The inner diameter of the insulating coat is such that it fits snuggly around the wire electrode. The outer diameter should be as small as possible to accommodate the electrode, preferably about 0.2 mm to about 0.4 mm. The coat 14 covers the electrode wire from the means for attaching the electrode to the amplifier to near the recording end 12, usually from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm from the recording end 12. The insulating coat 14 may be made of any non-conducting material but is preferably made of polytetrafluorethylene (Teflon). Another preferred feature of the electrode is a gelatin-saline tip 16 which provides an interface for a more conductive contact between the target tissue and the recording end 12 of the electrode. The gelatin-saline tip may be applied as a coating on the recording end of the electrode wire. Alternatively, the insulating coat 14 may extend beyond the end of the electrode forming a mold which is filled with gelatin-saline material thereby providing the gelatin-saline tip 16. The gelatin may be agarose, acrylamide or the like, or any combination of such materials. The saline solvent may be any monovalent physiologic salt such as NaCl or KCl, preferably NaCl, and the gelatin-saline mixture is prepared, as known to those skilled in the art, at generally physiologic salinity. Preferably the gelatin-saline is 4% to 7% agarose, preferably about 6% agarose, in a physiological saline. Preferably the agarose is applied by preparing a melted solution of agarose in saline and dipping the tip of the electrode no more than 3 times into the solution before the agarose can harden on the electrode. The gelatin interface reduces the chance of damaging mucosal tissue and reduces diffusion of metal ions to the cells. 2. The Delivery Catheter Delivery means for providing a vapor to the neuroepithelium is preferably a delivery catheter 20 affixed or tethered in some fashion to the sensing means 10 such that the region of neuroepithelium measured by the sensing means is a subset of the region stimulated by the vapor. The catheter 20 is made of a flexible inert material, preferably Teflon. The outer diameter of the delivery catheter is from 2 times to 6 times larger than the insulating coat 14, or about 0.5 mm to about 2.5 mm. Preferably the outer diameter of the delivery catheter 20 is about 1 mm. The delivery catheter 20 has an output end 22 and an input end 24. The output end 22 is proximal to the recording end 12 of the electrode 10 and does not extend beyond the recording end 12. More preferably, the output end 22 is somewhat recessed from the recording end 12 of the electrode 10 at least 1 mm but no more than 5 mm, preferably at least about 2 mm but no more than about 3 mm. This reduces the possibility that the delivery catheter would interfere with the quality of contact between the electrode and the tissue. The input end 24 is coupled to vapor delivery means 25. Such means are known to those skilled in the art of neurophysiology. The delivery catheter 20 may be immediately adjoining the electrode 10 or preferably, partially or wholly encircling the electrode. For example, the electrode 10 may be affixed along the exterior or interior wall of the delivery catheter 20. The delivery catheter 20 may be distorted to wrap around the electrode 10 creating a C-shaped catheter lumen. In a preferred embodiment, FIG. 1, the delivery catheter 20 and electrode 10 are generally coaxial and the delivery catheter surrounds the electrode from the output end 22 back at least 50 mm but no more than 150 mm, preferably about 75 mm to 125 mm. At this point the electrode 10 exits the delivery catheter 20. The area of exit on the catheter 20 can be sealed by a sealing means such as a contact cement, adhesive and the like. In an embodiment of the invention the device comprising the sensing means 10 and delivery means 20 is intended for use within the lumen of a human VNO. Since the pit of the VNO is no more than about 1 to 2 mm and the depth of the pit about 10 mm, therefore both the recording end 12 of the sensing means 10 and the output end of the delivery means 20 must be able to be accurately inserted into the lumen of the VNO, spatially oriented to each other and to the target tissue as described, and function as described herein. 3. Evacuation Catheter An embodiment of the device additionally comprises evacuation means for removing the vapor from the proximity of the target neuroepithelial tissue. Evacuation means is preferably an evacuation catheter 30 which is affixed or tethered in some fashion to the delivery catheter 20 such that evacuation catheter 30 scavenges vapor provided by the delivery catheter 20 in order to limit the dispersal of the vapor. The evacuation catheter 30 is made of any flexible inert material, preferably Teflon. The evacuation catheter has an scavenging end 32 and an expelling end 34. The scavenging end 32 is proximal to the output end 22 of the delivery catheter 20 and does not extend beyond the output end 22. Preferably, the scavenging end 32 is recessed from output end 22 of the delivery catheter 20 by at least 1 mm but no more than 5 mm, preferably at least about 2 mm but no more than about 3 mm. This reduces the possibility that vapor would stimulate other neuroepithelial tissue, thereby possibly confusing the interpretation of the tissue response, and in addition reduces the possibility of systemic ingestion of the vapor. The evacuation catheter 30 may be immediately adjoining the delivery catheter 20 or preferably, partially or wholly encircling the delivery catheter. In a preferred embodiment, FIGS. 2 and 3, the evacuation catheter 30 and delivery catheter 20 are generally coaxial and the evacuation catheter surrounds the delivery catheter. In a more preferred embodiment, the electrode 10, delivery catheter 20, and evacuation catheter 30 are all generally coaxial. The electrode 10 generally is central; the delivery catheter 20 surrounds the electrode 10 and the output end 22 is recessed from the recording end 12 of the electrode 10; and the evacuation catheter 30 surrounds the delivery catheter 20 with the scavenging end 32 of the evacuation catheter 30 recessed from the /utput end 22 of the delivery catheter 20. The outer diameter of the evacuation tube 30 is preferably at least generally equivalent to and no more than 3 times larger than the outer diameter of the delivery tube 20. In the preferred embodiment wherein the delivery tube 20 evacuation tube 30 are concentric, the outer diameter of the evacuation tube is about 2 times larger than the outer diameter of the delivery tube. In another embodiment of the invention the device comprising sensing means 10, delivery means 20, and evacuation means 30 is intended to stimulate and measure neuroepithelial tissue within the pit of a human VNO. Since the opening of the VNO is no more than about 1 to 2 mm and the depth of the pit about 10 mm, therefore both the recording end 12 of the sensing means 10 and the output end of the delivery means 20 is insertible into the VNO, they can be spatially oriented to each other and to the target tissue as described, and they function as described herein. Furthermore, the scavenging end 32 of the evacuation means 30 can be spatially oriented proximal to and just outside of the opening to the vomeronasal pit such that the vapor delivered by the delivery means 20 within the pit is removed by the evacuation means 30 as it exits the vomeronasal pit. 2. Peripheral Equipment The device of the subject invention is intended to function as a component in combination with several instruments, devices and means known to those skilled in the art and/or readily available from commercial sources. A. Amplifying Means The amplifier end 13 of the sensing means 10 is coupled to amplifying means 17 for enhancing the signal from the neuroepithelial tissue."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to enhancing growth of plants, trees, and/or crops. More specifically, the invention relates to methods of enhancing growth of plants, trees, and crops with Stevia. It is generally known that Stevia contains such very strong sweet substances such as Stevioside and Rebaudioside. In JP62-108790 and 62-108791, the mixture of the pulverized leaves and stalk of the Stevia plant, where the pulverized leaves portion shall be between 10% and 40% by weight and it is strictly required that the particles be no greater than 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter, is disclosed for use in the cultivation of plants. When applied as an additive to the fertilizers, the mixture acts to bring out the natural taste and sweetness, and also improves the taste, flavor, luster, corpulence, and size of fruits and other agricultural products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention hereunder relates to use of the plant tissues of the leaves and stalk of Stevia, which enhance the vital and resistant powers of plants, trees, and crops, and which accelerate the growth of the roots of plants, trees, and crops. It is understood that the term \u201cplants\u201d as used herein, when not referring to a specific plant, is intended to encompass all plantlike, including trees. It has been determined according to the invention that use of Stevia in the form of particles of diameter at least 10 \u03bcm or in the form of a liquid extract of Stevia results in effects neither disclosed by nor obvious from the prior art, which, moreover, does not disclose or make obvious any agricultural use of a liquid extract of Stevia. In further accordance with the invention, particular modes of application of pulverized Stevia of particular diameters much greater than in the prior art and of liquid extracts of Stevia and particular effects resulting from applying these to plants and/or to the soil in which the plants are planted have been determined. The Stevia powder or liquid extract may be applied to the plants and/or to the soil in which the plants are planted. Practically speaking, it is convenient to refer to application of the Stevia powder or extract to the soil. On this basis, for example, applications per unit area are determined. It is to be understood, however, that recitations of application of Stevia particles or liquid extract to the soil are not intended to exclude application of the Stevia particles and/or liquid extract to the plants as well because, of course, the plants are not shielded during application of the Stevia particles or liquid extract. The mixture of the dry and pulverized plant tissues of the leaves and stalk of Stevia has, according to the invention, been found to have the following effects when applied to the soil: (1) It makes the taste of the crops last longer; (2) Even when fertilizer is excessively applied, the plants, trees, and crops absorb only the required quantity of the mixture and grow without any problem; (3) It makes the plants, trees, and crops more resistant to harmful microbes contained in the soil; (4) It accelerates the growth of roots; (5) It proliferates useful microbes contained in the soil; (6) It prevents problems generally associated with repeated cultivation; (7) It prevents fruits from falling off the trees before the harvest. It has been determined, according to the invention, that hot water extract of the finely pulverized powder of the plant tissue of Stevia acts to vitalize plants, trees, and crops when applied even in small quantity to the plants and/or the soil in which the plants are planted and has the same effects as the pulverized Stevia according to the invention. Even though the materials of the invention act to vitalize plants, trees, and crops when they are administered only once to the soil in a small quantity, the materials are more effective when administered two or more times at regular intervals. Compost is a desirable fertilizer and acts to vitalize the land laid to waste by the excessive application of chemical fertilizers. However, the application of 1-20 gram per square meter of compost is not effective at all. The substances of the invention have conspicuous effects even in small quantity; thus, they are not fertilizers but vitality-enhancing materials. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The raw material of the invention, which is referred to herein simply as Stevia, is a perennial composite plant, academically called Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni , with its related plants originally growing in South America. The effective substances are contained in the whole mature body of the plant, especially in the leaves and stalk of the plant before budding occurs. They are also contained in the root and seedling of the plant in one-fifth to one-tenth of that contained in the stalk. To produce the finely pulverized powder of Stevia, the part of Stevia above the soil is cut off and removed from the soil, dried, and pulverized. There is no specific way of drying and pulverizing it. It only should not be dried under rainy or dewy conditions. After separating the leaves and the stalk from one another and cutting the stalk into smaller pieces, the separated portions are separately pulverized. Pulverization after drying is the most effective way of producing the fine powder. The moisture contained within the mixture is preferably less than about, by weight, 12% and more preferably less than about, by weight, 10.5%. The diameter of the particles of the powder is at least 10 \u03bcm and preferably less than about 100 \u03bcm and more preferably less than about 50 \u03bcm. It has been found that the effectiveness of Stevia powder or Stevia extract according to the invention is increased by the addition thereto of an organic acid. Preferred for this purpose are acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, valeric acid and maleic acid. The effective substances of the invention hereunder have not yet been identified. However, it is recognized that hot water extracts of the finely pulverized powder have a very strong antioxidant activity. The quantity to be applied of material according the invention varies with the kind of agricultural products and with the condition of the soil. But generally, about 1-20 grams per square meter, preferably about 2-15 grams per square meter and more preferably about 5-10 grams per square meter are applied at a time. In some instances, an application as light as about 0.2 gram per square meter or as heavy as about 100 grams per square meter or greater may be used. A single application is sufficient to produce the vitalization effects. To make sure the plants, trees and crops receive the effects, multiple spraying may be done before harvest. In cases where plants, trees and crops are young and fragile with the soil being full of harmful microbes or with the soil being damaged by repeated crops, about 12-15 grams per square meter may be sprayed. As will be explained hereinafter, materials according to the invention may be applied in quantities per unit area different from those mentioned hereinabove for particular crops and purposes. Maintaining the hot water extract of the plant tissue of Stevia at room temperature, the extract ferments and emits carbon dioxide. It ferments vigorously at the initial stage and slowly after 3-6 months. It still ferments, though slightly, even after 1 to 5 years. The fermented liquid has the same effects as the pulverized powder of Stevia, such as lengthening the period harvested fruits, vegetables and the like stay fresh, preventing fruits from falling down off the trees, keeping the microbes contained in the soil, preventing damage caused by repeated plantings and harvests, and accelerating the expansion of the roots. The fermented liquid extract will usually be sold in a concentration of about 13-18% by weight solids content. When actually used, that product is to be diluted up to about 300 to 3000 times, by volume, with water and then applied to plants and/or the soil in which they are growing. The amount to be applied may be calculated as volume of the liquid per unit area of the soil to which the liquid is applied, for example, liters per square meter. The calculation may be made, for example, to apply the same amount of solids per unit area as would be applied in the case of pulverized Stevia which has not been made into a liquid extract. While plants have a self-protection mechanism whereby they do not absorb more nutrients than needed, when plants are deficient in physical strength, their growth is obstructed because they excessively absorb nitrogen, especially nitrate nutrients. With the pulverized powder or liquid extract of Stevia added to the fertilizers, the plants can enhance their physical strength and grow more stably without the excessive absorption of nutrients in the soil. Fruit trees that develop so as to bear many fruits, especially citrus fruit trees, get exhausted and cannot expand their roots. The expansion of the roots is proportional to quantity of fruit in future harvests. With the roots expanded, also the taste of the fruit is improved Trees bearing dekopon, a kind of mandarin orange, are poor in root expansion and the harvest therefrom decreases harvest by harvest even if it comes to the point that they bear fruit only every other year. Prior to this invention, there has been no effective way of expanding the roots. The inventors hereunder detected that the Stevia powder or liquid extract expands the roots by application of the powder or liquid extract to the soil. The amount of Stevia to be applied is preferably about 2-15 kg per 1000 square meters. The pulverized powder or liquid extract of the plant tissue of Stevia acts to accelerate the rooting of various plants, including fruit trees. Being applied in small quantity, the effective materials contained in the powder are considered to have some vitality enhancing activity for plants and not to act as a fertilizer. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of a Powder from Stevia Plant A Stevia plant, before budding, is cut off and removed from the surface of the soil. The leaves and stalk are separated after being dried naturally. After the stalk is cut into pieces and dried naturally, the leaves and the stalk pieces are separately pulverized by a pulverizing machine with rotating cutters. Since the leaves and the stalk pieces cannot be pulverized into particles of the desired size by the pulverizing machine, both portions separately undergo a two-step pulverizing process so that particles of 20-30 \u03bcm are obtained. The pulverized powders of the stalk and of the leaves are mixed in a ratio of stalk to leaves of about 8:2 by weight. It is this Stevia powder which is used in the subsequent examples wherever application of Stevia powder is mentioned. Part of the mixture is boiled for 3-8 hours. The hot water extract is condensed to a solids concentration of 16% by weight and placed at room temperature. The extract ferments vigorously initially and emits carbon dioxide. After 5-6 months, the carbon dioxide generated decreases. The fermented extract remaining after one year is the Stevia liquid extract. EXAMPLE 2 Experiment Regarding the Period of Time Harvested Spinach Remains Fresh Spinach seeds are planted in experimental areas A and B (9 square meters each) on September 14. Spinach is harvested on October 15. The same fertilizer is administered to both A and B. Pulverized powder of Stevia is applied to the surface of the soil of area A at a ratio of 5 g per square meter followed by sprinkling the surface of the soil with water on October 1 and 7. Stevia powder is not applied to Area B. The spinach harvested from areas A and B have dark green and lively colors and look identical at first sight. The spinach harvested from areas A and B are separately wrapped in newspapers and stored at a temperature of20\u00b0 C. After 7 days, the spinach from area A is as fresh and as lively in appearance as when first observed, but loses some of its freshness on the 8th day. The spinach from area B stays fresh only for 2 days and loses it on the 3rd day; on the 4th day, there are some withered and brown leaves. EXAMPLE 3 Experiment Regarding the Period of Time Harvested Peaches Remain Fresh A peach orchard (200 square meters) having 14 peach trees is divided into 2 blocks of equal area having 7 peach trees, making one block the experimental area A and the other area B. The same fertilizer is applied to both areas A and B as usual (namely, a mixed fertilizer is administered at a ratio of 10 kg per square meter four times every other month). 10 days before budding occurs on the peach trees, pulverized powder of Stevia is applied over the surface of the soil of area A at a ratio of 10 g per square meter, and then Area A is sprinkled with water. And at the time when the leaves of the peach trees become 3 cm long, the fermented liquid of Stevia described in Example 1 is sprayed on the surface of the soil of Area A at a ratio of a predetermined amount of ml per square meter to result in an application on a solids basis of 10 g per square meter. Neither powder nor liquid of Stevia is applied to area B. The peaches harvested from area A are all ripened and stay fresh for 12-15 days after being harvested, while only some of the peaches harvested from area B are ripened and stay fresh only 2-3 days after being harvested. The unripened peaches from area B are delivered to the market and stay fresh about 2 weeks. Additionally, the peaches from area B turns brown later when pressed by fingers, but those from area A do not turn brown later even when pressed by fingers. EXAMPLE 4 Experiment Regarding the Period of Time Harvested Mandarin Oranges Remain Fresh A mandarin orange orchard (2000 square meters) having 150 mandarin orange trees is divided into 2 blocks of equal area and equal number of trees, one being experimental area A and the other area B. The same fertilizer is administered to both areas A and B (namely, a mixed fertilizer is sprayed at a ratio of 10 kg per 100 square meters four times every other month). Stevia powder is sprayed over the surface of the soil of area A at a ratio of 7 g per square meter on October 6 and 10. No powder is sprayed over area B. The crop from each of areas A and B is 3.5 tons. The crops from areas A and B are placed in respective sets of corrugated cardboard boxes at room temperature in December. A white color mold forms on the crop from area B in February and the crop becomes totally rotten in a white color in early March. The crop from area A does not get moldy even in April, and has a little loss of moisture. EXAMPLE 5 Experiment Regarding Preventing Peaches from Falling off the Trees A peach orchard in which white peaches are cultivated is divided into 2 equal blocks each of 50 square meters, one being experimental area A and the other area B. Before budding takes place on the trees, pulverized powder of Stevia is sprayed in a circle on the soil around each tree in area A at a ratio of 5 g per square meter, totaling 250 g of the powder for area A of the orchard, and then area A is spriked with water. This spraying is repeated when the flowers from the trees start falling down, when the trees begin bearing fruit, and when the fruit becomes 3 cm long. The manner of cultivation of area A is the same as that of area B, except for the spraying of the Stevia powder. The proportion of fruits that fall down is 5.1% in area A and is 17% in area B. The natural falling down of fruits from fruit trees is caused by the self-protection mechanism of the fruit trees. The applied powder of the plant tissue of Stevia acts to increase the vitality of the trees. The effect of preventing the falling down of fruits from fruit trees is conspicuous for pear trees, apple trees, and peach trees. EXAMPLE 6 Experiment Regarding Maintaining or Acquiring a Normal Level of Microbes Living in Soil Seedlings of Japanese black pine are planted on April 5, the seedlings having a height of 40 cm and a diameter at the root of 1 cm. One experimental area is 3.5 meters long and 1 meter wide, being 3.5 square meters, and has about 30 seedlings planted there. There are two other similar experimental areas, with the number of seedlings totaling 85. There are three corresponding control areas having 87 seedlings. 5000 microbes belonging to the group of Shimabara are inoculated per seedling on August 30. 300 g of pulverized Stevia powder is sprayed over the surface of the experimental area, and 5 liters of water per area are sprayed over each area after the inoculation. The height and diameter (the latter at 5 cm above the surface of the soil) of each seedling is measured on June 13 (designated as the start in subsequent tables) and again on November 7 (designated as the finish in subsequent tables). In the investigation at the time of the finish, the seedlings are divided into three groups, the healthy ones having green leaves, the semi-withered ones with one-third to one-half of the leaves being yellowish brown, and the withered ones with all leaves being brown. The results are shown in Table 1 below consisting of three sub-tables. TABLE 1 The Invention Hereunder Control Areas Healthy 23 (27.1%) 13 (14.9%) Semi-withered 48 (56.5%) 54 (62.1%) Withered 14 (16.5%) 20 (23.0%) Comparison of the height of seedlings The Invention Hereunder Control Areas Semi- Semi- Healthy withered Healthy withered Start 46.00"

  "negative": "The disclosure is about aid equipment that caters to the stabilization of a patient's limbs while undergoing health check-ups or treatments. Typically in a clinical setting, patients might need to remain motionless and incapable of indicating any discomfort due to sedation. Various support solutions have been crafted to ensure the limbs are kept in place. Traditional methods include fixed limb shelves, which are suitable for keeping the arms at differing angles relative to the torso but have limitations when limbs need to be adjacent to the torso. Likewise, other firm supports might obstruct staff or cause unwanted pressure points. Some alternative solutions suggest using straps or contoured panels that envelop the arms lightly, in a bid to avoid the complications of rigid structures. These soft instruments could possibly be constructed from a variety of fabrics that are gentle on the skin, non-disruptive to imaging processes, and potentially single-use or sterilizable for repeated use. The employment of such devices involves laying the patient upon a surface, adjusting flexible regions around the arms without the need to shift the patient considerably, ensuring quick response capability in urgent situations.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/221,492, filed Jun. 29, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Disclosure The disclosure relates to devices for providing support and protection for a patient&#39;s arms during medical procedures. 2. Description of the Related Art Often during medical procedures, for example surgery, a patient may be under a general anesthetic or sedated to such an extent that he or she cannot protect or support himself/herself, as well as voice or indicate pain or discomfort to those in care of him/her. In addition, the precision and accuracy of the outcome of the medical procedure may be greatly improved by maintaining the patient in a secure and motionless position. The medical staff is responsible for taking every precaution to protect the patient when he or she is most vulnerable and unable to protect himself/herself. A number of devices have been developed to support and protect the arms of a patient in these circumstances. Rigid arm boards, on which the patient&#39;s arms are placed in various degrees of abduction from their body, often work quite well. However, when medical personnel need the arms positioned close to the body, these arm boards may prove too bulky and can often interfere with access to the patient for both the staff and equipment. In certain laparoscopic surgeries, including robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery, the patient&#39;s arms need to be snuggly adducted to their sides. Often a draw sheet is placed under the patient and the arms are tucked in to the patient&#39;s side. This maneuver can sometimes dislodge sites of vascular access or binding and create pressure points along the patient&#39;s arms, resulting in injury and damage to the nerves, which can be more problematic for the patient&#39;s recovery than the original surgery. Arm sleds or toboggans (named for their resemblance to such items) have also been used with varying success. These are often made of rigid plastic or metal. The \u201cC\u201d shaped end of these devices cradles the arm and the extended portion passes under the mattress beneath the patient. These devices can be cumbersome to position since the mattress on a surgical table is usually secured in the middle from head to toe with a wide strip of VELCRO\u00ae brand hook-and-loop fasteners. Most often the sled has to be positioned with the mattress lifted up. If sleds are needed for both arms, the mechanics of the problem become compounded. In addition, these sleds are very rigid, can interfere with the access of the medical staff to the patient, and are not very forgiving of the soft tissue or bones of the patient. Additional padding is often required, and pressure points are common since the weight of the patient&#39;s arm is not evenly distributed. Finally these devices can interfere with radiographic imaging, especially the metal sleds. A number of arm supports have been developed. Many rely on single or multiple straps or strap and buckle variations to secure the arms to the patient&#39;s side. In some models the patient ultimately rests on top of the strap which can press into the skin of the back. In other devices, releasing the device requires moving the patient from side to side. Certain devices support only the forearm. Existing devices may not evenly distribute or support the weight of the arm, which may create pressure points, which in turn may cause injuries. Some devices, for example the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,861,666, cover part of the torso of the patient as well as the arms, which may interfere with medical procedures. Other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0091749, have protector sections that wrap over the arm from the outside of the arm and that are connected to a surface of the device. The attachment tape that connects the protector sections to the surface is positioned between the patient&#39;s arm and the patient&#39;s body, so it may be difficult to see the attachment tape to secure or release it, especially if the patient&#39;s body is resting on the attachment tape. Also, because the attachment tape connects to a protector section at only one point, an entire protector section must be either secured around the arm or not secured around the arm. Some other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. 2008/0053464, have sleeves that hold the arms and have straps to secure the device in place. However, these straps may create pressure points, and the sleeves allow an entire arm to only be either covered or uncovered. Also, positioning the arm in the sleeve may require moving the patient&#39;s body. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE The devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the invention, certain features will now be discussed briefly. In one embodiment, a patient restraint device comprises a body section dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, wherein the body section includes first and second lateral edges, a first arm restraint attached to the first lateral edge, wherein the first arm restraint includes a first flexible member that is dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along a first length comprising a length of the patient&#39;s first arm from a location adjacent the patient&#39;s shoulder to a location adjacent the patient&#39;s wrist, and extend about a bottom surface and an outer periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm, and wherein the first arm restraint further includes a second flexible member dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along the first length, and extend about an inner periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm and mate with the first flexible member substantially continuously along the first length. In one embodiment, a patient restraining device comprises a support surface dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, a flexible inner panel dimensioned to extend about an inner periphery of a first arm of the patient, and a flexible outer panel dimensioned to extend about an outer periphery of the first arm to define a space with the flexible inner panel, wherein the space is dimensioned to receive the first arm. In one embodiment, a method for securing an arm of a patient comprises resting a torso of a patient on a support surface, positioning a first flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm proximate to the torso along a first length, wherein the first length substantially extends from the patient&#39;s shoulder to the patient&#39;s wrist, and positioning a second flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm distal to the torso along the first length, thereby positioning the arm in a space defined by the first and second flexible members.

Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the inventions herein described. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a soft surgical arm support 100. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , the soft surgical arm support 100 includes a first panel 110 and a second panel 120. In one embodiment, the first panel 110 is made from 5 mm neoprene. Other embodiments may be made include other materials or material of different thicknesses, including other polymers (for example, synthetic rubbers, nylon, and polyester), synthetic fibers (for example, spandex), and/or natural fibers (for example, paper and cotton). Some materials may advantageously not interfere with radiologic imaging of the patent, may be hypoallergenic, and/or may be very durable. Depending on the embodiment, the soft surgical arm support 100 may be disposable or reusable. The other components of the soft surgical arm support 100 may be made from the same materials that the first panel 110 may be made from. The first panel 110 is proximate to the patient and includes a support surface 115. The first panel 110 may be completely or partially covered by a fleece material 140. The fleece material 140 may provide extra cushioning for a patient and may provide a surface that is more comfortable to a patient&#39;s skin. The fleece material 140 may act as a fastener, for example the loop surface of a hook-and-loop fastener. The first panel 110 includes one or more first flexible members 113. A first flexible member 113 may include a portion of the first panel 110 adjacent to an edge of the first panel 110 that may move independently of the second panel 120. In one embodiment, one or more of the first flexible members 113 extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the first panel 110. The fleece material 140 may cover all or part of the first flexible member 113. The second panel 120 includes one or more second flexible members 123. A second flexible member 123 may include a portion of the second panel 120 near an edge of the second panel 120 that moves independently of the first panel 110. A second flexible member 123 may extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the second panel 120 and includes a fastener, for example a fastening surface 130. The fastening surface 130 may extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123. The first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be dimensioned to continuously extend along a length substantially equal to a distance between a patient&#39;s wrist and shoulder. The first flexible member 113 may be coupled to the second flexible member 123 , thereby defining a space 150. The space 150 may be dimensioned to receive an arm of a patient, and, for example, may substantially be in the shape of an open-ended cylinder. For example, the first flexible member 113 is bent in an arc to form a first part of a circumference of the space 150 and the second flexible member 123 is bent in an arc to form a second part of the circumference of the space 150. The second flexible member 123 overlaps the first flexible member 113 , and the first flexible member 113 is coupled to the second flexible member 123 at the overlap, for example using the fastening surface 130 and the fleece 140. Alternatively, the first flexible member 113 may overlap the second flexible member 123. Also, some embodiments may omit the first flexible member 113 or the second flexible member 123 , and the remaining flexible member may wrap over the arm to be coupled to the support surface 150. In one embodiment, the first flexible member 113 includes a loop surface, such as the fleece material 140 , and the second flexible member 123 includes a hook surface 130 , though the positions of the hook and/or loop surfaces may be switched. The fasteners on both the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be on the side proximal to the patient or distal to the patient, thereby creating a standing seam that extends away from or a seam that extends toward the patient&#39;s arm when the first flexible member is coupled to the second flexible member 123. Also, in other embodiments the first flexible member 113 does not overlap the second flexible member 123 or other fasteners are used, including adhesives (e.g., temporary adhesives), buttons, zippers, and laces. The second flexible member 123 and/or the first flexible member 113 , as well as the space 150 , may be substantially the same length as a patient&#39;s arm. This advantageously provides support or protection for substantially the entire arm. For example, the soft surgical arm support 100 may provide an extra layer of protection against cuts, scrapes, punctures, burns, etc., caused by undesired contact with surgical instruments, chemicals, etc. Also, in embodiments in which the fastening surfaces (for example, the fastening surface 130 and the fleece material 140 ) extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 , the second flexible member 123 may be coupled to the first flexible member 113 along substantially the entire length of the arm. This may distribute the force holding the arm in place along substantially the entire length of the arm, thereby reducing or eliminating pressure points on the arm. This advantageously reduces the risk of injury to a patient from pressure points, especially a patient who is sedated or unconscious. In use, the soft surgical arm support 100 is positioned on a patient bed. Since the soft surgical arm support 100 may be placed on top, there is no need to lift the bed or mattress to position the soft surgical arm support 100. A patient is positioned by lying down on the support surface 115. The first flexible member 113 is positioned around the inner periphery of the arm. The second flexible member 123 is positioned around the outer periphery of the arm, thereby positioning the arm in the space 150. The second flexible member 123 is coupled to the first flexible member 113 to secure the first flexible member 113 to the second flexible member 123 , thereby securing the arm in place. It will be appreciated that positioning the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may require little or no movement of the patient. The patient&#39;s arm may need to be lifted, but the patient&#39;s body does not need to be lifted from the support surface 115 to position the arm in the space. This reduces the risk of injury to the patient, who may be unconscious, heavily sedated, or otherwise unable to voluntarily move, and to medical personnel who would otherwise need to lift the patient. It also reduces the need to have multiple medical personnel lift and move the patient or the need to use equipment, for example a lift, to move the patient. It increases the speed of securing the arm of the patient and further allows the arm to be quickly released to provide rapid access to the arm in an emergency. Moreover, in some embodiments the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 extend to an upper surface of the circumference of the arm, which advantageously positions the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 on top of the arm, increasing the visibility of the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113. This further facilitates uncoupling the second flexible member 123 from the first flexible member 113 because the arm and the patient do not need to be moved to uncouple the members and because medical personnel can easily see where to grasp the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 to uncouple them. This improves access to the arm of the patient, for example to attach a medical device to the arm (such as an IV, a sensor, a bandage, etc.), to perform a medical procedure on the arm, or to release the arm. It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments the first flexible member 113 may be selectively decoupled from the second flexible member 123 along a portion of the interface between the members. This may allow medical personnel to access a portion of the arm while permitting the arm to be supported and protected by the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123. For example, medical personnel may decouple the first flexible member 113 from the second flexible member 123 adjacent to the forearm to attach an IV to the patient while leaving the first flexible member 113 coupled to the second flexible member 123 along the rest of the length of the arm (including the upper arm and wrist, for example), thereby holding the arm in place and protecting the enclosed portion of the arm while the IV is attached. Medical personal may adjust the location where they decouple the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 to access the arm in order to account for differences in arm lengths. Furthermore, some fasteners, for example hook-and-loop fasteners, may be coupled around a medical device (for example, a tube or a wire), which allows the arm to be re-enclosed in the space 150 while leaving the medical device attached to the arm and providing additional support to hold the medical device in a desired position."

  "query": "What features must a sports training apparatus possess to train athletes in achieving the optimum arc for the delivery of a ball?,",
  "negative": "The invention concerns a sports training device specifically designed to enhance the precision of athletes in projectile sports. This device includes an adaptable linear marker set before the athlete and the goal. The device is not influenced by the direction of the projectile but rather aims to give the athlete a sense of the optimal trajectory during the release phase. Athletes employ this device to refine their aiming skills and develop the ideal trajectory for their respective sport. The invention comprises a movable support that allows the player to execute real game-like actions while using the device. The linear marker's role is to act as a guide for the athlete, translating the theoretical ideal trajectory into a practical training session. The invention is characterized not by technology such as computers or radar that provides post-action data but by its ability to give real-time, visually comprehensible cues to the athlete during the training process. Thereby, filling the gap for a training aid that offers both immediate physical feedback and also promotes the kinetic repetition necessary for mastering the optimal projectile arc.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Prov. Pat. App. No. 61/926,505 filed on Jan. 13, 2014, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] This invention was not federally sponsored. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0003] This invention relates to the general field of sports equipment, and more specifically toward a sports training apparatus for training athletes to deliver a ball or other object at an appropriate arc. The sports training apparatus includes an adjustable horizontal target that is positioned between the athlete and the target. It gives guidance to the athlete at the time of release. The athlete&#39;s height, game being played, desired arc, technique employed and position on the court determine the appropriate configuration, placement, and use of the sports training apparatus described herein. Athletes use the sports training apparatus repeatedly to train, learn, and be able to repeat the desired arc for a particular shot in their sport. [0004] This sports training apparatus, also referred to as a multi-sport arc trainer, is designed to give feedback to athletes that are training with a ball. It gives a visual cue for the arc needed to be successful at acquiring the target. It is important for the athlete to have a guide at the beginning of a skill to receive immediate knowledge of the preferred ball trajectory. When the ball reaches the target and has cleared the trainer, the athlete has achieved the desired arc. There are two main factors that determine success in sports that have a ball with a target. One is the appropriate direction of the given target. The second is the angle that the ball is released from the player. This device is not intended to help with the direction of the ball. Rather, it is used to give the player a feel for the angle at release that is optimum for the skill involved. [0005] Other training apparatus have used round and square targets that require an athlete to \u201cshoot through\u201d the device to gain accuracy. This is flawed in two ways. First, there is an optimal arc desired in the skill, not a range. Shooting through a target gives the impression that anywhere within the target will get desired results. An optimum training aid will give as exact as possible a desired arc angle for the skill. Secondly, the limiting factor of a ring or square target makes it very difficult to use the aid in any kind of game like movement. It is very difficult to put a volleyball pass exactly in front of a ring target to insure that it will line up the setter with the target. Basketball players need to dribble and catch passes before shooting. It is hard to insure all of this happens exactly in front of a ring type target. Computer and radar devices do a good job of charting the arc with numbers and graphs, but they simply give you a result after the fact, and do not provide visual queues as the athlete is training. Thus there has existed a need for an apparatus for training athletes to deliver a ball at an appropriate arc while providing for game-like movements. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The current invention provides just such a solution by having a sports training apparatus for training athletes to deliver a ball or other object at an appropriate arc. The sports training apparatus includes an adjustable horizontal target that is positioned between the athlete and the target. It gives guidance to the athlete at the time of release. The athlete&#39;s height, game being played, desired arc, technique employed and position on the court are determine the appropriate configuration, placement, and use of the sports training apparatus described herein. Athletes use the sports training apparatus repeatedly to train, learn, and be able to repeat the desired arc for a particular shot in their sport. [0007] In a particular embodiment, the sports training apparatus disclosed herein is designed with an eight foot range of side to side movement, which enables the player to move in a game like manner. The sports training apparatus disclosed herein not only provides feedback on whether a ball is on the correct arc, it aids the athlete in starting the ball on the desired arc. [0008] The sports training apparatus includes an adjustable horizontal target. This apparatus should be positioned between the player and the target. The apparatus should be close to the player (for example, within six feet), so the release angle is quickly evaluated, and not placed at the height of the arc that is desired. The sports training apparatus gives guidance to the player at the time of release. There is no specific configuration as to the height and placement of the sports training apparatus that is necessarily applicable to all athletes because the variables for each player are without boundaries. The athlete&#39;s height, game being played, desired arc, technique employed and position on the court are always going to be variables that result in different desired configurations. The desired arc is determined, and then apparatus is positioned with the desired height to allow repeatability of action with the ball. A training goal for the sports training apparatus herein is \u201ccorrection at inception.\u201d [0009] It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for training an athlete to strike, throw, hit, or otherwise displace a ball at a desired arc. [0010] It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus that is configurable for multiple athletes, sports, and situations. [0011] It is a further object of this invention to provide an apparatus that aids athletes in starting a ball on a desired arc. [0012] A particular embodiment for the sports training apparatus is designed to be easily moved around the playing area. A wheeled base has locking wheels to keep it stationary when in use. The first section of the telescoping upright is five feet. The second section extends to an additional four feet. The top section extends three feet. The top height for the extending section is thus twelve feet. The middle of the three extension poles is marked every three inches to allow the user to set the pole height at the same position. The top extension has a line where it is to be positioned each time to ensure height consistency. This will help insure the same arc is being taught in subsequent practice sessions. There is an extension that extends parallel to the floor at the top of the telescoping pole and is eight feet long. It has a break in the middle with a sleeve that can be pulled apart for storage. It is connected to the telescoping pole with elastic cord that allows it to be folded in half. The parallel pole is the part used to guide the athlete&#39;s shot at release to the desired arc. There is a bell at the end of this parallel pole to give the player an auditory cue if the pole is contacted. The setup and take down time for this device has been timed at approximately ten seconds each.

  "query": "What is the effect of combining organophosphorus compounds with thiocarbamate herbicides in terms of soil persistence and herbicidal efficacy?,",
  "negative": "This invention pertains to combinations used for agricultural enhancements, specifically focusing on mixtures that leverage active thiocarbamate with synergistic elements to bolster its performance. The pairing of thiocarbamate with certain inert compounds leads to an augmentation in the longevity of the herbicidal action of thiocarbamate when applied to farmlands. Thiocarbamate, a compound acknowledged for its weed combating properties in various crops, displays amplified retention in soil composition when merged with selected enhancers devoid of inherent herbicidal properties. Experimental evidence suggests a tangible improvement in the duration of thiocarbamate's potency, confirmed through agricultural assays measuring weed suppression over extended periods. A new class of inert enhancer compounds is disclosed, demonstrating through soil analysis the capability to mitigate the degradation rate of thiocarbamate in the soil, thus preserving its plant growth inhibitory function. The invention discloses a unique herbicidal formulation including an effective portion of a thiocarbamate and a specific quantity of an inert synergistic compound, with optimal ratios disclosed for maximizing the duration of herbicidal impact in soil environments. Illustrations of appropriate thiocarbamates and enhancer compounds are provided, showing a coherent approach to boosting thiocarbamate performance without adverse ecological impacts. The disclosed methods capitalize on the synergistic relationship between the active and inert components, providing an innovative solution to maintaining prolonged herbicidal action.\n\n",

No. 507,616, filed Jun. 24, 1983; now abandoned which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to herbicidal compositions and methods of use. In particular, this invention relates to herbicidal compositions comprising an herbicidally active thiocarbamate in combination with an organophosphorus compound, the latter serving to prolong the effectiveness of a single application of the thiocarbamate herbicide in controlling undesired plant growth. Thiocarbamates are well known in the agricultural art as herbicides useful for weed control in crops such as corn, potatoes, beans, beets, spinach, tobacco, tomatoes, alfalfa, and others. Thiocarbamates are primarily used in pre-emergence application. They have been found to be particularly effective when incorporated into the soil prior to the planting of the crop. As a herbicide, the thiocarbamate is most concentrated immediately after its application. How long thereafter the initial concentration is retained depends in large part on the particular soil used. Thus the rate at which the thiocarbamate herbicide concentration declines following its application tends to vary from one type of soil to the next. This is evident both in the observable extent of actual weed control and in the detectable presence of undegraded thiocarbamate remaining in the soil after considerable time has elapsed. It has now been discovered that the soil persistence of certain herbicidally active thiocarbamates is significantly extended by the incorporation of certain organophosphorus compounds, which have no herbicidal activity of their own, into the herbicide formulation. This improvement in the soil persistence of the thiocarbamate can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Improved soil persistence can be shown by herbicidal efficacy tests, wherein the degree of weed injury is measured after a set period of time following application of the herbicide. In such a test, the organophosphorus compound, which has no herbicidal activity of its own, is shown to increase the herbicidal effectiveness of the thiocarbamate by increasing the persistence of the latter in the soil, and thus prolonging its effective life. Also demonstrated herein are soil persistence test results which evidence by periodic soil analyses that the number of thiocarbamate herbicide molecules that degrade in the soil is lessened in the presence of an organophosphorus extender of this invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel herbicidal composition comprising (a) an herbicidally effective amount of a thiocarbamate having the formula ##STR1## in which R 1 is C 1 -C 6 alkyl, R 2 is C 1 -C 6 alkyl, R 3 is C 1 -C 6 alkyl or cyclohexyl; and (b) an amount of an organophosphorus compound having the formula ##STR2## in which R 4 is C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 3 -C 6 alkenyl, C 3 -C 6 alkynyl, or C 5 -C 7 cycloalkyl, and is optionally substituted with one or members selected from halo, cyano, C 1 -C 3 alkoxy, and C 1 -C 3 alkylthio, R 5 is C 1 -C 4 alkyl, C 1 -C 4 alkoxy, or C 1 -C 4 alkylthio, R 6 is C 1 -C 10 alkyl, C 2 -C 10 alkenyl, or C 2 -C 4 alkynyl, optionally substituted with one or more members selected from halo, nitro, cyano, C 1 -C 3 alkoxy, and C 1 -C 3 alkylthio, C 5 -C 7 cycloalkyl, or -(R 7 ) m -\u03c6 in which R 7 is C 1 -C 4 alkyl, C 2 -C 4 alkenyl, or C 2 -C 4 alkynyl, optionally substituted with one or more members selected from halo and cyano, m is zero or one, and \u03c6 is phenyl or phenylthio optionally substituted with one or more members selected from halo, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, C 1 -C 3 alkyl, C 1 -C 3 alkoxy, C 1 -C 3 carbalkoxy, C 1 -C 3 alkylsulfinyl, formyl, \u03b1-nitrovinyl, \u03b1-ethylthio-\u03b1-cyanovinyl, \u03b1-cyanovinyl, and \u03b1-butynyl, X is oxygen or sulfur, and Y is oxygen or sulfur, sufficient to extend the soil life of said thiocarbamate.

This invention further relates to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation comprising applying the above composition to the locus where control is desired. As used herein, the term &#34;alkyl,&#34; &#34;alkenyl,&#34; and &#34;alkynyl&#34; are intended to include both straight-chain and branched-chain radicals unless otherwise indicated. All carbon atom ranges are intended to be inclusive of their upper and lower limits. The term &#34;halogen atom&#34; or &#34;halo&#34; is used to designate fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atoms, as well as any combination thereof. The term &#34;herbicide,&#34; as used herein, means a compound which adversely controls or modifies the growth of plants. By the term &#34;herbicidally effective amount&#34; is meant an amount of compound which causes an adverse modifying effect upon the growth of plants. By &#34;plants&#34; is meant germinant seeds, emerging seedlings and established vegetation, including roots and aboveground portions. Such adverse controlling or modifying effects include all deviations from natural development, for example, killing, retardation, defoliation, desiccation, regulation, stunting, tillering, stimulation, leaf burn, dwarfing and the like. The phrase &#34;to extend the soil life of said thiocarbamate&#34; is used herein to denote the effect whereby herbicidal effectiveness of the thiocarbamate is maintained in substantially the same form it assumed when first applied to the locus. An extended soil life can be manifest in a slower rate of decline of weedkilling potency. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, the above-described organophosphorus compound is added to the thiocarbamate in order to prolong the molecular integrity and herbicidal effectiveness of the latter. As the examples below indicate, there is no critical range of the ratio of these two components. The soil-life-extending effect is observable over a broad range of ratios. It is most convenient, however, to apply the compounds in a weight ratio of from about 0.1:1 to about 50:1 (thiocarbamate: organophosphorus). Preferably, the weight ratio ranges from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and most preferably from about 1:1 to about 15:1. Examples of thiocarbamates which are useful in the present invention are S-ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiocarbamate, S-ethyl N,N-diisobutylthiocarbamate, S-n-propyl N,N-di-n-propylthiocarbamate, S-n-propyl-N-ethyl-N-n-butylthiocarbamate, and S-ethyl-N-ethyl-N-cyclohexyl thiocarbamate. Examples of organophosphorus compounds which are useful in the present invention are O,O-diethyl-O-phenyl phosphorothioate, O,O-diethyl-O-benzyl phosphorothioate, O-ethyl-O-phenyl-S-n-propyl phosphorodithioate, O-ethyl-S-ethyl-O-phenyl phosphorodithioate, O-ethyl-O-phenyl-S-n-butyl phosphorodithioate, O,O,-diethyl-O-cyclohexyl phosphorothioate, O,O,-diethyl-O-meta-clorophenyl phosphorothioate, O-butyl-O-methyl-O-phenyl phosphorothioate, O,O-di-n-propyl-O-phenyl phosphorothioate, O,O,-dimethyl-O-benzyl phosphorothioate, O-2-chloroethyl-O-ethyl-O-phenyl phosphorothioate, O-ethyl-O-phenyl-S-isobutyl phosphorodithioate, O-n-propyl-S-ethyl-O-phenyl phosphorodithioate, and O-phenyl-O-n-propyl-S-n-propyl phosphorodithioate. Further examples are listed in the test dat shown below. The usefulness of many thiocarbamates as herbicides can be significantly broadened to include a wider variety of crops by the inclusion of an antidote in the herbicide formulation. The antidote protects the crop from injury by the herbicide, increasing the tolerance of the crop for the herbicide. The herbicide is thus rendered more selective in its action, retaining its potency against the undesired weeds, while showing a decreased herbicidal effect against the desired crop species. The antidotes which are especially effective in protecting crops from thiocarbamate herbicides can be described as amides of haloalkanoic acids. Such antidotes are preferably amides of dihaloalkanoic acid, such as, dichloroacetic acid. Said haloalkanoic or dihaloalkanoic acids preferably have 2 to 7 carbon atoms.

The following examples are offered to illustrate the compositions, methods, and effectiveness of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. EXAMPLE 1 Herbicidal Activity Improvement Tests This example offers herbicidal activity test data for many representative extender compounds within the scope of this invention showing their effectiveness in improving the herbicidal activity of thiocarbamates. The effect is observed by comparing the extent of weed control in test flats treated with a thiocarbamate against that occuring in similar flats treated with both the thiocarbamate and the extender. The soil used in these tests was a sandy loam soil from Sunol, Calif., which was pre-treated with the herbicide to simulate a typical field which had received previous herbicide applcations. The Sunol sandy loam soil analyzed as follows: sand 63.1%; silt-21.2%; clay-12.4%, organic matter-1%; and pH 6.9. cl A. Soil Pre-Treatment A solution was prepared by diluting an emulsifiable liquid concentrate containing 6 lb/gal (0.72 kg/l) (76.8% by weight) of the herbicide S-ethyl di-n-propylthiocarbamate in 200 ml of water, such that the resulting concentration of herbicide in the solution was 2000 mg/l. Two hundred ml of this solution was then added to 200 lb (90.8 kg) of soil to which 17-17-17 fertilizer had been previously added to a concentration of 50 ppm by weight with respect to the soil. The mixture was mixed in a rotary mixer for 10 to 30 minutes. The soil was then placed in round plastic containers, 7.5 inches (19.0 cm) in diameter by 7.5 inches (19.0 cm) deep. The soil was tamped and leveled with a row marker to impress one row across the width of each container. This row was seeded with watergrass (Echinochloa crus-galli). Sufficient seeds were planted to produce several seedlings. The containers were then placed in a greenhouse maintained at 20\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C. and watered daily by sprinkler. Five weeks after treatment, the soil was allowed to dry out and the plant foliage was removed. The soil was then passed through a 0.25 inch (0.64 cm) screen to remove plant roots and clods. B. Herbicide Test A solution was prepared by diluting an emulsifiable liquid concentrate containing 6 lb/gal. (0.72 kg/l) (76.8% by weight) of the herbicide S-ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiocarbamate in 675 ml of water such that the resulting concentration of herbicide in the solution was 1.48 mg/ml. Five ml of this solution when added to three pounds of soil yielded a quantity in the soil equivalent to three pounds per acre. The extender compounds were used in technical form. These materials were added 5 ml acetone and 14.5 ml water such that the resulting concentration of the extender in the solution was 1.54 mg/ml. Five ml of this solution when added to three pounds of soil yielded a quantity in the soil equivalent to four pounds per acre. Five ml of the extender solution and 5 ml of the herbicide solution were tank-mixed. The resultant mixture of 10 ml was then added to 3 lbs of soil and incorporated into the soil by a rotary mixer. Thus, 10 ml of the mixture and 3 pounds of soil were placed in rotary mixter and incorporated. The treated soil was then placed in aluminum flats which were approximately 3 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 8 inches long (7.6\u00d710.2\u00d720.3 cm). The soil was tamped and leveled with a row marker to impress six rows across the width of the flat. The test weeds were as follows: ______________________________________ ABBRE-COMMON NAME VIATION SCIENTIFIC NAME______________________________________watergrass WG Echinochloa crus-galli (L.)wild"

  "query": "What are the advantages of using l-lactate rather than d,l-lactate anions in fluid therapy?,",
  "negative": "This invention pertains to the domain of intravenous rehydration techniques. Specifically, it focuses on the composition of intravenous solutions involving the use of saccharide-based anions in place of typical chloride ions in combination with various cations. The invention does not encompass the administration of solutions containing either racemic mixtures or pure isomers of lactate. The past solutions have included significant amounts of glucose and fructose anions in their formulations, provided in well-defined ratios corresponding to the usual sodium ion concentrations; see related patent applications Ser. Nos. 132,456 and 132,789, filed March 5, 1986. However, the present invention realizes that there are opportunities beyond these specific saccharide-to-sodium ion proportions. Previous methods of incorporating saccharide anions into therapeutic intravenous fluids have not accounted for the physiological impact distinct saccharide agents can have. Pure glucose solutions, for example, are common in medical settings, but are not differentiated in terms of their stereochemistry or biological behavior. It is well documented that certain glucose isomers may have differing metabolic pathways and effects, similar to that of lactate isomers, yet there has been no attempt to separate these isomers for therapeutic uses. Compositionally, mixed glucose solutions are typically used in intravenous therapies without specification of isomer forms. As a result, the unspecified glucose mixture is what is typically found in medical practice. This invention suggests that the therapeutic efficacy and safety of intravenous fluids can be optimized by selecting preferred glucose isomers for particular medical conditions. For instance, usage of d-glucose over other forms could enhance cellular uptake without the drawbacks seen with l-forms. Thus, the saccharide-based intravenous solutions proposed herein aim to deliver enhanced care by tailoring the solution composition to patient physiological needs while maintaining compatibility with current infusion systems and procedures. The advantages of adopting such saccharide-specific intravenous solutions are anticipated to align with the goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing potential complications without altering the recognized therapeutic properties of the fluids. In summary, this proposal does not involve altering historic lactate-based solutions but introduces the innovation of saccharide-specific intravenous solutions to the field of fluid resuscitation therapy.\n",
  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATION This present application is a continuation-in-part of my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 810,918, filed Dec. 18, 1985, now abandoned, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 748,232, filed June 24, 1985, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,633,166 which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 623,102 filed June 22, 1984, now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention lies in the field of fluid therapy in humans, and more particularly in the field of aqueous solutions for parenteral, oral, dialysis, and irrigation therapy which employ at least one of l-lactate anions, pyruvate anions, d- betahydroxybutyrate anions, acetoacetate anions, or mixtures thereof in combination with selected cations. 2. Prior Art Previously, I have provided improved electrolyte solutions for in vivo and in vitro usage which contain l-lactate and pyruvate anions, and/or d-betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate anions in respective defined ratios in combination with defined Na:Cl ratios; see my copending U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 748,232 and 747,792, both filed June 24, 1985, and also my copending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 747,858 and 748,184, also filed on such date. However, it is now appreciated that the benefits of using l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and/or acetoacetate anions need not be restricted by these previously taught relationships of anion pair ratios to Na:Cl ratios. The prior art indicated in the 37 Background&#34; sections of these earlier patent applications is incorporated by reference into the present application. Previously, only racemic mixtures of lactate anions containing both d- and l- forms of lactate have been used in aqueous solutions for human parenteral therapy. The other major organic anion used in human parenteral fluids has been acetate. So far as is now known, the natural l-form of lactate anion has heretofore never been used, apart from the unnatural d- form, in human fluid therapy. Sodium lactate solutions, used in pharmaceutical practices, are not specified in terms of isomeric structure. In the U.S. and British Pharmacopeias, lactate is defined and approval was duly granted for use of the d,l-lactate mixture. Hence, the d,l-lactate is the form used in contemporary pharmaceutical practice. The l-lactate is recognized to be the physiologically predominant form which is metabolized by different pathways and with different effects than is the d-lactate. The toxicity of d-lactate has been described in humans (see Oh MS et al N Eng J Med 301: 249-251, 1979; Perlmutter, DH et al J Pediatrics 102: 234-238, 1983; Stolberg, L et al N Eno J Med 306: 1344-1348, 1982). Thus, the d- form has now been discovered to cause adverse and toxic effects when administered to mammals. For example, when an aqueous 20 mM/1 d-lactate (or d-lactic acid) is administered parenterally to a rat, swelling of brain tissue is observed because the brain takes in the slowly metabolized d-lactate - plus an equivalent amount of K +. With continued administration, coma develops, the cerebral edema worsens and death ensues. In contrast, when l-lactate is similarly administered, the differential concentration of l-lactate between intracellular and extracellular fluid does not cause coma or death. For another example, Veech et al. (Veech, RL and Fowler, RC., &#34;Cerebral Dysfunction and Respiratory Alkalosis During Peritoneal Dialysis with d-Lactate Containing Peritoneal Dialysis Fluids&#34;. Am. J. Med., 1987 (in press)) points out that the severe recurrent metabolic alkelemia described by Kenamond et al. (&#34;Severe Recurrent Alkalemia in a Patient Undergoing Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis&#34;. Am. J. Med., 548-550, 1986) was secondary to an encephalopathy caused by the inclusion of d,l-lactate in routine dialysis fluids. Because of such encephalopathological results, parenteral solutions containing the racemic d,l-lactate anions should not be administered for therapeutic purposes. All previous commercial formulations of fluids for human therapy use lactate or lactic acid in the racemic d,l form as defined in the United States or British Pharmacopeia (see the United States Pharmacopeia 21st edition, January 1985, p 581, 945-946, 1186; United States Pharmacopeia Convention, Rockville, and British Pharmacopeia 1980, p 250, 666, 667, Her Majesty&#39;s Stationary Office, London). Sodium d,l-lactate solutions are currently and conventionally used for three major purposes in current medical practice. First, sodium d,l-lactate solution is used parenterally as an alkalinizing agent to correct acidosis. Secondly, it is used in parenteral fluid therapy to normalize the Na:Cl ratio from the l:l ratio found in normal saline. Thirdly, it is used as the counter ion in peritoneal dialysis solutions. In addition, it could also be used in current hemodialysis to replace the acetate anion, or, in its H + form, as an acid to be added to a bicarbonate hemodialysis fluid. Prior to the teachings contained in my afore referenced USSN 748,232, pyruvate anions d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, and acetoacetate anions in aqueous solution, so far as is now known, were never used in human therapeutic fluids. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for accomplishing fluid therapy without encephalopathy or metabolic bone disease and other complications resulting from use of present fluid formulations in a living human involving the introduction into the body of such human an aqueous solution containing at least one permeant monoanionic metabolite selected from the group consisting of l-lactate anions, pyruvate anions, d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, acetoacetate anions, or mixtures of such anions. Here, l-lactate is defined as that form of lactate anion found in mammalian tissues and designated l or L-lactate. It is identified by its ability to react with NAD + to form pyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by mammalian lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). The form of l-lactate which is dextrorotatory in aqueous solution is designated l-(+) while the salts of l-lactate which in aqueous solution are levorotatory are designated l-(-)lactate (see US Dispensatory. Osol, A, Pratt, R, Gennar, AR,, eds. p 658. JR Lippcott. Philadelphia, 1973). Pyruvate and acetoacetate have no sterospecificity. More particularly, this invention is directed to improved methods and optionally stable fluids for conventional administration to humans such as, (a) oral ingestion of an aqueous solution containing at least one of such anions, or a mixture of such anions, (b) parenteral therapy involving, for example, the intravenous administration of an aqueous solution containing at least one of such anions, or a mixture thereof, (c) dialysis therapy (hemo or peritoneal) using aqueous solutions containing at least one of such anions, (d) dialysis therapy (hemo or peritoneal) where acetic acid is replaced with at least one acid of the group consisting of l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate or acetoacetic acid, preferably l-lactate, and/or (e) irrigation therapy. One presently preferred such anion comprises 1-lactate. Thus, surprisingly, encephalopathy, metabolic bone disease, and many other complications are not only completely avoided by using 1-lactate (or one of the other metabolite anions herein identified and used in the practice of this invention) in place of racemic d-l-lactate, but also the substitution of, for example, l-lactate for d-l-lactate, in solutions employed in fluid therapy, does not cause any change in the heretofore known beneficial physiological or pharmacological effectiveness of such fluids. In general, a solution containing at least one such anion is administerable for generally the same purposes that prior art parenteral fluids or dialysis fluids are used which contain racemic d-l-lactate anions. For examples, such a solution can be used to treat acidosis, dehydration, blood electrolyte depletion, shock, malnutrition, uremia and the like. Because mixtures of l-lactate anions and pyruvate anions, and mixtures of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions, in solutions each constitute nearequilibrium couples, which can vary widely in concentration under normal physiological conditions, as explained, for example, in my aforereferenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 748,232, these anions can be employed with little or no adverse side effects in parenteral fluids and the like. Moreover, the therapeutic use of these anion couples (a) tends to maintain a normal plasma milliequivalent ratio of sodium cations to chloride anions, (b) thus tends to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis, and (c) accomplishes electrolyte and fluid and resuscitation therapy. The anions taught by this invention permit one to avoid the known untoward effects of high levels of the d-lactate anion (see Veech, RL, Fowler, RC, op. cited above) or of acetate anion which are now the major organic anions conventionally added to parenteral fluids (See Veech RL. The toxic impact of parenteral solutions on the metabolism of cells: a hypothesis for physiological parenteral therapy. Am J Clin Nutr 44: 519-551, 1986). Other and further objects, aims, purposes, features, advantages, embodiments, applications, and the like will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present specification taken together with the claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION For the fluid therapy purposes of my present invention, any conventional administration procedure is suitable, although parenteral (particularly intravenous) administration during hemo or peritoneal dialysis is presently preferred. For example, sodium l-lactate aqueous solutions, which are stable and easily sterilized, can be used in infusion fluids in place of sodium bicarbonate for treatment for acidosis. For example, the bicarbonate may be dissolved immediately before use in the infusion fluid by light agitation and preferably warmed to body temperature. In such a replacement, 1 g sodium bicarbonate corresponds to about 1.33 g sodium l-lactate, and 1 g sodium l-lactate corresponds to about 0.75 g sodium bicarbonate. The bicarbonate or l-lactate solutions are preferrably administered diluted with glucose solution or distilled water. The alkalizing action of sodium l-lactate is diminished in severe liver damage since its breakdown is retarded. See, for example, Documenta Geigy 6th ed, pp. 331-332, Geigy, Manchester, 1962. In practice, the calculation of the quantity of an alkalizing infusion solution required for adults is based on an average value for the water content of the body of 50% by weight and on a uniform intra- and extra-cellular distribution of bicarbonate, l-lactate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and other aforementioned permeant monovalent anionic metabolites. This method naturally yields only rough figures. The calculation can be simplified by reckoning in milliequivalents desired change in the alkali reserve. For example, in order to increase or decrease the alkali reserve in a patient weighing 70 kg by 5 mEq, a quantity of, for example, l-lactate, bicarbonate or d-betahydroxybutyrate anions of 70\u00d76\u00d70.5=210 mEq must be administered. In order to avoid the danger of an acidosis becoming converted into an alkalosis, it is advisable not to attempt a complete normalization of the alkali reserve by means of an alkalizing solution, and such solutions should never be administered without supplementary potassium. In children, a higher water content of about 66% must be reckoned with, so that the calculation yields relatively high infusion quantities. The differences between the calculated and observed effects of alkalizing and of acidifying compounds can be considerable since the above approximate calculation ignores a number of important factors. In diabetic acidosis, many authors consider it is inadvisable to administer large quantities of sodium salts without potassium salts. On the other hand, extremely good results have been reported in the intensive lactate treatment of diabetic coma. There is no doubt that a moderate alkali therapy with l-lactate and/or pyruvate is indicated in diabetic ketosis with very much lowered alkali reserve, since it has been shown that insulin activity is inhibited by acidosis and that acidosis increases the blood sugar. Clearly use of d-betahydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate would not be suitable for use in diabetic ketoacidosis. As those skilled in the art will also appreciate, the ketone bodies would not be appropriate for use in pregnant women. When using solutions such as &#34;Lactated Ringer&#39;s&#34; (see, for example, my aforereferenced USSN 748,232) to replete body water and electrolytes, the 28 mM d,l-lactate of the prior art is replaced with, for example, 28 mM l-lactate. In this way, the Na:Cl ratio, in such an l-lactate solution, is moved, if desired, towards a normal ratio of 1.36 as found in normal human plasma. Thus, hyperchloremic acidosis resulting from large infusions of normal sodium chloride solutions is avoided. The same considerations apply to use of such solutions in dialysis (see, for example, my aforereferenced US patent applications Ser. Nos. 748,232 and 748,184). Alternatively, in all the present new solutions, d-betahydroxybutyrate anions, for example, can be used alternatively in place of l-lactate anions. Additional benefits may accrue from the use alternate or combined use of pyruvate and acetoacetate. A preferred application for this invention involves usage of a mixture of anions of l-lactate and pyruvate, or a mixture of anions d-betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, as indicated, in solutions. Under special circumstances, use of one or the other of such anions alone may be preferred, such as in cases of severe reduction of the pyridine nucleotide systems where administration of pyruvate anions may be preferred. In conditions where long stability of mixed aqueous solutions presents a practical problem, use of l-lactate or d-betahydroxybutyrate alone confers stability on the solution and is to be preferred over the currently used d,l-lactate or acetate. For one example, to correct an acidosis wherein a 70 kg man is 6 mEq below the normal plasma bicarbonate level of 26-30 mEq/L, then 70\u00d76\u00d70.5 or 210 mEq is infused with a fluid of this invention containing bicarbonate anions and l-lactate anions as described hereinbelow, over a 2 to 4 hour period. Other dosages and rates of infusion may be used, if desired, depending on the clinical situation. For a second example, a liter of solution of the composition of the current Ringer&#39;s lactate (for the composition thereof, see my aforereferenced USSN 748,232) may be infused over a four hour period into a dehydrated 70 kg man with the exception that the d,l-lactate used is replaced with l-lactate. For a third example, the prior art accomplishment of peritoneal dialysis by infusion into the peritoneum of 2L of a conventional d,l-lactate based or acetate based peritoneal dialysis solution, is changed in that the 35-45 mM d,l-lactate or acetate is altered and replaced by 35-45mM l-lactate. After remaining in the peritoneum for about 1/2 hour, the fluid is drained off and the process repeated until the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is decreased to the level desired. In parenteral therapy, the total concentration of anions selected from the above indicated anion group, a present preference being l-lactate, pyruvate, and/or mixtures thereof, can range from about 0.01 to 2400 millimoles per liter, though larger and smaller quantities can be used depending upon circumstances. The rate of introduction into a human patient, and the dosage used, are generally the same as are conventionally used in solutions containing, for example, d,l-lactate. A present preference is to employ, for fluid therapy, an aqueous solution wherein the total concentration of l-lactate or pyruvate anions ranges from about 1 Molar to 1 millimolar. In a more preferred form, from about 28 to 45 millimoles (total) of such anions are present (such as in an improved Ringer&#39;s lactate or in improved peritoneal dialysis fluids). Although a solution taught by the present invention may contain either l-lactate or pyruvate alone, as essentially the sole organic metabolic anion, a mixture of l-lactate anions and pyruvate anions may also be used, and similarly a mixture of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions may be used. When such an anion redox couple is employed, it is presently preferred to employ a milliequivalent ratio of l-lactate anions to pyruvate anions in the range from about 20:1 to 1:1, and a milliequivalent ratio of d-betahydroxybutyrate anions to acetoacetate anions in the range from about 6:1 to 0.5:1. The l-lactic, pyruvic, d-betahydroxybutyric, and acetoacetic acids themselves as such, may be used. For example, such can be used in combination with aqueous bicarbonate anions; for instance, in sodium bicarbonate containing solutions. Also, one can employ, in the starting solutions used in the processes of present invention, aqueous solutions which contain, along with such metabolite anions as taught in this invention, at least one cation selected from the group consisting of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ammonium. Preferably, from about 0.01 to 2400 millimoles per liter of such anions are present. Inorganic physiologically acceptable anions, besides bicarbonate, may also be present, such as chloride, phosphate, and sulfate, if desired, and if such are present, the respective quantities present are preferably similar to corresponding physiologic levels. A difference between the total milliequvalents of the cations present in a solution and the total milliequivalents of the organic anions of the specified group employed in the practice of this invention (l-lactate, pyruvate, d-betahydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate) can be provided by other physiologically acceptable anions. It is considered to be physiologically advantageous and it is generally preferred in the practice of this invention, to maintain the levels of the respective organic metabolite anions employed at values which are approximately physiologic. Also, when a mixture of the monocarboxylic metabolic anions is employed in a given solution, it is not necessary to employ redox couple anion pairs since this use of these defined monocarboxylic metabolite anions does not produce the toxic effects resulting from the present use of d,l-lactate or acetate. Further, it appears to be desirable to employ such anionic metabolites in combination with bicarbonate anions in conditions where large volumes of fluid are to be used and administration of calories is not desired, such as in peritoneal dialysis. Additionally and preferably, such a solution may contain dissolved therein at least one osmotically active, substantially nonionic substance in accord with, for example, teachings for prior art d,l-lactate and acetate containing solutions. Examples of suitable such nonionic substances include glucose (preferred), fructose, glycerol, sorbitol, and the like. Typically, and preferably, such a solution has an osmolarity ranging from about 240 to 2400 mOsmoles/liter. In addition, formulations containing ionic nutrients, such as l- amino acids, can benefit from the addition of at least one of the metabolite monocarboxylic acid anions taught herein. For example, the acetate anions present in current commercial amino acid formulations (which lead to metabolic bone disease) can be replaced by such anions. See, for example, my copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 810,916, filed Dec. 18, 1985, and its continuation-in-part application filed on even date herewith, all the teachings of which are entirely incorporated hereinto by reference. Also preferably, a starting solution used in the practice of this invention has a pH in the range from about 5 to 9, although for the contemplated human usage, a most preferred pH is about 7.4."

The proposed invention encompasses the use of marine invertebrate eggs meticulously sourced from controlled aquatic environments. In these environments, the invertebrates feed on a diet of algae and marine plants, facilitating a natural life cycle. The composition consists primarily of lipids, fatty acids, and marine minerals like sodium and potassium, creating a soothing formula intended for topical dermatological products.

Notably, this invention does not claim any impact on stem cells or aging processes of the skin but instead offers a cautionary treatment for common and uncomfortable skin ailments.\n\n",
  "pos": "[0001] The present invention relates to a product obtained from gastropod spawn, to be used in the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions capable of activating and mobilising skin stem cells, as well as preventing the loss thereof that takes place as a consequence of chronological and/or premature ageing of the skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The skin is the largest organ in the human, or animal, body. It acts as a protective barrier that isolates the body from the surrounding medium, protecting it and contributing to preserve its structures intact, whilst acting as a communication system with the environment. The skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the most superficial layer, the dermis, which is the intermediate layer, and the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, which is the deepest layer of the skin. [0003] Since it is the outermost organ, the skin is subjected to significant deterioration and aggression, which leads to premature ageing of the skin. The external factors that act thereon include excess solar radiation, atmospheric contamination, abusive use of surfactants, tobacco smoke, etc. But the skin may also suffer from premature ageing as a result of internal or endogenous factors, such as those related to an unbalanced nutrition in terms of vitamins, iatrogenic factors such as radiotherapy, the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, etc., or the presence in the body of very reactive toxins such as those ingested by drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. Natural ageing also occurs as a consequence, for example, of the production of free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA alterations, etc. [0004] Deterioration of the skin appears in the form of wrinkles, spots, laxity, benign neoplasms, etc. [0005] Numerous cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions have been disclosed for treatment of the skin, and the care and cleaning thereof, composed of very different ingredients, which include plant extracts and animal extracts. In this regard, one of the ingredients used in the preparation of skin care cosmetics have been gastropod secretions, what is commonly referred to as snail slime. Thus, for example, document DE1813154 discloses a composition designed for skin care that contains a fat and one or more active agents, which contains the slippery lubricating secretion excreted by a snail, particularly Helix pomatia. Patent FR2595247 discloses that extracts from the mucous membranes or digestive juices of gastropods are useful in cosmetics at concentrations ranging between 0.1%-10% due to their moisturising action on the epidermal surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,740 discloses an active ingredient for cosmetic or therapeutic compositions obtained from the secretion of a centrifuged live gastropod, and said compositions may be applied to skin care. [0006] On the other hand, document CA2611645 discloses the use of a Helix aspersa \u201csnail slime\u201d product to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells in vitro. [0007] A stem cell is a cell that has the capacity to renew itself by means of mitotic divisions or to continue the differentiation pathway for which it is programmed. Moreover, it is capable of producing cells of one or more mature, functional, fully differentiated tissues, as a function of its degree of multipotentiality. Most of the tissues of an adult individual have their own specific population of stem cells which allow for their periodical renewal or their regeneration when tissue damage occurs. In particular, the epidermis undergoes constant renewal and consists of a stratified squamous epithelium associated with pilose follicles and sebaceous glands. These specialised structures are maintained by the self-renewal of epidermal stem cells and the differentiation of the offspring thereof. Skin stem cells are crucial for the healing of wounds and the regeneration of the skin and the hair. However, the capacity of stem cells may be diminished due to genetic problems, environmental influences and the ageing process. Therefore, the protection of stem cells is extremely important. [0008] Although snail secretions are known to be useful for the preparation of skin cosmetics, thus far no product derived from snail spawn has been disclosed for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions that has a proven action on skin stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof and, consequently, preventing and correcting ageing of the skin. [0009] In this regard, the present invention discloses a product obtained from gastropod spawn for the preparation of cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions which has been shown to have very beneficial effects on the skin, preventing and correcting the ageing thereof by acting directly on epithelial stem cells. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0010] The object of the present invention consists of a product prepared from gastropod spawn of the family Helicidae, which is used for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions for the skin. Said product has the capacity to act on stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof as a consequence of ageing of the skin caused by both endogenous and exogenous stressful factors. [0011] The product is composed of organic and inorganic molecules from snail spawn, the organic molecules being polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, peptides and amino acids, where the proteins and glycoproteins present a characteristic electrophoretic pattern, similar to that shown in FIG. 1 , and the inorganic molecules being cations and anions such as phosphate, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium, in their most stable ion forms. [0012] The product derived from snail spawn is used in the preparation of dermo-cosmetic compositions in the form of serum, solutions, injectables (monodose), gel (Hydragel), o/w gel-cream, w/o gel-cream, o/w cream, w/o cream, w/s cream, o/w/o cream, extemporaneous facial mask preparations, patches and, in general, all dermo-cosmetic (cosmeceutical) forms that may be used in the formulation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical products. Said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, facilitates the rescue of skin stem cells intended to disappear due to senescence or endogenous or exogenous aggressions, and promotes the activation of said cells, as shown in Example 2 of the present specification. This activation is characterised by premature induction of DNA replication during cell division. [0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18\u00b0 C.-24\u00b0 C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21\u00b0 C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0023] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration of 70% (w/w), in purified water; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a Silverson mill; they are filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of a cream, using it at a 70% concentration. Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or \u201cbulge\u201d (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (\u201cbulge\u201d) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4\u00b0 C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4\u00b0 C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5\u00d70.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group."

  "query": "What invention helps decrease the incidence of bone screw penetration through the articular surface of the humeral head?,",
  "negative": "The disclosed technology describes a structural assembly for consolidating and restoring the integrity of a compromised skeletal section. Notably, the technology focuses on a skeletal bracket designed for reinforcing connections across a disjointed radius, including the distal radius and the radial shaft. The innovative structure pertains to a skeletal bracket tailored to manipulate optimal trajectories for fastening elements that pass through it to minimize the likelihood of these elements breaching the joint area of the radial head. This technology addresses the drawbacks of current fixation systems used to mend the distal radius, which mandate the positioning of a skeletal bracket against the radial styloid. To secure the skeletal bracket to the distal radius, fastening elements are drilled through the bracket into the radius. During this placement, the fastening elements typically assume an almost vertical stance against the joint plane of the radial head, which does not offer sufficient structural support to sustain firm attachment of the skeletal bracket to the distal radius while countering forces exerted by the articulated joints. As such, incidents of disrupted joint integrity and bracket stabilization are prevalent. To amplify the fixture's stability, it is imperative to opt for long fastening elements to enhance their hold. Yet, due to the steep incline of the fastening elements in relation to the joint plane, any relative subsidence or compression of the radial head to the skeletal bracket may result in the ends of the fastening elements projecting into the joint area. Consequently, there is a substantial occurrence rate of joint transgression. Therefore, the proposed technology introduces a fixture and a method for its deployment that promise more favorable fastener orientations respective to the joint surface of the radial head and a more robust connection between the skeletal bracket and the radius. Such a fixture will guarantee that the fastening elements are placed at varied angles that are more oblique to the joint surface, hence preventing both the destabilization of joint fixation and the disruption of joint integrity, as well as averting the pass-through of the fastening elements in the joint area of the radial head.\n\n",
  "pos": "[0001] The present application claims the benefit of provisional Application No, 61/449,012, filed Mar. 3, 2011; which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present invention generally relates to a fixation device used to facilitate reduction and repair of a fractured bone. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bone plate for creating a mechanically stronger connection between the bone plate and portions of a fractured humerus including the proximal humerus and the humeral shaft. More specifically, the present invention relates to a bone plate configured to provide optimal angles for bone screws received therethrough to decrease the incidence of penetration of the bone screws through the articular surface of the humeral head. [0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art [0005] Current state of the art in surgical fracture fixation of the proximal humerus requires the application of a bone plate to the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus. To attach the bone plate to the proximal humerus, bone screws (threadably or non-threadably engaging the bone plate) are inserted through the bone plate into the proximal humerus. In attaching the bone plate to the proximal humerus, the bone screws are ultimately received under the surface of the humeral head. [0006] The bone screws used to attach the bone plate to the proximal humerus will likely be disposed at a significantly perpendicular angle with respect to the articular surface of the humeral head. This attachment orientation provides insufficient mechanical strength to maintain rigid attachment of the bone plate to the proximal humerus when subjected to joint reaction forces. As such, there remains a significant incidence of loss of fracture reduction and fracture fixation. In order to maximize stability of the connection, it is necessary to utilize long bone screws, so as to maximize the purchase thereof. However, given the significantly perpendicular angle of the bone screws relative to the articular surface, if there is any collapse or subsidence of the humeral head relative to the bone plate, the tips of the bone screws will penetrate the articular surface. Accordingly, there also remains a significant incidence of joint penetration. [0007] Therefore, there is a need for a fixation device and method of use associated therewith that provides more optimal screw angles with respect to the articular surface of the humeral head and a mechanically stronger connection between the bone plate and the humerus. Such a fixation device can insure that bone screws are disposed at varying angles that are more tangential to the articular surface to prevent loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction, and/or prevent penetration of the bone screws through the articular surface of the humeral head.

[0010] It is understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and exemplary only, and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0011] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention. Together with the description, they serve to explain the objects, advantages and principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0021] The following description is intended to be representative only and not limiting, and many variations can be anticipated according to these teachings. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of this invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. [0022] FIGS. 1 and 2 depict the portions of a left proximal humerus generally indicated by the numeral 10. Proximal humerus 10 is joined to humeral shaft 12 ( FIG. 1 ), and includes greater tuberosity 14 , lesser tuberosity 16 , biceps groove 18 , humeral head 20 , and an articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. Biceps groove 18 is disposed between greater tuberosity 14 and lesser tuberosity 16. Thus, as depicted in FIG. 2 , greater tuberosity 14 is disposed laterally of biceps groove 18 , and lesser tuberosity 16 is disposed medially of biceps groove 18. Furthermore, in FIGS. 3-5A , lesser tuberosity 16 is partially covered by the fixation devices of the present invention. Thus, the lead line associated with numeral 16 in FIGS. 3-5A points to proximal humerus 10 adjacent where fixation devices of the present invention are positioned. [0023] As discussed above, to facilitate fracture fixation and fracture reduction, a bone plate typically has been attached to greater tuberosity 14. However, the placement of bone screws by the bone plate attached solely to greater tuberosity 14 is less than optimal. The bone screws will likely be disposed at a significantly perpendicular angle with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20 , and thus, cause a significant incidence of penetration of articular surface 22. [0024] A first embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention is generally indicated by the numeral 30 in FIGS. 3 and 3A. Fixation device 30 includes a \u201cdogleg-shaped\u201d bone plate 31 and various bone screws inserted therethrough and into bone. [0025] Bone plate 31 has a body portion 32 , a neck portion 34 , and an end portion 36. Body portion 32 includes apertures 40 spaced therealong, and is attached to humeral shaft 12 and portions of proximal humerus 10 using bone screws 41 ( FIG. 3A ) inserted through apertures 40 and into the bone. As depicted in FIGS. 3 and 3A , neck portion 34 extends from body portion 32 over biceps groove 18 , and terminates at end portion 36. End portion 36 includes apertures 42 spaced apart thereon, and is attached to lesser tuberosity 16 using bone screws 43 ( FIG. 3A ) inserted through apertures 42 and into proximal humerus 10. Apertures 40 and 42 extend between an upper surface 44 and a lower surface (not shown) of bone plate 31. The lower surface of bone plate 31 can be contoured according to the surfaces of proximal humerus 10 to provide a flush interface therebetween. [0026] Apertures 42 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 31 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 43 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 42. The angles of the longitudinal axis of apertures 42 serve to orient bone screws 43 in positions that inhibit the incidence of penetration thereof through articular surface 22. For example, the orientation angles afforded by apertures 42 serve to position bone screws 43 in at least substantially tangential orientations with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. Accordingly, the axes of apertures 42 and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 43 received therein can be oriented away from and avoid intersection with articular surface 22 , thereby decreasing the incidence of penetration of bone screws 43 through articular surface 22 , while also preventing a loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction. [0027] A second embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention is generally indicated by the numeral 50 in FIGS. 4 and 4 k Fixation device 50 includes an \u201ch-shaped\u201d bone plate 51 and various screws inserted therethrough and into bone. [0028] Bone plate 51 has a body portion 52 , a neck portion 54 , a first end portion 56 , and a second end portion 58. Body portion 52 includes apertures 60 spaced therealong, and is attached to humeral shaft 12 and portions of proximal humerus 10 using bone screws 61 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 60 and into the bone. As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 4A , first end portion 56 is contiguous with body portion 52 , and includes apertures 62 spaced apart thereon. First end portion 56 is attached to greater tuberosity 14 using bone screws 63 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 62 and into proximal humerus 10. As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 4A , neck portion 54 extends from between body portion 52 and first end portion 56 over biceps groove 18 , and terminates at second end portion 58. Second end portion 58 includes apertures 64 spaced apart thereon, and is attached to lesser tuberosity 16 using bone screws 65 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 64 and into proximal humerus 10. Apertures 60 , 62 , and 64 extend between an upper surface 66 and a lower surface (not shown) of bone plate 51. The lower surface of bone plate 51 can be contoured according to the surfaces of proximal humerus 10 to provide a flush interface therebetween. [0029] Apertures 62 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 51 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 63 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 62. As discussed below, use of second end portion 58 to facilitate attachment of bone plate 51 to proximal humerus 10 affords use of shorter bone screws 63 in apertures 62 than those typically used to secure attachment to greater tuberosity 14. [0030] Like apertures 62 , apertures 64 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 51 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 65 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 64. The angles of the axes of apertures 64 serve to orient bone screws 65 in positions that inhibit the incidence of penetration thereof through articular surface 22. For example, the orientation angles afforded by apertures 64 serve to position bone screws 65 in at least substantially tangential orientations with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. As such, the axes of apertures 64 and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 65 received therein can be oriented away from and avoid intersection with articular surface 22. Accordingly, such an orientation allows bone screws 63 inserted into lesser tuberosity 16 to share (with bone screws 63 ) in resisting the joint forces applied in a direction perpendicular to articular surface 22 , thereby decreasing the incidence of penetration of bone screws 63 through articular surface 22 , while also increasing the overall mechanical strength of the connection, preventing a loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction. [0031] Because bone plate 51 is attached using (1) first end portion 56 to greater tuberosity 14 , and (2) using second end portion 58 to lesser tuberosity 16 , bone screws 63 used with apertures 62 can be shorter than those typically used to attach a bone plate solely to greater tuberosity 14."

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention is directed to a training tool for baseball or softball. In particular, the present invention is directed to a training bat that is beneficial for improving hitting for baseball or softball. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART [0002] In baseball or softball, it is important for a hitter to hit the ball with the \u201csweet spot\u201d portion of the bat. In general, the sweet spot is considered the location of the center of percussion of the bat or the location that produces the greatest batted ball speed. While the exact location of the sweet spot depends on the characteristics of the bat, it is in general approximately six inches from the end of the barrel of the bat. The sweet spot is recognized by batters as the location that produces the least swing resistance and bat vibration, as well as the greatest power and control, when hitting the ball. Therefore, it is important for the batter to recognize the sweet spot on the bat and have a swing which consistently hits the ball with the sweet spot on the bat. [0003] To learn to recognize the sweet spot and to consistently produce such a swing, a player needs to continually practice his/her swing. Such practice creates a muscle memory which will enable the player to recreate this swing when actually batting during a game. In addition, such practice is also necessary if a batter has a flaw in his/her swing or needs to improve his/her swing. Typical drills which batters work on to improve their swing include soft toss, short batting practice, hitting off a tee, etc. However, it is important when doing such drills and practicing his/her swing, that the batter receive feedback that he/she is performing a correct swing and hitting the ball with the sweet spot of the bat. [0004] There are a variety of known training bats which aim to teach a sweet swing. Many training bats, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,415 are weighted in order to develop faster bat speed, but such bats do not help the batter to develop a repeatable swing that consistently strikes the ball with the sweet spot. Some bats have been suggested for the purpose of teaching such a repeatable swing. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,462; U.S. Pat. No. 6,923,737; U.S. patent application Publication No. 2005/0124442; and the Torpedo\u00ae training bat from Jas. D. Easton, Inc. all provide training bats which allegedly teach a batter to strike the ball with the sweet spot of the bat. For example, the Torpedo\u00ae training bat has a thin handle which stretches from a lower end to an oversized portion, the alleged sweet spot portion, near an upper end of the bat. The Torpedo\u00ae training bat, however, is entirely made of aluminum, which results in a number of problems, such as an oversized sweet spot. Further, this bat does not provide the desired performance feedback. This bat also has a relatively low bat weight. [0005] A problem to be addressed is to provide a training bat for use during drills and practice that teaches a repeatable swing that consistently strikes the ball with the sweet spot portion, while providing the batter with instant feedback during such drills and practice regarding whether the batter is hitting the ball with the sweet spot of the bat. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] In accordance with the present invention, a training bat is provided which delivers instant feedback to the hitter with regard to whether the batter is hitting the ball with the sweet spot on the bat. In a preferred embodiment, the training bat comprises a barrel attached to an elongated aluminum handle or shaft, wherein the barrel has a significantly greater diameter than the handle and is comprised of a non-metallic material. The bat has the weight and feel of a traditional aluminum bat, while the barrel resembles the size, shape, and location of the barrel and sweet spot of a traditional bat and performs similarly when used to strike a ball. [0007] Depending on whether the ball is struck by the sweet spot, the barrel, or some other portion of the bat, the batter is provided with differing feedback. For example, when the handle strikes the ball, the batter will hear a metallic \u201cping\u201d sound caused by contact between the ball and the aluminum, feel a buzz or sting in his/her hands due to the vibration of the bat, and see the ball struck weakly. In contrast, when the ball is struck by the non-metallic sweet spot, the batter will hear the \u201ccrack\u201d of the bat against the ball, feel little or no resistance and vibration, and see the ball struck solidly. This feedback is similar to that experienced during a typical game situation, but is accentuated by the configuration of the bat and teaches a repeatable swing that consistently places the sweet spot in contact with the ball. [0008] In a further preferred embodiment, the barrel is made of wood or a nylon composite while the handle is made of an airplane grade aluminum. Furthermore, the bat may be provided in an assortment of lengths, weights, and weight distributions to simulate different types and sizes of baseball and softball bats. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0009] FIG. 1 is a side view of the full length of a bat according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention; [0010] FIG. 2 is a close-up view of the barrel of the bat of FIG. 1 ; [0011] FIG. 3 is a drawing of a snap ring which can be used to connect the barrel to the handle of the bat of FIG. 1 ; [0012] FIG. 4 is a close up view of the end of the handle of the bat of FIG. 1 ; [0013] FIG. 5 is a close up view of the barrel end of a bat according to another embodiment of the present invention; and [0014] FIG. 6 is a close-up view of a logo section of the bat of FIG. 5 ; and [0015] FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a connecting location between the barrel and handle of a bat according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0016] In FIG. 1 , an embodiment of a bat 10 according to the present invention is shown. Bat 10 includes a barrel 12 , a handle 14 , a knob 16 located at a proximal end of handle 14 , a knob 18 located at a distal end of barrel 12 and a grip 20 located around a lower portion of handle 14. When used herein, the terms \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201clower\u201d are generally interchangeable and refer to a portion of the bat closer to knob 16 than a \u201cdistal\u201d or \u201cupper\u201d portion of the bat. In a preferred embodiment, the barrel 12 is generally tubular, with a hollow center through which the handle 14 may extend, as shown in FIG. 7. Preferably, the handle 14 extends substantially from a proximal end adjacent to the knob 16 , through the hollow center of the barrel 12 , to a distal end generally adjacent to knob 18. Alternatively, the barrel 12 may have a substantially solid construction, in which case the handle 14 extends upward to a proximal end of the barrel 12. As illustrated, the handle 14 has a generally constant cross-sectional area between knob 16 and barrel 12 , which area is relatively small compared to the cross-sectional areas of the barrel 12 and the knob 16. [0017] Preferably, the barrel 12 is made of a different material than the handle 14 and, in a further preferred embodiment, comprises a wood or nylon composite construction. The barrel 12 is configured to replicate the shape and location of the barrel of a traditional bat. FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of bat 10 with an alternative barrel 12 a that has a distal end 23 with a greater taper than the barrel 12 of FIGS. 1 and 2. Preferably, the barrel 12 of both embodiments has a generally tubular configuration, which allows the handle 14 to pass through a hollow central opening. The barrel 12 may be provided with a substantially solid construction, but a generally tubular configuration is preferred because it promotes an overall rigid construction and aids in aligning the various elements of the bat 10. It is also contemplated that other materials could be used for the barrel, but wood or nylon composite are most preferable because they produce a \u201ccrack\u201d sound when striking a ball, which is clearly distinguishable from the \u201cping\u201d sound of a ball struck by a handle 14 having a metallic construction. Furthermore, the different barrel material, such as wood or a nylon composite, is also preferable for safety reasons as a batted ball off a bat of the present invention will travel more slowly than a ball struck by a barrel having a metallic construction, which reduces the chance of a batted ball hitting the pitcher or another player. [0018] The barrel 12 is most preferably made of a nylon composite, because it is more durable than wood and easily provided in team colors or the like. When using wood, the barrel 12 is preferably made of maple. While other types of wood, such as ash, could be used, maple has been found to provide good feedback for letting the batter know whether he/she is hitting the ball with the sweet spot on the bat 10. [0019] In a further preferred embodiment, the barrel 12 is approximately 6\u00bd inches long and has a diameter of approximately 2\u00bd inches. In a most preferred embodiment, the barrel 12 is approximately 4 inches long and has a diameter of 2\u215b inches, which is slightly smaller than the barrel of a typical bat. The decreased size makes it more difficult to successfully strike a ball, which is useful for training purposes. However, it is contemplated that barrels having other sizes would also fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, a larger barrel may be used with a larger bat or a smaller barrel which is more difficult to strike the ball with may be used by more experienced batters to further develop their swing. [0020] Preferably, knob 18 , which is located at a distal end of barrel 12 , is made of rubber. However, other materials such as plastic or metal could also be used. As shown in FIG. 2 , knob 18 has a cylindrical body, with a generally hemispherical or convex endcap 19. It will be seen that the cylindrical body of knob 18 has a greater cross-sectional area than handle 14 and less than the exposed portion of barrel 12. Hence, knob 18 provides a region of intermediate cross-sectional area, with respect to barrel 12 and handle 14. [0021] As described above, the sweet spot of a bat is typically around six inches from the distal end of the bat, represented in FIG. 2 as a region 28 , centered between the proximal and distal ends of the barrel 12 in a preferred embodiment. Of course, the length and location of barrel 12 may be varied, such that the sweet spot region 28 accounts for a greater or smaller portion of the barrel 12 or is moved away from the center of barrel 12. In one embodiment, barrel 12 is configured such that its boundaries coincide with the boundaries of the sweet spot region 28 , i.e., barrel 12 is the sweet spot. [0022] While the region of a traditional bat between the sweet spot and the distal end of the bat, generally shown in broken lines in FIG. 5 at 30 , may be used to strike a ball, such a hit will result in discomfort in the hands due to bat vibration and the ball will be hit with diminished power and control. Accordingly, bat 10 of the present invention mimics this phenomenon by providing knob 18 which cannot be used to successfully strike a ball and which generates different feedback, compared to the feedback from the sweet spot 28. This provides the batter with immediate feedback that his/her swing is missing the sweet spot of the bat. Alternatively, bat 10 may be provided without knob 18 , but it is preferable to include knob 18 for training purposes, as well as for securing the barrel 12 and for aesthetic purposes. Further, endcap 19 of knob 18 also protects the barrel 12 from damage and wear if the distal end of the bat 10 contacts the ground or any other surface. [0023] As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 5 , in one embodiment, barrel 12 is fastened to the other portions of the bat 10 at a lower end and an upper end, generally corresponding to the location of coverings 24. Preferably, the barrel 12 is permanently affixed with an adhesive, such as an epoxy, but it may instead be fastened to handle 14 and knob 18 by mechanical means, such as a plurality of snap rings 22 , which can be seen in FIG. 7. Preferably, snap rings 22 are made of steel or another type of metal. Plastic or rubber could also be used. More preferably, snap rings 22 are made of a low carbon steel. An example of such a ring is shown in FIG. 3. The ring in FIG. 3 has a \u215e inch shaft and is distributed by Endries Fastener &amp; Supply in Wisconsin. Similar snap-rings can be found elsewhere, even at most local hardware stores. Other types of fastening mechanisms can also be used to fasten the barrel 12 to the handle 14. [0024] The ends of barrel 12 and adhesive or snap rings 22 are preferably covered by a covering 24. Preferably, covering 24 has an accordion shape and is made of rubber or plastic. [0025] In the embodiment of FIG. 5 , barrel 12 a is tapered downward at region 23 on the distal end of the barrel towards covering 24. This provides the batter with further feedback on hitting the sweet spot of the bat. In particular, if the batter hits the ball at region 23 , he will feel and hear the ball hit the nylon composite material or wood in an odd manner. He will not hear and feel the same thing as if he hit the sweet spot. As a result, the batter will know he is hitting the ball too close to the end of the bat. The proximal end of the barrel 12 a is slightly tapered, but not nearly as much as the distal end, so as to better approximate the feel of a bat and so that the batter will be able to tell when he is hitting the ball with the distal end of the barrel or the proximal end. It is more desirable to miss the sweet spot and hit with proximal end of the barrel than the distal end as the proximal end will produce greater power and control. [0026] Preferably, handle 14 is made of aluminum, though other metals can also be used. In the preferred embodiment, handle 14 is made of an airplane grade aluminum that provides the bat 10 with the balance and feel of a traditional aluminum bat. A specification for an example of such an aluminum which can be used for the handle 14 of the bat 10 of the present application is attached as Table 1. Baseball bats and softball bats are balanced differently, so the weight distribution of the handle 14 may vary in order to reproduce the proper feel. In one embodiment, the diameter of the handle 14 is approximately \u215e inch, but can be larger or smaller depending on the size of the bat 10. [0027] A traditional bat has a tapered region between the handle and barrel, which region is shown in broken lines in FIG. 5 at 36. While this region may be used to strike a ball, it will result in discomfort in the hands due to bat vibration, the ball will be hit with diminished power and control, and there is the possibility that it could break, splinter or crack the bat. As a result, it is undesirable to hit the ball with this portion of the bat. In order to emphasize this, bat 10 mimics and magnifies this problem by providing an elongated handle 14 which cannot be used to successfully strike a ball and which generates different feedback, compared to the feedback from the sweet spot 28 of the bat. Additionally, aluminum bats are stronger than wood bats, and a ball which is struck by the tapered region 36 of an aluminum bat can often result in a successful hit, whereas a ball striking a wooden bat in a similar location will frequently shatter the bat. As a result, it is difficult for many players to make the transition from aluminum to wooden bats, because they can no longer rely on the tapered region 36 to successfully strike the ball. Bat 10 of the present invention essentially removes the tapered region 36 , thereby forcing the batter to use the barrel 12 of the bat to successfully strike the ball. While the illustrated handle 14 has a generally constant cross-sectional diameter between knob 16 and barrel 12 , it may instead be provided with a varying cross-sectional diameter. However, as explained above, it is preferred to provide this exposed portion of handle 14 with a generally uniform, relatively narrow profile in order to maximize the usefulness of the bat 10 for practice and training exercises. [0028] Knob 16 is preferably made of the same material as handle 14 and preferably welded to the end of handle 14. Knob 16 is not limited to being made of aluminum but could also be made, for example, of plastic, rubber or other types of metal."

  "query": "How does the intravascular stent deployment system reduce the likelihood of stent slippage and ensure uniform expansion?,",
  "negative": "The invention pertains to a vascular implant system utilizing a catheter with an innovative balloon design that enables a self-expanding scaffold to be placed within bodily conduits. The catheter apparatus comprises a centrally located tube with an attached balloon at its tip, upon which a stent is secured. The balloon possesses a series of embossed contours that align with the architectural elements of the stent over a segment of its span. These embossed forms are meticulously crafted to engage with the stent, diminishing the risk of axial movement and fostering evenly distributed expansion during deployment. Alternative designs may include a balloon coated with a high-friction polymeric substance, surpassing the tackiness of the base balloon material. This enhanced surface may be achieved through an application of a friction-enhancing polymeric layer atop the prefabricated balloon or by executing a coextrusion method with a high-friction polymer enveloping the primary balloon material.

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an intravascular stent deployment system and method of manufacture and more particularly to a catheter balloon for stent delivery with the stent impression being heatset into the balloon thereby forming ridges to match the stent and/or with a high friction balloon surface. The ridges and/or high friction surface hold the stent in place a longitudinally permitting more uniform expansion of the stent and reducing the likelihood of the stent slipping along the balloon, inadvertently dislodging or snagging. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is used to reduce arterial build-up of cholesterol fats or atherosclerotic plaque. Typically a first guidewire of about 0.038 inches in diameter is steered through the vascular system to the site of therapy. A guiding catheter, for example, can then be advanced over the first guidewire. The first guidewire is then removed. A balloon catheter on a smaller 0.014 inch diameter guidewire is advanced within the guiding catheter to a point just proximal to the stenosis. The second guidewire is advanced into the stenosis, followed by the balloon at the distal end of the catheter. The balloon is then inflated causing the site of the stenosis to compress into the arterial wall. The dilatation of the occlusion, however, can form flaps, fissures and dissections which threaten re-closure of the dilated vessel or even perforations in the vessel wall. Implantation of a metal stent can provide support for such flaps and dissections and thereby prevent reclosure of the vessel or provide a patch repair for a perforated vessel wall until corrective surgery can be performed. Reducing the possibility of restenosis after angioplasty reduces the likelihood that a secondary angioplasty procedure or a surgical bypass operation will be necessary. An implanted prosthesis such as a stent can preclude additional procedures and maintain vascular patency by mechanically supporting dilated vessels to prevent vessel collapse. Stents can also be used to repair aneurysms, to support artificial vessels as liners of vessels or to repair dissections. Stents are suited to the treatment of any body lumen, including the vas deferens, ducts of the gallbladder, prostate gland, trachea, bronchus and liver. The body lumens range in size from the small coronary vessels to the 28 mm aortic vessel. The invention applies to acute and chronic closure or reclosure of body lumens. A typical stent is a cylindrically shaped wire formed device intended to act as a permanent prosthesis. A stent is deployed in a body lumen from a radially compressed configuration into a radially expanded configuration which allows it to contact and support a body lumen. The stent can be made to be radially self-expanding or expandable by the use of an expansion device. The self expanding stent is made from a resilient springy material while the device expandable stent is made from a material which is plastically deformable. A plastically deformable stent can be implanted during a single angioplasty procedure by using a balloon catheter bearing a stent which has been crimped onto the balloon. Stents radially expand as the balloon is inflated, forcing the stent into contact with the body lumen thereby forming a supporting relationship with the vessel walls. The biocompatable metal stent props open blocked coronary arteries, keeping them from reclosing after balloon angioplasty. A balloon of appropriate size and pressure is first used to open the lesion. The process is repeated with a stent crimped on a balloon. The stent is deployed when the balloon is inflated. The stent remains as a permanent scaffold after the balloon is withdrawn. U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,062 to Wiktor for &#34;Intravascular Radially Expandable Stent and Method of Implant&#34; discloses a two-dimensional zig-zag form, typically a sinusoidal form. U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,495 to Osborn for &#34;Apparatus for Uniformly Implanting a Stent&#34; discloses elastic restraining bands which exert a force at the proximal and distal ends of the balloon equal and opposite to that generated by the combined resistance of the sleeve and the stent tending to deform the balloon. In this way, the uneven expansion (end effects) are limited when the balloon is expanded which, in turn, inhibits a &#34;dog boning&#34; deformation at the proximal and distal regions of the balloon. FIGS. 3-6 show a balloon of complex manufacture. European Patent No. 553,960 A1 to Lau for &#34;Protective membrane for Stent-carrying Balloon Catheter&#34; discloses a stent mounted on a tubular sheath having an outer surface composed of a high coefficient of friction material designed to secure the stent until balloon inflation. Copending U.S. Ser. No. 08/637,959 to Rupp et al. discloses a balloon catheter for stent delivery with the catheter inner lumen tube having a greater outer diameter for a central portion of the area covered by the stent thereby permitting more uniform expansion of the stent. As stent metal mass increases in stents having elements that can expand independently in the longitudinal direction, there is a tendency towards longitudinal compression at the center of the stent when expanded. The increased metal mass creates more radial hoop strength which in turn increases the amount of force required to expand the stent. The center of the stent has more radial hoop strength than the ends of the stent. As a result, the balloon expands first at the distal and proximal ends before expanding at the center. This creates a dumbbell shaped balloon. With the stent ends expanding first, the stent slides down the expanded balloon ends toward the center of the balloon which is as yet unexpanded because of the stent&#39;s greater radial hoop strength in the center. When the balloon ends have expanded completely, the deployed stent may be compressed to length that is significantly shorter than desired. Because the stent is compressed toward the center of the balloon, complete balloon expansion may not be possible. Due to the nature of the PTCA procedure, as well as handling prior to the procedure, there exists a potential for inadvertent dislodgment of the stent caused by slippage of the stent along the deflated balloon. Bare stenting without a stent sheath presents the additional problem of the stent snagging upon luminal calcification. What is needed is a method of stent deployment which results in uniform stent expansion and reduces the likelihood of the stent slipping along the balloon, inadvertently dislodging or snagging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a catheter system for implanting a radially expandable stent which reduces longitudinal stent slippage during stent expansion, reduces snagging during insertion and permits uniform radial stent expansion. The present invention is accomplished by providing an intravascular catheter system and method of manufacture for implanting a radially expandable stent within a body vessel. The catheter system comprises a shaft defining an inflation lumen in fluid communication with a balloon on the distal end of the shaft. A stent is coaxially mounted on the balloon. The balloon has ridges impressed in the outline of the stent for at least a portion of the stent. The ridges are sized to receive the stent so a s to reduce stent slippage and cause the balloon to expand evenly and the stent to deploy uniformly. In an alternative embodiment the balloon may additionally have a polymeric surface layer over an underlying material. The surface layer having a higher coefficient of friction than the underlying layer. The surface layer may be provided as a high friction polymeric coating on a formed balloon or as a coaxial extrusion of a high friction polymeric material over the underlying balloon tubing material. In a further embodiment the balloon may have the polymeric surface layer but without the ridges.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Refer to FIG. 1 showing a side elevation overall view of a Medtronic Wiktor stent 20 fitted over a longitudinal cross section of a deflated balloon 35. The Wiktor stent 20 is formed with a wire which is formed into zig-zags such as a sinusoidal wave form helix pattern the length of the stent by a means such as passing the wire through gears such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,153,936 issued to Owens et al. The zig-zags are formed by alternate peaks 25 and valleys 30. The zig-zags are canted toward the proximal and distal ends of the stent 20. The zig-zags form a plurality of spaced-apart elements 40a-f each extending 360 degrees around the hollow cylinder. Each of the elements 40a-f has a plurality of extendible portions such as the zig-zags which permit the wire elements 40a-f to be expanded from an unexpanded diameter as seen in FIG. 1 to a second, expanded diameter as seen in FIG. 2. A wire having formed zig-zags is wound around a forming mandrel to create the cylindrical stent shape. After the stent has been reduced to the objective outer diameter by compressing it on successively smaller mandrels, the proximal and distal ends of the wire segment are attached. The means of attachment may include looping 50 the end segments together, twisting, biocompatible adhesive, brazing, welding or stamping. For coronary applications, the stent 20 wire can have a diameter of about 0.001 inches to about 0.015 inches. The balloon expandable stent can be made of an inert, biocompatible material with high corrosion resistance that can be plastically deformed at low-moderate stress levels such as tantalum, the preferred embodiment. Other acceptable materials include stainless steel, titanium ASTM F63-83 Grade 1, niobium or high carat gold K 19-22. A self-expanding device can be made by the use of superelastic nickel titanium (NiTi) such as Nitinol manufactured by Raychem or Forukawa. The preferred form of the sinusoidal wave of the stent wire for coronary applications is a length of about 0.150 inches to about 0.090 inches and a wave amplitude of between about 0.050 inches and about 0.080 inches. Any wave length and amplitude combination that would provide adequate vessel hoop strength and vessel coverage is appropriate. The stent of this invention and balloon can be transported via a standard #7 or 8 French guiding catheter. Once on location, the stent can be expanded radially by the expansion of the balloon 35; a ratio of 2.75:1 can be achieved with a wire diameter of approximately 0.005 inches and an initial stent diameter of approximately 0.060 inches. As seen in FIG. 1, the stent 20 is centrally located and positioned with respect to the length of balloon 35. The stent 20 turns are evenly spaced so that when the stent 20 is expanded the stent 20 will provide even support inside the vessel and resist external loading. The stent 20 must expand evenly and permit the balloon 35 to expand evenly. The Wiktor stent is formed of a hollow cylindrical wire winding having a plurality of spaced-apart circumferential elements 40a-f. Each element 40a-f extends 360 degrees around the hollow cylinder such that the elements 40a-f can move longitudinally as the stent 20 is expanded. Each of the elements 40a-f has a plurality of extendible portions 25, 30 which permit the wire elements 40a-f to be expanded. Each peak 25 and valley 30 pair comprises a wave. To achieve greater coverage, metal mass can be increased in a sinusoidal wave form stent 20 by having more waves per revolution, as for example, increasing from four waves to six waves. Stents such as that shown in FIG. 1 having elements 40a-f can expand independently in the longitudinal direction and can present special problems not presented by stents formed of a solid cylinder. As stent metal mass increases in stents with extendible portions, there is a tendency towards longitudinal compression at the center of the stent when expanded. The increased metal mass creates more radial hoop strength which in turn increases the amount of force required to expand the stent 20. The center of the stent has more radial hoop strength than the ends of the stent 20. The balloon expands first at the distal and proximal ends before expanding the center which is covered by the stent. This creates a dumbbell shaped balloon. With the stent ends expanding first, the stent slides down the expanded balloon ends toward the center of the balloon which is as yet unexpanded because of the stent&#39;s increased radial hoop strength in the center. As the proximal and distal ends of the balloon expand to approximately two-thirds of normal expansion diameter, the mid-section of the balloon begins to expand. When the balloon ends have expanded completely, the stent may have been compressed to approximately one-half of its original crimped length. This type of balloon inflation seems to act as a moving &#34;snow plow&#34; forcing the stent to slide and contract longitudinally along the balloon. The resulting deployed stent may be tightly bunched, misshapen and significantly shorter than a properly deployed stent. Because the stent is compressed toward the center of the balloon, complete balloon expansion may not be possible. To prevent the dumbbell effect as well as reducing the chance of stent dislodgment or snagging, the stent may be embedded into the wrapped balloon and/or the balloon surface may be modified in order to increase the coefficient of friction to the point that the forces involved in the longitudinal slippage or inadvertent dislodgment of the stent would not be able to overcome the friction force. The force required to dislodge the stent 20 is therefore increased. If a stent dislodges from the catheter, it could be carried away into the blood stream with serious consequences to the patient. Bare stenting without a stent sheath presents the additional problem of the stent snagging upon luminal calcification. Recessing 53 the stent reduces stent profile and the likelihood of snagging. The stent can be embedded either directly into the balloon as seen in FIG. 3 or into an external polymeric surface layer 110 as seen in FIG. 4. This can be done by using a heat chamber 75, a crimper 85/100 or a probe 95. When the balloon 35 is expanded to deploy the stent 20, the ridges 55, 57 created by the heated stent 20 hold the stent 20 in place longitudinally and allow the stent to expand without significantly shortening. For any of these methods the balloon 35 must first be wrapped then optionally heatset in any conventional manner. To wrap the balloon 35 as shown in FIG. 5, the following procedure can be used. For coronary applications, begin with a 0.0160 inch diameter heat set mandrel. A heat set mandrel is TEFLON\u00ae coated as opposed to a stainless steal mandrel, for example. TEFLON\u00ae does not stick and makes the mandrel easier to remove. TEFLON\u00ae, a form of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is available from E.I Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, Wilmington, Del. Next attach the catheter inflation port to the vacuum manifold. Insert the 10-30 cm mandrel into the distal end of the catheter leaving approximately 10-20 mm of the mandrel extending from the distal tip of the balloon. Deflate the balloon using a vacuum. Fold the balloon so that it wraps evenly around the guidewire tube in an &#34;S&#34; folding pattern as seen in FIG. 5. With vacuum applied and the balloon 35 folded, slide a heat set sleeve over the balloon to hold the balloon in place. Insert the distal end of the catheter into a heat chamber. A heat chamber 75 such as that shown in FIG. 7 can be made in any conventional mater as for example, by utilizing an insulated chamber with a time and temperature controller. Apply heat of 75 degrees F. (1 degree C.) for 10 minutes under a vacuum of a minimum of 24 inches Hg. Allow the balloon to cool for 5 minutes then remove it from the heat chamber and disconnect from the vacuum source. The stent 20 can then be crimped upon the wrapped and heatset balloon 35 either manually or with an appropriate tool. Once the balloon 35 is wrapped, optionally heatset, and has had the stent 20 crimped about it, the balloon 35 and stent 20 may be placed into a heater block type of heat chamber 75 such as that shown in FIG. 7. The heat chamber 75 can be one or two pieces and may be made of aluminum. The chamber 75 inside diameter is less than the outside diameter of the wrapped balloon 35 with stent 20 crimped thereon. The chamber 75 is in contact with the stent 20 thereby heating the stent wire 20 which becomes slightly embedded into the balloon 35. As seen in FIGS. 3 and 6, this creates ridges 55, 57 in the balloon 35 which match the stent 20. An alternative method for embedding the stent 20 into the balloon 35 can be used during the final crimping sequence. This procedure utilizes a crimping device as seen in FIGS. 8 or 10 or a probe as seen in FIG."

  "query": "What novel composition and method does the invention propose for the production of a multi-purpose repair material for abdominal wall hernia?,",
  "negative": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to the area of medical devices, focusing on a novel composite material for bone fracture repair. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART Bone fractures often require surgical intervention and stabilization using implants. Traditional implants are typically made from metals such as stainless steel or titanium. These metal implants, while providing strength, can lead to stress shielding wherein the bone around the implant loses density. Hybrid composites have been proposed that combine metallic elements with biodegradable polymers. However, such composites have limitations in terms of biocompatibility and load-bearing capacity. Moreover, they can cause inflammation and are not ideal for all surgical applications. There is a need for improvement in the materials used for bone repair that can promote osteointegration and reduce long-term complications. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To address these issues, the invention seeks to provide a novel composite material specifically engineered for bone repair. The composite includes a biodegradable framework blended with calcium phosphate nanoparticles. The framework is designed to support bone growth while gradually degrading over time, leaving no long-term foreign material in the body. The calcium phosphate acts as an osteoconductive agent, enhancing the healing process. The resulting composite is intended to be more biocompatible, promote faster healing and bone integration, and reduce incidence of inflammatory responses compared to existing solutions. The invention represents a step forward in medical technology, providing an improved material for bone fracture repair that offers clear benefits over traditional implants and current composite materials. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying figures illustrate the compressive strength of the novel composite material compared to pure polymer and metal implants. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In the preferred embodiment, the biodegradable framework is a blend of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), which provides an optimized balance between mechanical strength and degradation rate. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles, with sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nanometers, are uniformly dispersed throughout the composite. The composite can be molded into various geometric shapes to maximize efficacy depending on the location and nature of the bone fracture. Clean room conditions and strict sterile processing are employed in the production of the material to maintain its purity and ensure safety for surgical application. The invention thus provides a new and advantageous alternative for bone repair surgeries, aiming to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.\n\n",

BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of Invention [0003] The present invention relates to a technical field of medical consumables, and more particularly to a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0004] 2. Description of Related Arts [0005] Hernia is a fascial defect in structure. For example, an organ or part of the organ, or a tissue or part of the tissue is able to be extended through the fascial defect of an abdominal wall. Commonly, the hernia structurally comprises weakened, bulged or actually torn fascia of an organ or a tissue. There are many types of hernias. For example, if happening to a lower abdominal area, the hernia often contains intra-abdominal contents such as intestines or other tissues which enter or pass through the abdominal wall defect. Mesh patch is widely used in hernia repair. Conventionally, widely used patches are polyester meshes (such as Dacron and Mersilene), and polypropylene meshes (such as Marlex, Prolene, etc.). However, a simple non-degradable mesh is not suitable for intra-peritoneal implantation, because organ adhesions may occur with the patch, leading to serious complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, intestinal fistula, intestinal obstruction, etc. A common solution is inserting a physical barrier at a position where adhesions are undesirable. However, this barrier leads to connecting problems in the interior of the barrier, because if the barrier is prepared by a non-absorbable material, the barrier itself becomes an adhesion source; if the barrier is absorbable, absorption must be non-inflammatory, for not leading to self-adhesion. [0006] The ePTFE developed by Gore Company is an adhesion layer resistance product (Gore-Tex\u00ae Surgical Membrane), which provides effective tissue separation. However, the material is easy to cause infection, and must be removed through a second surgery after infection. In addition, due to a high material shrinkage rate, mesothelial cells are not able to grow into the material, so it is difficult to form a new peritoneum (Harrell A G, Novitsky Y W, Peindl R D, et al. Prospective evaluation of adhesion formation and shrinkage of intra-abdominal prosthetics in a rabbit model Am Surg 2006, 72: 808-14.). [0007] International patent WO2009079271A2 discloses a Proceed multi-layer mesh developed by American Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, wherein the multi-layer mesh comprises a polypropylene mesh layer, a poly-dioxanone layer (PDS) and an oxidized regenerated cellulose membrane layer (ORC). A composite method thereof comprises directly thermal-pressing an ORC knitted mesh having a certain moisture content with a PDS membrane and a polypropylene mesh, and increasing binding forces between different layers with the moisture content. However, a sample prepared by the method is easy to be separated, wherein the layers of the sample are able to be separated by a tensile testing machine, and softness thereof is poor, which means a compliance with the abdominal wall needs to be improved. As a result, there will be a strong foreign body sensation after implantation. [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,032B1 discloses a Parietex mesh of Tyco Company, comprising a mesh woven by polyethylene terephthalate yarn, composite collagen, polyethylene glycol and glycerin; wherein a collagen solution is oxidized by periodic acid for self-crosslinking, and forms a first layer with the polyethylene glycol and the glycerol; a second layer is basically the same as the first layer. The first layer and the second layer are composited with the polyethylene terephthalate mesh for achieving multi-layer composite. According to the method, chemical reactions are involved and strong oxidizing agents are used. Furthermore, direct binding between the mesh and natural macromolecule collagen which is difficult to form a membrane is not stable. [0009] Chinese patent CN101035574A and international patent WO 2005105172A1 both disclose a Sepramesh mesh developed by BARD Company, which is a double-layer mesh woven by polypropylene yarn and polyglycolic acid yarn. The double-layer is formed by immersing a polyglycolic acid layer in a modified hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose solution and a modified polyethylene glycol solution, wherein the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose is crosslinked by a carbodiimide type crosslinking agent; a polyethylene glycol derivative is acrylate-terminated; and polymerization in the solution is initiated by light. Preparation of the product involves a lot of chemical reactions, which is complex and greatly increases manufacturing costs during production. [0010] The above mentioned products have problems such as complicated preparation processes, a lot of chemical reactions, layers which are easy to be separated, poor softness and controversial anti-adhesion effects, and prices of the above products are very high. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0011] For overcoming the above technical problems in the conventional technologies, an object of the present invention is to provide a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0012] Accordingly, the repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia comprises an absorbable membrane, wherein the absorbable membrane is prepared with a mixed solution of a PLCL and an MPEG-PLLA copolymer. [0013] The PLCL is an L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer, wherein in the L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer, a mole ratio between L-lactide and caprolactone is 50:50-90:10; and an intrinsic viscosity of the L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer at 25\u00b0 C. is 1.0-2.5 dl/g. [0014] The MPEG-PLLA copolymer, a molecular weight of MPEG is 2000-10000, and a molecular weight of PLLA is 3000-8000. Preferably, the molecular weight of the MPEG is 2000-5000, and the molecular weight of the PLLA is 5000-6000. [0015] A mole ratio between the PLCL and the MPEG-PLLA copolymer in the mixed solution is 5:5-7:3. [0016] The repair material comprises a polypropylene mesh with an absorbable coating thereon, and the absorbable membrane press-fitted on the polypropylene mesh; the absorbable coating is formed by applying the mixed solution of the PLCL and the MPEG-PLLA copolymer to the polypropylene mesh. [0017] A density of the polypropylene mesh is 20-80 g/m 2 , and a thickness thereof is 1-5 mm. Preferably, the density of the polypropylene mesh is 20-50 g/m 2 , the thickness thereof is 1-3 mm; and a single hole area of the polypropylene mesh is 3-20 mm 2. [0018] The absorbable membrane has a drainage hole thereon. [0019] The present invention also provides a method for preparing a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0020] The method comprises steps of: [0021] (1) immersing a polypropylene mesh into a mixed solution for forming an absorbable coating on a surface of the polypropylene mesh after being dried; [0022] (2) pouring the mixed solution into a mould, statically evaporating for obtaining an absorbable membrane; and [0023] (3) press-fitting the polypropylene mesh obtained in the step (1) to the absorbable membrane and statically evaporating; [0024] wherein the mixed solution is a mixed solution of a PLCL and an MPEG-PLLA copolymer. [0025] The repair material of the present invention is suitable for abdominal wall defects due to incisional hernia, parastomal hernia, umbilical hernia, inguinal hernia and peritoneal tumor resection, and is applicable to intra-abdominal hernia repair of abdominal wall hernia and the abdominal wall defects, as well as laparoscopic inguinal hernia. Compared with the prior art, the present invention has beneficial effects as follows. [0026] Compared with the PLCL, the repair material of the present invention is significantly improved in water absorption of the absorbable membrane. A material rigidity is lowered to ameliorate healing effects, and a contact angle is greatly reduced. As a result, postoperative abdominal wall compliance is sufficient, which basically provides no discomfort. Therefore, compared with the PLCL, the present invention is more comfortable. In addition, in the repair material of the present invention, polypropylene is completely fitted with the absorbable membrane, wherein no obvious boundary face is observed through a microscope, and separation never occurred. [0027] These and other objectives, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0038] Referring to the drawings, a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia of the present invention is further illustrated, for helping persons skilled in the art to completely, accurately and thoroughly understand inventive ideas and technical schemes of the present invention. [0039] In a field of hernia repair materials, PLCL, MPEG and PLLA have certain meanings. In the field, the PLCL is a lactide/caprolactone copolymer; the MPEG is methoxypolyethylene glycols, and the PLLA is poly L-lactic acid. For example, MPEG2000 illustrates methoxypolyethylene glycols with a molecular weight of 2000, and PLLA6000 illustrates poly L-lactic acid with a molecular weight of 6000; MPEG5000 illustrates methoxypolyethylene glycols with a molecular weight of 5000, and PLLA5000 illustrates poly L-lactic acid with a molecular weight of 5000. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the PLCL and the MPEG-PLLA copolymer are commercially available. According to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the PLCL is an L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer, wherein a mole ratio between L-lactide and caprolactone is 50:50, and an intrinsic viscosity thereof at 25\u00b0 C. is 1.0-1.5 dl/g.

No. 5,725,471; the U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/023,421, filed Aug. 15, 1996; the PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997; the U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 6,132,361, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/345,572, all the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application is also related to the U.S. non-provisional application Ser. No. 09/501,457 entitled Placebo Seat for Incontinence-Related Magnetic Stimulation Research filed Feb. 10, 2000, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for simulating the sounds and vibrations of a genuine magnetic nerve stimulator, in the preferred version, a transcranial magnetic stimulator (\u201cTMS\u201d), while reducing the induced current for the device from reaching the patient. The present invention relates to a sham TMS which presents the appearance, noise, apparatus, etc. of a genuine TMS, but which, in fact, may be used as a placebo in clinical studies to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of the genuine magnetic nerve stimulator or TMS. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION TMS is well known in the art. Magnetic stimulation realizes the electric fields necessary for the charge transfer by induction. Magnetic stimulation may be used to induce electric fields in biologic tissue. Rapidly changing magnetic fields induce electric fields in biologic tissue, and when the proper rates, intensity, depth of penetration are achieved, the magnetically induced electric field accomplishes transferring charge directly into the neuron to be excited. TMS involves the magnetic stimulation of neurons in the brain and has been used in the localization, characterization and treatment of brain function. TMS is known to non-invasively alter the function of the cerebral cortex. (See e.g. George M S, Wasserman E M, Post Rm, Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A neuropsychiatric tool for the 21 st century, J. Neuropsychiatry, 1996 8:373-382 , the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference). The magnetic fields used in transcranial magnetic stimulation are generally generated by large, rapidly-changing currents passing through a wire coil on the scalp. Use of a coil with a ferro magnetic core of a material with a saturability of at least 0.5 tesla has been found to be very effective. Two recent studies have suggested that rapid rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be used for exploring the functional neuroanatomy of emotions: emotionally healthy volunteers who received left pre-frontal stimulation reported an increase in self-rated sadness, while, in contrast, right pre-frontal stimulation to similarly healthy volunteers caused an increase in happiness. (See, Pascual-Leone A., Catala M D, Pascual A P, Lateralized effect of rapid rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex on mood, Neurology, 1996; 46: 499-502; and, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W., et al., Changes in mood and hormone levels after rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 172-180, the disclosures of which are also fully incorporated herein by reference.) Other reports have begun to delineate the therapeutic use of rTMS in depression. The earliest such studies used round, non-focal coils centered at the cranial vertex, with stimulation rates well under 1 Hertz (Hz). Results were promising but not always statistically significant. (See, Hoflich G., Kasper S. Hufnagel A. et al., Application of transcranial magnetic stimulation in treatment of drug-resistant major depression: a report of two cases, Human Psychopharmacology, 1993; 8: 361-365; Grisaru N., Yarovslavsky U., Abarbanel J., et al., Transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression and schizophrenia, Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1994; 4: 287-288; and, Kilbinger H M, Hofilich G., Hufnagel A., et al., Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the treatment of major depression: A pilot study, Human Psychopharmacology, 1995; 10: 305-310, the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.) Subsequently, George et al., described a striking improvement in some depressed patients from the treatment with rTMS over the left pre-frontal cortex. (See, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W A, et al., Daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves mood in depression, NeuroReport, 1995; 6: 1853-1856; and, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W E, Kimbrell T A, Little J T, Halleft M., Post R M, Daily left prefrontal rTMS improves mood in outpatient depression: a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, Am. J. Psychiatry, 1997 (in press), the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference). A large study was reported by Pascual-Leone et al., who used a five-month double blind placebo-controlled cross-over design with five different treatment conditions. (See, Pascual-Leone A., Rubio B., Pallardo F. Catala M D, Rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in drug-resistant depression, The Lancet, 1996; 348: 233-237, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.) Left pre-frontal rTMS was uniquely effective in 11 of 17 young (less than 60 years of age) psychotically depressed and medication resistant patients. A recently developed TMS was disclosed by the present applicant and Charles M. Epstein in the PCT International Application NO. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997. That disclosure is therefore specifically incorporated herein by reference. The TMS studies have demonstrated a need for a sham TMS, which may be used as a placebo, to provide a control to determine the effectiveness of a device genuinely providing TMS. There is a need for a sham TMS which can be effectively used in placebo-controlled TMS blind studies. Accordingly, it is a goal of the present invention to provide a sham apparatus for transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may be used in placebo-controlled blind studies to further investigate the uses and effectiveness of TMS in the treatment of patients. Such a sham device must simulate, as much as practicable, the apparatus under investigation, while shielding the induced current of the device from reaching the patient, especially since the studies are related to ephemeral concepts, e.g., self-perception, depression, etc. concepts which are difficult to accurately measure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for imitating the external appearance, sounds and vibration of a genuine TMS while keeping low the induced current which is actually transmitted to the patient. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a sham TMS which may be used as a placebo in studies to determine the effectiveness of a TMS apparatus and/or procedural protocol under investigation. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for realistically simulating a TMS, to be used as a control in legitimate and verifiable medical studies. As disclosed more fully hereafter, a method and an apparatus is described for realistically simulating a TMS wherein the induced current reaching the patient is kept to a very small percentage of the functioning core which is not provided with the sham shroud. The apparatus placebo comprises the genuine TMS device, modified however, such that an aluminum shroud is situated over the core&#39;s end faces. The aluminum plate absorbs a significant amount of the transmitted energy from the TMS, thus substantially keeping the induced current from penetrating to the patient who is receiving the TMS placebo treatment and/or device. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The apparatus of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing figures, in which: FIG. 1 is a side view of a core segment of a transcranial magnetic brain stimulator, shown without the aluminum shroud of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a front view of a core segment of the transcranial magnetic brain stimulator shown in FIG. 1, again without the aluminum shroud of the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The design of the invention is related to the design for a functioning or operational TMS as previously described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/345,572 filed Nov. 28, 1994 (the continuation of which is pending) and in PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997, the disclosures of which are all fully incorporated herein by reference. Also incorporated by reference is U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,471, issued to Neotonus, Inc. which describes a preferred form of a magnetic nerve stimulator. Drawings relating to operational magnetic stimulators are provided in FIGS. 1 through 4. The specifications and details of the components of an operational stimulator are set forth in the PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,471. In one operational magnetic nerve stimulator, the stimulator may induce electric fields similar in distribution to those from a Cadwell water-cooled figure-eight coil. As shown in FIG. 1, in an operational magnetic stimulator, a core ( 27 ) for the magnetic nerve stimulator is provided for stimulation of the brain. The stimulator core 27 is made of a magnetic material, preferably a ferromagnetic material. The stimulator core segment is basically hemispherical and terminates with two rectangular end faces ( 2 ), as shown in FIG. 4 Preferred materials for the core of an operational magnetic stimulator include vanadium permendur or 3% grain oriented steel. As shown in FIG. 1, an example of the core of an operational magnetic stimulator, core segment 27 is cut from an oval winding of 2 mil vanadium permendur. Two core segments can, in fact, be cut from a single oval winding, by cutting one core from each side of the oval. For illustration purposes, only a single core segment is shown in the diagram of FIG. 1. A method of construction of such a core is as described previously in the patent application, which is related to the present application, U.S. application Ser. No. 08/345,572, filed Nov. 28, 1994 and the continuation thereof. Cores may be constructed from thin laminate, highly saturable material (i.e. materials with a saturability of at least 1.5-2.0 Tesla, although less saturable materials with a saturability of 0.5 Tesla and higher can be used as well). A typical core can be made by winding two mil stock of vanadium permendur. A long ribbon of such material is wound on a mandrel (e.g. a mandrel of wood or plastic) for the radius, thickness and depth desired. Each side of the ribbon is coated with a thin insulative coating to electrically isolate it from its neighbor. After cutting the core segment 27 from the entire oval winding, a suitable core might span a preferred angle of approximately 208\u00b0, or in the range of about 205-215\u00b0. Other angles are possible, as well. Once the ribbon has been wound on the mandrel to the desired dimensions, it is dipped in epoxy to freeze its position. Once the epoxy has dried, the mandrel is removed and the core segments may be cut for the span of angle desired. The cut may destroy the electrical isolation of adjacent laminations. Each cut foil then must be finely ground so that it is smooth, and then a deep etch is performed. The deep etch is performed by dipping each of the cut ends in an acid bath. This causes the cut ends to slightly delaminate, but maintains the electrical isolation of the laminations. Failure to perform this deep etch seems to result in considerable eddy current loss and heating at the cut ends of the core segments. Following the deep etch, the ends are brushed with epoxy to maintain the shape and structural integrity of the core segment. The final step of the construction of an operational magnetic stimulator is to wind a coil of insulated wire about the one or more, side by side core segments. A typical inductance for a core of this type is about 20 \u03bcH. The operational magnetic stimulators however, may be practiced at other inductances or magnetic field strengths, if desired. As an alternative to cutting the core segment as a single section, the core can be first cut into a semi-circular section. In this method of manufacture, small triangular sections or wedges 34 at the bottom of the core are then cut separately, and attached to the semi-circular section as shown in FIG. 1. The smaller triangles may also be made from vanadium permendur. If necessary, however, the triangles can be any material or alloy that has a saturation of at least 0.5 Tesla. A suitable alloy for the triangular wedge sections, for example, is 2 mil 50% nickel alloy. As shown in FIG. 1, in one example of the core for an operational transcranial magnetic stimulator, core 27 has an outer diameter of approximately 4.75 inches. The core 27 has an inner semicircular aperture at the center of the core segment 27. Inner semicircle aperture has a diameter of approximately 0.75 inches. In the version where the smaller triangles are separate, triangular sections or wedges 34 are attached to the larger semi-circular section. Triangular sections 34 have a length on longer side (with respect to the shorter leg, not the hypotaenuse), in contact with semi-circular section 30 , of approximately 1.375 inches, and a length of approximately 0.75 inches on shorter side 42 which is approximately coplanar with the outside circumferential wall of the semi-circular section. As shown in FIG. 2, the cross sectional width of core segment 27 is approximately 0.625 inches and the wedges 34 are about the same thickness. As shown in FIG. 1, each of the core segments of the operational stimulator may be an open core, i.e. the core forms an open arc and does not constitute a closed toroid. An approximately C-shaped or horseshoe core is preferable. At least a portion of the core of the stimulator conforms, at least approximately, to the shape of the head. A hemispherical stimulator, having at least one, but preferably four adjacent, core segments (see FIG. 3) made of saturable or highly saturable ferromagnetic material may be used. The span of the core affects both the penetration depth of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the field. While a variety of angles are acceptable for the curvature of the arc of the core, a core of 208 degrees or approximately in the range of about 205-215 degrees (as shown in FIG. 1) is preferred and desired. Cores of approximately 190-230 degrees can be utilized. Alternatively, a core spanning an arc of approximately 180-270 degrees is also possible, although not necessarily believed as effective. To form an operational stimulator, four core segments may be positioned approximately flat side by flat side to form a complete magnetic stimulator. Although more than four core segments or less than four core segments are possible, four are preferred. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, two pairs of cores are placed side by side to form, by their open ends, a hemisphere-like opening designed for placement on a section of the head. The combined core segments are wound with a series of windings of wire to form a single functioning core component. Approximately nine to ten turns of wire may be used. In practice, it has been found that approximately nine (9) turns of wire should be wound around the larger stimulator formed of a single core segment of FIG. 1, and approximately ten (10) turns of wire should be wound around the stimulator formed of several core segments. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, approximately four-five (4-5) turns of wires are wound around each half of the stimulator, i.e., approximately four to five turns are wound around a first side or leg of the stimulator, and another four to five turns are wound around the second side or leg of the stimulator. The stimulator may be provided with a visualization and location port passing from outside circumferential wall to the inside for viewing and marking the head and locating and precisely relocating the stimulator thereon. A space is left open between the two pairs of cores to form a center port 62 (see FIG."

  "query": "What methods exist for synthesizing optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acids with antiaggregatory properties?,",
  "negative": "The present invention pertains to processes for producing synthetically derived 3-aryl-1-hydroxypentanoic acid intermediates. These compounds have been observed to display antihyperlipidemic and vasodilatory characteristics, which diverge from those of the traditional phenoxypropionic acids, as suggested in earlier studies by Corbin et al. J. Med. Chem., 1988, 31:1434-1445, and Harlow et al., Lipids, 1989, 24:25-32. Although 1-alkyl- and 1-acylpentanoic acids are commonly found in nature, the 1-hydroxy substituted system is rare and is primarily associated with the vitamin E group and its analogs. The vasodilatory functions of 3-hydroxypentanoic acid intermediates are noteworthy as they pertain to the mitigation of hypertension. 3-Hydroxypentanoic acids obstruct agonist-induced constriction of arterial smooth muscle in a dose-responsive manner, resembling the findings reported in Corbin et al., J. Med. Chem., 1982, 25:90-93. The synthesis of 3-aryl-1-hydroxypentanoic acids is complex due to the plasticity of the C-3 asymmetric carbon, analogous to the instability of the chiral center in isovaleric acid; Leclerc et al., J. Org. Chem., 1983, 48:3548-3551. Historical synthetic strategies, like those elucidated in Schmidt et al., Ber., 1937, 70:465-468, that employ xylose and intermolecular cross-aldol reactions in the production of tocopherols, lead to racemic 3-aryl-1-hydroxypentanoic acids. In the current invention, a novel strategy is implemented for the formation of chiral 3-aryl-1-hydroxypentanoic acids using a stereospecific aldol reaction between chiral \u03b1-phenoxybenzylaldehydes and the negatively charged derivative of propyl 1,3-propanedithiol-2-carboxylate, followed by conversion of the intermediate alkoxide to a protected ester. The invention is further extended to the use of these chiral compounds in pharmaceutical formulations intended for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, the easing of arterial constriction, and the possible prevention of related disorders. The detailed invention procedure includes the employment of propyl 1,3-propanedithiol-2-carboxylate anion and the reaction with chiral \u03b1-phenoxybenzylaldehydes to procure a series of intermediates eventually leading to the desired 3-aryl-1-hydroxypentanoic acids. Overall, the invention contributes an efficacious pathway for synthesizing compounds with beneficial cardiovascular effects and potential applications in the therapeutic domain.\n\n",

The Government has certain rights in this invention. This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/201,775, filed Feb. 25, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,721; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 07/847,295, filed Mar. 6, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,298,526; which is a division of U.S. Ser. No. 07/464,511, filed Jan. 12, 1990, and now U.S. Pat. No. 5,095,126. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to methods for the synthesis of optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acid aci-reductone compounds. The aci-reductone 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxytetronic acid compound (CHTA) possesses antilipidemic and antiaggregatory properties which differ from those of the classical phenoxyactetic acids as has been disclosed in Witiak et al. J. Med. Chem., 1988, 31:1434-1445 and Kamanna et al., Lipids, 1989, 24:25-32. Although unsubstituted-, 2-alkyl- and 2-acyltetronic acids are frequently found in nature, the 2-hydroxy substituted redox system is found only in vitamin C and its closely related relatives (isoascrobic acid, erythroascorbic acid) and derivatives, and the macrolide antibiotic chlorothricin. The antiaggregatory activities of 2-hydroxytetronic acid aci-reductone compound (CHTA) is of interest since blood platelets are involved in the genesis of atherosclerosis. 2-Hydroxytetronic acid aci-reductones inhibit collagen-induced human platelet aggregation and secretion of 14 C!-serotonin in a concentration-dependent manner at equivalent doses, as reported in Witiak et al., J. Med. Chem., 1982, 25:90-93. The CHTA compound inhibits platelet function by a similar mechanism, involving arachidonic acid release. Redox analogues, such as 2-hydroxytetronic acid, function as antioxidants in membranes or interfere with free radical processes involved in the biosynthetic elaboration of cyclic prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGG 2 and PGH 2 ), and, subsequently, thromboxane A 2 from arachidonic acid. The synthesis of 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acid compounds of the present invention is complicated by the stereochemical lability of the C-4 stereogenic center. The lability of this center in tetronic acids can be compared to the lability of the asymmetric center of mandelic acid; Whitesell et al., J. Org. Chem., 1983, 48:3548-3551 and Gore et al., J. Org. Chem., 1986, 51:3700-3704, and phenylglycine, Evans et al., Tetrahedron, 1988, 44:5525-5540, Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Syn., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, N.Y., 1984, p. 160, which discloses that phenylglycine undergoes extensive racemization during peptide synthesis. Older synthetic methods such as disclosed in Helferich et al., Ber., 1937, 70:465-468, involving benzoin and intermolecular Claisen condensations employed in the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid, produce racemic 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acids. Various syntheses published for the naturally occurring chiral tetronic acids such as (-)-vertinolide (Wrobel et al., J. Org. Chem., 1983, 48:3761-3764); (S)-carlosic acid (Bloomer et al., J. Org. Chem., 1974, 39:113-125); chlorothricin (Ireland et al., J. Org. Chem., 1986, 51:635-648); related 2-acylated (Booth et al., J.Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans I, 1987, 121-129; or 2-unsubstituted (Brandange et al., J. Org. Chem., 1984, 49, 927-928) tetronic acids, and chiral tetronic acid intermediates useful for the synthesis of the seco acid of erthronolide B (Stork et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 987, 109:1564-1565), were not applicable for the synthesis of optically pure enantiometers of 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acids. Some targets contain quaternary chiral centers not expected to undergo racemization during their preparation as disclosed in Wrobel et al., supra, and Ireland et al., supra. Syntheses for 2-hydroxytetronic acids other than ascorbic acid have been reviewed by Haynes and Plimmer in &#34;Tetronic Acids,&#34; Quart, Rev., pp. 292-315 (1960), and by Shank, &#34;Reductones,&#34; Synthesis pp 176-90 (1972) , 2-Hydroxytetronic acids have generally been prepared using three different routes: (1) hydroxyl group insertion at the 2 position of the corresponding tetronic acid nucleus; (2) intramolecular Claisen cyclization of substituted glyoxylate esters; and (3) base-promoted cyclization of 2,4-dihydroxy-3-ketobutanoates. Witiak and Tehim, J. Org. Chem., 52.:2324-2327 (1987) have synthesized the 5- and 6-membered spiro 2-hydroxytetronic acids using propargyl alcohol conversion to methyl tetronate by treatment with sodium methoxide. Attempted hydroxylation at the 2-position by \u03b1-lithiation and reaction with dibenzoylperoxide provided only a 6% yield of the corresponding 2-benzoyloxytetronic acid. However, the 2-hydroxyl group was introduced in good yields by lithiation using lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), boronate ester formation B(MeO) 3 ! and oxidative hydrolysis (AcOH, H 2 O 2 ). Methyl 2-hydroxytetronate was converted to the corresponding aci-reductone by stirring in 48% HBr at 45\u00b0 C. for 12 hours. Ireland and Thompson, J. Org. Chem., 44:3041-3052 (1979), have utilized the Claisen condensation for construction of 2-hydroxytetronic acids. Witiak and Tehim, J. Org. Chem., 52:2324-2327 (1987) have also prepared 5- and 6-membered spiro-2-hydroxytetronic acids using strategies developed by Ireland and Thompson, supra. This method was superior to use of hydroxyl group insertion methods because fewer steps were necessary and overall yields were higher. For example, Claisen cyclization of easily prepared methoxy or benzyloxy thiocarboxylate intermediates using LDA or lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDA) at -78\u00b0 C. occurred in high yields. The resultant 2-methoxytetronic acids underwent deprotection by acetylation and subsequent reaction with BBr 3 , whereas the 2-benzyloxytetronic acids were convertible to target 2-hydroxytetronic acid by transfer hydrogenation. Witiak and Tehim, J. Org. Chem., 55:1112-1114 (1990), developed the first synthesis for optically pure (S)-(+)-4-phenyl-2-hydroxytetronic acid using the Claisen cyclization under kinetically controlled conditions. The 2-benzyloxyacetate derivative of the corresponding methyl mandelate underwent such cyclization at -100\u00b0 C. using the sterically hindered non-nucleophilic base, lithium dicyclohexylamide (LiDCyA). Subsequent benzyl group deprotection of the tetronic acid generated the desired compound in low overall yields; 12% for both steps. Parent application Ser. Nos. 07/464,511 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,095,126) and 07/847,295 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,298,526) relate to the preparation of optically pure stereogenically labile 4-substituted-2-hydroxytetronic acid compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for the synthesis of optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acids containing electron withdrawing substituents. The chiral approach of the presentinvention utilizes an aldol condensation between optically pure \u03b1-t-butyldimethylsilyloxyarylacetaldehydes and the anion of ethyl 1,3-dithiane-2-carboxylate, followed by trapping the intermediate alkoxide anion with pivaloyl chloride to yield a fully protected butanoate ester containing the masked enediol functionality of the target aci-reductones. The dithiane moiety is then oxidatively hydrolyzed to produce an \u03b1-keto ester which undergoes fluoride anion catalyzed-cyclization to 2-pivaloyloxytetronic acid derivatives which are then hydrolyzed under acidic conditions or by hydride reduction to the corresponding 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acids. The invention is further related to the methods of using such optically pure compounds as potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation, cyclooxygenase, and 5-lipooxygenase, and pharmaceutical compositions therefor. The invention is further concerned with the pharmaceutical use of such compositions for the treatment and/or the prevention of coronary artery diseases, platelet aggregation and thrombosis, and/or prevention of atherosclerosis, as well as in the treatment of various pathologies involving both acute and chronic inflammation, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In a first embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for making optically pure 4-aryl-2hydroxytetronic acid compounds of Formula I: ##STR1## wherein Z is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group. This process comprises: (a) reacting an optically pure aldehyde of the formula II ##STR2## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Pr is a protecting group selected from the group consisting of t-butyldimethylsilyl, tetrahydropyranyl, thiomethyl, methoxymethyl, and Z is as hereinbefore defined, with the anion of an alkyl 1,3-dithiane-2-carboxylate followed by trapping of the intermediate alkoxide anion with a pivaloyl halide to yield a protected ester of the formula ##STR3## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z and Pr are as hereinbefore defined and alk is a lower alkyl group; (b) oxidatively hydrolyzing the protected ester of formula III to yield the \u03b1-keto ester of formula IV ##STR4## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z, Pr and alk are as hereinbefore defined; (c) catalytically cyclizing the ester of formula IV to yield the 2-pivaloyloxytetronic acid derivative of formula V: ##STR5## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z is as hereinbefore defined; and (d) removal by hydrolysis or reductive cleavage of the pivaloyl ester group to afford the desired optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acid of formula Ia or Ib. Step (a) of the instant process utilizes as starting material, the appropriate optically pure hydroxy aldehyde of the formula ##STR6## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z and Pr are as hereinbefore defined which, in a 1:1.1 mixture with pivaloyl chloride, is reacted with the lithium salt of an alkyl 1,3-dithiane-2-carboxylate at about -78\u00b0 C. in a nonpolar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran according to the method of Belletire et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 25(50):5729-5732 (1984). Preferably, the alkyl 1,3-dithiane-2-carboxylate is ethyl or methyl 1,3-dithiane-2-carboxlate, but other alkyl esters may similarly be utilized. The Pr protecting group is most preferably a t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group, but other hydroxy protecting groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, methoxymethyl and thiomethoxy can be similarly utilized. Thus afforded is the compound of formula III ##STR7## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z, Pr and alk are as hereinbefore defined, which is then oxidatively hydrolyzed using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) and silver nitrate according to the method of Corey and Erickson, J. Org. Chem., 36:3553 (1971). Typically, this hydrolysis is conducted at room temperature in an aqueous organic solvent, such as aqueous acetonitrile. The resultant compound of formula IV, i.e., ##STR8## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z, Pr and alk are as hereinbefore defined, is then catalytically cyclized to yield the 2-pivaloyloxytetronic acid derivative of formula V: ##STR9## or its corresponding isomer, wherein Z is as hereinbefore defined. The cyclization of step (c) is induced with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and is usually conducted with a non-polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or a similar ether. Typical reaction times vary from 5-20 minutes and the reaction is usually conducted at room temperature. Interestingly, the pivaloyl group undergoes O\u2192O-acyl migration during the cyclization step (c). Step (d) of the instant reaction sequence hydrolyzes the compound of formula V to afford the desired optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acid of formulae Ia or Ib. Typically, the hydrolysis of step (d) is accomplished with a mild aqueous acid, such as acetic acid, at reflux temperatures for 12-36 hours. A preferred hydrolysis utilizes 9.8:0.2 acetic acid:water for 24 hours at reflux temperatures. These conditions yield the target compound of formula I with minimal racemization. Alternately, the pivoloate cleavage can be accomplished under neutral conditions by selective hydride reduction. In this alternate embodiment, the compound of formula V is dissolved in an organic solvent and preferably cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere. This solution is then treated with, for instance, DIBAL-H to effect reductive cleavage of the pivaloyl ester. A second embodiment of the present invention relates to optically pure 4-aryl-2-hydroxytetronic acid compounds of the general formuiae Ia or Ib ##STR10## wherein Z is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group. In a composition aspect, the present invention encompasses novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising the optically pure compound of the general formulae Ia and Ib, together with a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient, in an amount sufficient to have antilipidemic, antiaggregatory or antiinflammatory activities in an animal or patient. The compounds and their compositions of the present invention are thus useful in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerotic disorders, as well as in the treatment of various pathologies in which acute and chronic inflammation occur. As used herein, the term &#34;substituted or unsubstituted aryl&#34; means an organic, aromatic group which can be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more halogen, lower alkyl, alkoxy, aromatic or heteroaromatic groups. Examples of unsubstituted aryl groups include phenyl, pyridyl, thiophenyl, furyl, pyrrolyl and the like. Examples of substituted aryl groups include those such as halogen substituted phenyl, e.g., 4-chlorophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 2,4-dichlorophenyl; alkyl-substituted aryl, e.g., tolyl, 3-methylpyridyl, 2,3-dimethylphenyl, 4-ethylphenyl, 4-isobutylphenyl; alkoxysubstituted aryl, e.g., 4-methoxyphenyl; and aryl-substituted aryl, e.g., 1,1&#39;-biphenyl. As used herein, the term &#34;alkyl&#34; means straight- or branched-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups preferably containing 1-6 carbon atoms. Representative of such groups are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like. The term &#34;alkoxy&#34; means a lower alkyl group attached to the remainder of the molecule by oxygen. Examples of alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy and the like. The starting materials of formula II are known in the art and/or are preparable by methods described herein. Optically pure enantiomers of mandelic acid are commercially available. Numerous methods exist for the manufacture of optically active and optically pure derivatives of mandelic acid such as the p-chloro- and p-phenylmandelic acids. A wide range of chiral bases are used to resolve mandelic acid precursors including methylbenzylamine, brucine and ephedrine. Partial separation of enantiomers is accomplished with optically active solvents such as (-)-menthone, (-)-menthyl acetate and (+)-limonene. Anion-exchange chromatography using a amino-1,3-propanediol, or chromatography through starch successfully separates mandelic acid enantiomers. Reduction of 1-menthyl benzoylformate with Na-amalgam followed by saponification of the menthyl ester provides 1-mandelic acid. Asymmetric syntheses of mandelic acid precursors include the Alpine borane reduction of methyl benzoylformate, hydroxy insertion using Evan&#39;s chiral imide enolate, and L-selectride reduction of (+)- or (-)-menthol benzoylformate. Procedures developed for the production of racemic mandelic acid derivatives are well documented in the literature. Ando&#39;s scheme (Ando, J. Chem. Soc. Japan, 56:745-756 (1935)) relies upon the condensation of benzene derivatives with ethyl ketomalonate in the presence of SnCl 4. This affords hydroxy diesters which after saponification and decarboxylation liberate racemic mandelic acid derivatives. The approach formulated by Compere (Compere, J. Org. Chem., 33:2565-2566 (1968)) generates mandelic acid derivatives in one step and in high yield by condensing substituted benzaldehydes with bromoform in the presence of potassium hydroxide and lithium chloride. Furthermore, mandelic acid is obtained in 45% yield by subjecting \u03b1-chloroacetophenone to aqueous alkali under normal atmospheric conditions (see Eaborn, J. Chem. Soc., pp. 1935-1936 (1957)). A generally useful method involves the production of the optically pure (R) isomers of mandelic acid by resolution using R(+)-methylbenzyl amine and recrystallization of the salt from absolute ethanol. Typically, the compound of the formula VI ##STR11## wherein Z is as hereinbefore defined, is obtained by washing an ether solution of the salt of the formula VII ##STR12## wherein Z is as hereinbefore defined, with 5% aqueous HCl. The ether layer is separated, cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and titrated with CH 2 N.sub. 2 to obtain the optically pure methyl ester of formula VI. This ester of formula VI is then converted to the necessary starting material of formula II by treatment with t-butyldimethylsilylchloride (TBDMSCl) and imidazole in dimethylformamide, followed by DIBAL-H reduction at -78\u00b0 C. The invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising the optically pure compounds of the general formula I above, as well as their physiologically acceptable salts (such as, for example, Na + , K + , NH 4 + ). The compounds of the invention have antilipidemic and antiaggregatory activity and are thus useful in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerotic disorders. Additionally, the compounds of the invention possess the ability to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipooxygenase in standardized assays for such activity, thus making them useful for the treatment of pathologies involving both acute and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and various forms of arthritis. The invention accordingly further provides optically pure compounds of the general formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts for use in the therapy or prophylaxis of atherosclerotic disorders, as well.as in pathologies involving acute and chronic inflammation. When tested according to the methods described in the art, the (S)-isomers of formula I having the formula ##STR13## have been found to possess markedly superior properties when compared to their corresponding (R)-isomers. The R- and S-enantiomers were tested as inhibitors of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma. Data for individual experiments (2 separate donors) are given as pIC 50 (log molar inhibitory concentration of each drug which blocks aggregation to arachidonic acid by 50%) Inhibitors were preincubated for 1 minute prior to addition of arachidonic acid (200-400 \u03bcM).

  "negative": "The apparatus concerns mechanisms for securing, holding, or stabilizing a substance delivery mechanism, and the methods associated with fabricating and utilizing such mechanisms. Specifically, it pertains to a protective cap apparatus intended for temporary connection with a substance dispensation system. The said dispensation system might be employed for health treatments, including the application of therapeutic agents such as hormones, and may be designed for patient-led administration. It can be structured for multipurpose usage and enables adjustment or pre-selection of the desired dosage amount. Typically, this device can be involved in managing conditions such as hormonal imbalances among others. To combat the hazard of contamination, protective cap mechanisms are devised to make the dispensation system operable for a single usage. For instance, a protective cap mechanism described in document WO 01/91837 A1 showcases a similar setup. The apparatus includes a holstered needle that is immovably secured, with one segment extending outward from the holster along the advancing axis and another extending backward. The aim of the innovation discussed herein is to enhance the safety and mitigate risks associated with puncture wounds when utilizing such instruments. The invention includes a protective cap that can be removable yet affixed to a dispensation mechanism. In its various versions, the apparatus might have a needle that is secured by the holder and extends both forwardly and backwardly, potentially featuring separable needle segments linked for fluid transition, or alternatively, a single-piece design that both extends into the tissue for substance administration and also pierces any sealing membrane at the substance reservoir outlet. A protective measure is implemented, enabling movement along its axis from an initial disengagement to a safeguarded stance, occasionally by elastic force. When the mechanism is disengaged, the needle's administering end is exposed beyond the protective cap. Conversely, in the safeguarded position, the protective cap covers the administering needle tip. Initially, the cap might be in a forward setup from which it can transition to a disengaged state. Some designs include an irreversible lock for the protective cap in its safeguarded state, only engaging upon reaching the final guard position in its axial movement. This document also includes discussion of protective cap apparatus that aren't necessarily self-locking post-use but function mainly to obscure the needle, reducing apprehension for the administering individual. Among numerous possible configurations, the apparatus can include a second protective cap, moving in a backward direction, and a locking system that secures the second cap upon reaching its final position. Although prior literature illustrates distal guards, the embodiment here focuses on the additional back-end safety standards after use. When attached to a delivery device, the apparatus can include an attachment mechanism such as a sleeve, interacting with corresponding elements on the delivery tool to ensure a detachable connection. The attachment might take the form of snap-on or other variants and typically surrounds the needle section commonly exposed in such mechanisms. Keeping safety in mind, the apparatus attempts to closely encompass the needle to minimize the likelihood of accidental pricking. In this design, an automatic locking setup for the backwardly positioned protective cap is emphasized. Additionally, the document covers potential variations involving spring elements and mechanisms that facilitate the cap\u2019s movement towards its final safeguarded state. While locking systems with at least two elements are highlighted, there's also discussion of simple guiding mechanisms that lead to secured positions without requiring the flexibility in locking elements. Detailed illustrations accompany the explanation of the invention, with figures depicting various views and cross-sections of the apparatus along with its components aligned. The detailed descriptions and images aim to convey a comprehensive understanding of the overall structure and functionality of the innovative protective cap mechanism.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCED RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/399,700, filed Mar. 6, 2009,issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,052,653 on Nov. 8, 2011, which is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/CH2007/000414 filed Aug. 22, 2007, which claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2006 042 233.3 filed Sep. 6, 2006, the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND The invention relates to devices for injecting, delivering, infusing, dispensing or administering a substance, and to methods of making and using such devices. More particularly, it relates to a needle guard device which is releasably attached to or can be attached to an injection device. The injection device may be used to administer medicaments, for example insulin, and for self-administration, i.e. by patients who administer the relevant medicament themselves. The injection device may be configured for repeated use and to allow the dose of product to be administered to be set or selected. More particularly, the injection device may be an injection device of the type used to treat diabetes or otherwise. To prevent the risk of infections, needle guard devices have been developed which enable an injection device to be used only once. A needle guard device of this type is known from patent specification WO 01/91837 A1, for example. The injection needle extends through the needle holder and is fixedly secured by the needle holder. It has an injection portion extending beyond the needle holder in the distal direction and a connecting portion extending beyond the needle holder in the proximal direction. SUMMARY One object of the present invention is to provide needle guard devices that increase the level of safety which can be achieved by using such devices and to prevent injury due to piercing. In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a needle guard which can be releasably attached to an injection device. In one embodiment, the needle guard comprises an injection needle and a needle holder holding the injection needle, from which the needle projects by a needle injection portion in the distal (front or forward) direction and from which the needle projects by a needle connecting portion in the proximal (rear) direction. The needle guard also has a distal needle guard for the needle injection portion which is connected to the needle holder so that it can move. The injection needle may extend through the needle holder and is fixedly secured by the needle holder. Alternatively, the needle injection portion and the needle connecting portion may also be separate needles, which are retained by the needle holder and connected to one another to establish a fluid flow. However, the needle holder may also incorporate the two needle portions in a single piece. When administering the substance or product to be administered, the needle injection portion pierces the skin and/or tissue lying subcutaneously underneath. When a membrane is attached, providing a tight seal at a distal outlet of a reservoir filled with the product to be administered, the needle connecting portion pierces it. The distal needle guard is able to move in the distal direction relative to the needle holder from a released position as far as a guard position, such as by spring force. When the needle guard assumes the released position, the injection needle sits or rests with its needle injection portion beyond the needle guard in the distal direction. In the guard position, on the other hand, the needle guard overlaps the needle injection portion as far as and including a distal (forward or injection end) end of the injection needle. In the initial state prior to using the device for the first time, the needle guard may assume a distal initial position from which it can be moved into the released position. In some embodiments, the distal needle guard is locked in the guard position so that it can not be moved into the released position again. The lock may be established automatically when the needle guard has reached the guard position, having moved in the distal direction. Apart from self-locking needle guard devices of this type, however, the present invention also generally relates to needle guard devices with a displaceable distal needle guard which does not lock after an injection. In such designs, the needle guard is primarily used to block the view to remove the fear of the injection needle for a user administering the product himself. As provided herein, in some embodiments, the needle guard device comprises a proximal needle guard, which is displaceably connected to the needle holder. The proximal needle guard can be moved in the proximal direction out of a released position as far as a guard position. In the released position, the needle connecting portion extends beyond the proximal needle guard in the proximal direction. In the guard position, the proximal needle guard overlaps the needle connecting portion up to and including the proximal end of the injection needle. The needle guard device also has a lock mechanism for the proximal needle guard. As soon as the proximal needle guard has reached the guard position, having moved in the proximal direction, it is automatically locked by the lock mechanism so that it is no longer able to move back into the released position. Although needle guard devices with a distal guard are already known from the prior art, for example, from patent specification WO 01/91837 A1 mentioned above, as recognized herein, the needle connecting portion can also cause piercing injuries after the respective needle guard device has been used and the embodiments disclosed herein eliminate this risk via the other needle guard which automatically locks in a guard position after the needle guard device in accordance with the present invention has been used, i.e. as the injection device is removed or after it has been removed. In some embodiments, the needle guard device has a fixing mechanism configured as a fixing sleeve to provide a releasable connection to the injection device. The fixing mechanism may co-operate with fixing means associated with or disposed externally on the injection pen. It may be a threaded or bayonet sleeve or a snap-fit, catch-fit or clip-on sleeve, for example. In such designs, the fixing device surrounds the needle connecting portion in a manner conventionally used for needle guard devices. However, the known fixing devices are usually so large in terms of their diameter that the user can easily reach the needle tip of the needle connecting portion with the finger and injure himself. The distal needle guard provided herein, however, is disposed closer to the needle connecting portion than with other fixing mechanisms, and the distance measured transversely to the needle connecting portion is short, such that the user does not come into contact with the proximal needle tip if he touches the proximal end of the proximal needle guard. As a result, the manufacturer also has greater freedom in terms of the design of the fixing mechanism because it offers an additional protective function compared with the other sleeve-shaped, fixing mechanisms, but in this case protecting against piercing injuries can be obtained by the proximal needle guard. In some embodiments, a needle guard device in accordance with the present invention has a spring element, which biases the proximal needle guard in the proximal direction by a spring force. The spring element may be supported directly on the proximal needle guard but may also act on the needle guard via one or more intermediate elements. In such designs, when the needle guard device is removed from the injection device, the needle guard is moved into the guard position by spring force. In other variants, the same spring element also acts in the distal direction on the distal needle guard directly or via one or more intermediate elements. In further embodiments, the spring element is supported at one end on the distal needle guard and at the oppositely lying end on the proximal needle guard. Depending on its function, the spring element may be a compression spring, such as a helical spring. In alternative embodiments, the proximal needle guard is not moved into the guard position by spring force, but by a retaining mechanism comprising a retaining holder on the proximal needle guard and a retaining holder on the injection device or product reservoir, which automatically move into a retaining engagement when the needle guard device and injection device are connected, which causes the proximal needle guard to be moved from the released position into the guard position when the needle guard device is released. Once the proximal needle guard has assumed its guard position, the retaining engagement automatically releases when the needle guard device is substantially or completely detached from the injection device. In some embodiments, the lock mechanism comprises at least two locking elements, a first locking element formed on the needle holder or, in the situation where the parts are separate, connected to the needle holder, and a second locking element formed on the proximal needle guard or, in the situation where the parts are separate, connected to the needle guard. At least one of the locking elements may be able to move transversely to the longitudinal direction of the injection needle against a resistant or rebounding spring force. The relevant locking element itself may be inflexible, i.e. rigid, and in such embodiments is biased by the rebounding spring force by a separate spring element. However, the relevant locking element may be elastic and may form an elastic bending beam. The rebounding spring force may be used to move the locking element into the locked engagement with the other locking element. The locked engagement may be achieved by an elastic snapping movement. In alternative embodiments, however, the lock mechanism may be provided in the form of only rigid locking elements, i.e. they are not flexible. This being the case, however, the locking elements may need to be moved into the locked engagement when the proximal needle guard moves into the guard position. In such embodiments, the lock mechanism may have one or more slide guides, by which the locking elements are forcibly guided relative to one another into the locked engagement. In some embodiments, the second locking element formed on the proximal needle guard or connected to the needle guard may be guided outwardly from the needle guard and co-operate with the first locking element by gripping the needle guard device, but the proximal needle guard may extend through the needle holder in the distal or in the proximal direction, at least in the guard position. In one embodiment, the proximal needle guard assumes a proximal (rearward) initial position prior to using the needle guard device, from which it is moved into the released position as the needle guard device is connected to the injection device. In a second embodiment, the proximal needle guard is already in the released position in the state in which the needle guard device is sold. In both embodiments, the needle guard device comprises an unlocking element. In the first embodiment, the unlocking element co-operates with the at least one locking element, which can be displaced transversely to the longitudinal direction of the injection device so that the locked engagement can be established during the movement out of the proximal initial position into the released position because the unlocking element is engaged with the transversely moving locking element, which may also include the situation in which it is engaged with the first and the second locking element in order to prevent the locked engagement. During the course of the injection, such as during piercing by the needle injection portion or as the needle injection portion is being pulled out of or has been pulled out of the tissue, the engagement between the unlocking element and locking element is automatically released so that the locking elements are able to move into the locked engagement when the needle guard device is detached from the injection device. In the second embodiment, during piercing by the injection needle, the unlocking element is moved out of an unlocking position, in which it prevents the proximal needle guard from moving in the proximal direction, into a neutral position in which it permits such a movement and hence a movement into the guard position. The unlocking element of the second embodiment may be rotatable and connectable to the needle holder so as to be rotatable about the injection needle. The unlocking elements of both embodiments may be coupled with the distal needle guard or may be automatically coupled with the distal needle guard during piercing or as the injection needle is being pulled out of the tissue. In such designs, the distal needle guard causes the unlocking element to move out of the unlocking position into the neutral position via the coupling. The coupling may be a driving engagement by which the distal needle guard drives the unlocking element with it as far as the neutral position as it moves in the distal direction, i.e. during removal from the tissue. Alternatively, the slide guide may form the coupling, in which case the slide guide converts the piercing movement or the movement of extracting the distal needle guard into the movement of the unlocking element out of the unlocking position into the neutral position. As a result, the slide guide enables a linear piercing movement or extraction movement of the distal needle guard to be converted into a rotating movement of the unlocking element, for example.

  "negative": "The present invention pertains to systems and procedures for the treatment of tissue by employing a radiofrequency current to induce thermal effects and potential ablation of the tissue. The treatment involves applying the current from a radiofrequency source through two distinct media. The initial medium includes an inert gas that does not conduct electricity and can be ionized to create a form of gas plasma through the introduction of high radiofrequency voltage or thermal energy. This plasma then interacts with the subsequent medium, which is a thin layer of insulating material placed between the plasma and the target tissue, facilitating capacitive coupling to the tissue. Methods for utilizing such systems involve enclosing the non-conductive gas within an applicator encased by a thin insulating wall. The outer surface of this insulator is placed in contact with the tissue, followed by the application of a voltage capable of ionizing the gas, thereby inducing plasma and enabling capacitive coupling into the tissue. The non-conductive gas may actively flow or remain static within the chamber, with flow rates and chamber volumes varying based on the procedure. Configurations of the insulating wall may range from rigid to flexible to accommodate different tissue surfaces, with potential support structures to assist in shaping or deploying the wall during treatment. Electrodes are placed to span the gas and the insulating wall, through which the radiofrequency voltage is transmitted, thereby initiating ionization and capacitive coupling to facilitate the treatment of tissue.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of provisional application No. 61/196,870 (Attorney Docket No. 027980-000100US), filed on Oct. 21, 2008, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application is being filed on the same day as application no. 12/______ (Attorney Docket No. 027980-000110US) which has a substantially identical disclosure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present invention relates to electrosurgical devices and related methods for rapid, controlled ablation of tissue. More particularly, the present invention relates to treating tissue with a radiofrequency current delivered through an electrically non-conductive gas which is ionized to capacitively couple to surrounding tissue through a thin dielectric layer surrounding the gas. [0004] The treatment of diseased organs, such as the uterus and the gallbladder, by ablation of an endometrial or mucosal layer surrounding the interior of the organ has long been proposed. Such internal surface ablation can be achieved by heating the surface, treating the surface with microwave energy, treating the surface with cryoablation, and delivering radiofrequency energy to the surface. Of particular interest to the present invention, a variety of radiofrequency ablation structures have been proposed including solid electrodes, balloon electrodes, metalized fabric electrodes, and the like. While often effective, at least most of the prior electrode designs have suffered from one or more deficiencies, such as relatively slow treatment times, incomplete treatments, non-uniform ablation depths, and risk of injury to adjacent organs. [0005] For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide methods and apparatus for the radiofrequency ablation of internal tissue surfaces which are rapid, provide for uniform ablation depths, which assure complete ablation over the entire targeted surface, and which reduce the risk of injury to adjacent organs. At least some of these objectives will be met by the inventions described hereinbelow. [0006] 2. Description of the Background Art [0007] U.S. Pat.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] The present invention provides methods, apparatus, and systems for treating tissue of a patient. The treatment generally comprises delivering a radiofrequency current to the tissue in order to heat and usually ablate the tissue to a desired depth. Current is delivered to the tissue from a radiofrequency energy source through a first dielectric medium and a second dielectric medium in series with the first medium. The first dielectric medium will usually comprise an electrically non-conductive gas which may be ionized to form a plasma, typically by application of a high voltage radiofrequency voltage, but optionally by the direct application of heat to the gas, further optionally by the application of both the high radiofrequency voltage and heat to the gas. The second dielectric medium will separate the first medium from the target tissue, typically comprising a thin dielectric material, such as silicone or a silicone-based material, more typically comprising a thin dielectric wall which defines an interior chamber which contains the electrically non-conductive gas. The radiofrequency current is thus delivered to the tissue by applying a radiofrequency voltage across the first and second dielectric media so that the first dielectric becomes ionized, typically forming a gas plasma, and the second dielectric allows current flow to the tissue via capacitive coupling. [0009] Methods for treating tissue of a patient in accordance with the present invention comprise containing an electrically non-conductive gas in an interior chamber of an applicator having a thin dielectric wall surrounding at least a portion of the interior chamber. An external surface of the thin dielectric wall is engaged against a target region of the tissue, and a radiofrequency voltage is applied across the gas and thin wall, where the voltage is sufficient to ionize the gas to initiate a plasma in the gas and to capacitively couple the current in the gas plasma across the dielectric wall and into the engaged tissue. [0010] The electrically non-conductive gas may be held statically within the chamber, but will more often be actively flowing through the chamber of the applicator. The flow rate of the non-conductive gas will typically be in the range from about 1 ml/sec to 50 ml/sec, preferably from 5 ml/sec to 30 ml/sec. The interior chamber will have a volume in the range from 0.01 ml to 100 ml, typically from 2 ml to 10 ml. Usually, the electrically non-conductive gas will be argon or another noble gas or mixture of noble gases. [0011] The dielectric wall of the applicator may assume a variety of configurations. In a first embodiment, the dielectric wall will have a generally fixed shape that will remain constant regardless of the internal pressurization of the contained gas. Alternatively, the dielectric wall may be elastic, conformable, slack, or otherwise having a changeable shape which can conform to the engaged tissue surface. In some examples, the thin dielectric wall will comprise a balloon or other inflatable structure which is expanded by increasing an internal pressure of the electrically non-conductive gas or other medium. Alternatively, a separate frame, cage, spring, or other mechanical deployment structure could be provided within an elastic or non-elastic conformable thin dielectric wall. In the latter case, the frame or other structure can be configured and reconfigured to shape the thin dielectric wall as desired in the method. [0012] The voltage is applied to the tissue by providing a first electrode surface coupled to the non-conductive gas and a second electrode surface coupled to the patient tissue. A radiofrequency voltage is then applied across the first and second electrodes in order to both ionize the electrically non-conductive gas (forming a plasma) within the interior chamber and to capacitively couple the charged plasma with tissue across the thin dielectric wall. [0013] The voltage applied to the first and second dielectric media will depend on the distance between the first electrode surface and the dielectric wall as well as the resistance between the dielectric wall and the second electrode which is in contact with the tissue, typically being in the range between 500V (rms) and 2500V (rms). In the exemplary embodiments, the first electrode surface will usually be in or on the interior chamber or a gas flow path leading to the interior chamber, and the second electrode surface will be in contact with the patient&#39;s tissue, often being disposed on a shaft or other external surface of the treatment device. [0014] In a second aspect of the present invention, apparatus for delivering radiofrequency current to tissue comprises a body having a support end, a working end, and an interior chamber. A thin dielectric wall surrounds at least a portion of the interior chamber and has an external surface disposed at the working end of the body. A gas inlet will be provided to connect to the chamber for delivery of an electrically non-conductive gas, either in a continuously flowing mode or in a static mode. A first electrode structure is provided which has a surface exposed to either the interior chamber or the gas inlet. A second electrode structure is also provided and has a surface adapted to contact tissue, typically being somewhere on the body, more typically being on a handle or shaft portion of the device. The apparatus further includes a radiofrequency power supply connected to apply a radiofrequency voltage across the first and second electrode structures, wherein the voltage is sufficient to initiate ionization of the gas into a plasma within the chamber. The voltage will further be sufficient to capacitively couple the current in the plasma across the dielectric wall and into tissue adjacent the external surface. [0015] The specific structure of the body may vary. In a first example, the dielectric wall may comprise a rigid material, typically selected from the group consisting of a ceramic, glass, and polymer. The rigid material may be formed into a variety of geometries, including a tube, sphere, or the like. Usually, the dielectric wall will have a thickness in the range from about 0.002 in to 0.1 in, usually from 0.005 in to 0.05 in. [0016] In alternative embodiments, the dielectric wall may comprise a conformable material, typically a silicone. Such conformable dielectric walls will typically have a thickness in the range from about 0.004 in to 0.03 in, usually from 0.008 in to 0.015 in. The conformable wall may be non-distensible or may be elastic so that the wall structure may be inflated. For either non-distensible or elastic dielectric walls, the device may further comprise a frame which supports the conformable material, usually where the frame can be expanded and contracted to open and close the dielectric wall. [0017] The apparatus of the present invention will typically also include a shaft or other handle structure connected to the support end of the body. Usually, the shaft will have a lumen which extends into the gas inlet of the body to deliver the electrically non-conductive gas to the chamber. The shaft or handle may also include at least a second lumen for removing the electrically non-conductive gas from the chamber so that the gas may be recirculated in a continuous flow. Often, the first electrode will be at least partly in the first lumen of the device, although it may also be within the chamber or within both the first lumen and the chamber. The second electrode will usually be disposed at least partly over an exterior surface of the device, typically over the shaft, although in certain systems the second electrode could be disposed on a separate dispersal pod. [0018] Apparatus according to the present invention will have an interior chamber volume in the range from 0.01 ml to 20 ml, typically from 1 ml to 10 ml. The dielectric wall will have an area in the range from 1 mm 2 to 100 mm 2 , typically from 5 mm 2 to 50 mm 2. The first electrode surface will have an area in contact with the electrically non-conductive gas in the range from 0.01 mm 2 to 10 mm 2 , typically from 1 mm 2 to 5 mm 2. Additionally, the second electrode structure will have an area available to contact tissue in the range from 0.5 mm 2 to 50 mm 2 , usually from 1 mm 2 to 10 mm 2. [0019] The radiofrequency power supply may be of general construction as often used in electrosurgery. The power supply will typically be configured to deliver a voltage in the range from 500 V (rms) to 2500 V (rms), usually from 600 V (rms) to 1200V (rms), typically at a current in the range from 0.1 A to 1 A, typically from 0.2 A to 0.5 A, and at a frequency in the range from 450 kHz to 550 MHz, usually from 480 kHz to 500 MHz.

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention generally relates to a field of cases or kits for housing and carrying a plurality of individual cosmetic containers. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved compact case, which can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck, wherein removable inserts, each containing a predetermined shade and/or type of cosmetic, can be securely held in place thereby providing the user with a variety of cosmetic materials from which to choose. 2. Description of the Related Art Cosmetic materials available to the consumers in the market place are very numerous. The particular cosmetic assortment which an individual consumer purchases is entirely dependent upon that consumer&#39;s subjective preferences. A typical consumer of cosmetics normally desires an assortment of cosmetics which includes the desired colors, tints and hues to satisfy the consumer&#39;s preferences, in particular to fit and complement that consumer&#39;s facial characteristics, skin and hair color and condition, and even clothes. Additionally, various types of cosmetics may be desirable, for example, shadows, mascara, foundations, lipstick, powder, blush, lip gloss and so on. A typical packaging of cosmetics supplies traditionally comprised pre-selected, fixed containers of cosmetic materials having a variety of both colors and types. However, individual users&#39; tastes and needs vary widely, as noted above. Consequently, the cosmetics materials which do not suit a particular user&#39;s needs or taste would be inevitably wasted. This, of course, is costly to the consumer since the unused and wasted cosmetics are purchased together with desired cosmetics. It is, therefore, highly desirable to ameliorate such squander, to alleviate the prodigal practices and to ensure that consumers will have at their disposal a complete array of only desired cosmetics. To accomplish this advantageous result, there is need to provide a cosmetic compact case wherein a matrix configuration is provided to accept a plurality of individual removable cosmetic inserts so as to establish a cosmetic palette. There is, therefore, a need that the individual cosmetic inserts can be offered to the consumer independent of the compact case into which they will be positioned. Should such device be provided, consumers will be able to choose only those preferred cosmetics which are desirable for purchase and assemble them in a compact case so as to establish a personal and unique arrangement of cosmetics. In order to securely hold the inserts in their predetermined matrix position, it is very beneficial to use the inserts made of magnetic materials. Furthermore, it is desired that the case also include a centrally positioned divider, which can be a mirror. The divider would separate a powder section of the case from the section containing other supplies, such as eye shadows, lip color concealers, etc. Such design is especially desired by professional users of cosmetics, like professional actors and actresses, entertainers, musicians, and the like. Moreover, it is further beneficial to have a cosmetics case which can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck, so as to be immediately available. A belt attached to the case, for example, a VELCRO\u2122 belt or a belt having hook and loop fasteners, can be used for this purpose. U.S. Pat. No. 1,808,961 to Lyhne describes a compact and puff holder for vanity boxes. The Lyhne device has two sections each capable of holding containers with cosmetic supplies. The two sections are separated by a mirror serving also as a divider between the two sections. Yet, the Lyhne device comprises no Velcro fastener, and it cannot be worn around the user&#39;s neck or wrist, but only in a handbag. Furthermore, the Lyhne device does not have magnetically held inserts. Instead, the trays in Lyhne are held in place by mechanical means, which is less efficient and less reliable than the magnetic holders. U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,127 to Geer also describes a cosmetic case having interchangeable cosmetic inserts. This device also comprises a divider. However, the divider in the Geer device does not really separate different kinds of cosmetics. In Geer, they all are on one side and the purpose the lid serves is not to separate the inserts on either side of the lid, but rather to hold them in place and to prevent them from shifting. Geer uses no magnets to accomplish this goal. U.S. Pat. No. 2,264,300 to Davies describes a case having two halves. The first half is designed to hold cleansing disks, wafers and the like which have to be kept moist. The second half is for holding cosmetic supplies. The two halves are separated by a mirror which also serves as a divider. However, in Davies, just as in Geer, all the cosmetic are located on the same side and no magnets to hold the cosmetic inserts in place are used. Davies does not even teaches that those inserts are replaceable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,420 to Sussman describes a make-up kit having replaceable inserts. Each kind of cosmetic is held in a separate module, the contents of each are replaced upon exhaustion. However, this patent does not disclose any kind of a divider in the middle. Furthermore, Sussman does not disclose any magnets for holding the cosmetic modules in place. U.S. Pat. No. 5,005,697 to Jimbo, et. al. describes a make-up case containing a number of cosmetic pans. The bottom of each pan is provided with a magnet and the pans are held in place magnetically. However, there is no divider of any kind described in this patent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,012 to Kamen, et. al. describes a compact case and is somewhat alike the above-mentioned Jimbo patent. Kamen also uses magnets to hold cosmetic containers in place. In addition, the magnets are used to seal a joint between the lid and the base of the compact case. However, like in Jimbo, this patent describes no divider. U.S. Pat. No. 3,006,350 to Grunfeld describes a vanity case. It is designed to be worn around a person&#39;s wrist thus simultaneously being a bracelet as well. However, Gr\u00fcnfeld does not teach using a divider inside the case. Nor is there any use of magnets to hold the cosmetic in place. U.S. Pat. No. 5,655,553 to Giese, et. al. describes a cosmetic compact with cosmetic pans which can be removed, and with a mirror. The pans are held in place mechanically and are removed by applying pressure using mechanical means. This patent does not describe any magnetic devices for retaining the pans in place nor does it have a divider. U.S. Pat. No. 2,601,158 to MacGillivary describes a combination of a wrist watch and a vanity case. The relevancy of this patent lies in the fact that this device can be worn around a woman&#39;s wrist. However, the make-up portion of the MacGillivary device has no magnetized receptacles and no divider in the middle and no provisions are described for replacing the contents of the cosmetic bins. U.S. Pat. No. 1,788,399 to McAtree describes a vanity case having a centrally positioned mirror serving as a separator between two parts of the case. However, McAtree describes no various replaceable receptacles for different kinds of cosmetic nor any magnetic means for keeping the cosmetic in place. U.S. Pat. No. 1,777,027 to D&#39;Arlet describes a vanity case worn on a woman&#39;s wrist. D&#39;Arlet describes a case with compartments for a few kinds of cosmetic accessories. However, this device has no divider and does not provide for replaceable trays holding cosmetic and held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,774,171 to Coons describes another vanity case having a circular shape. This case comprises two similar circular portions, one serving as the cover and another\u2014as the body of the case. Each carries powder compact. There is a mirror, but it is attached directly to one of the portions and is not in the middle of the device separating the portions. There are no compartments for other kinds of cosmetic, no central divider of any kind, no provisions for wearing the device and no magnetic devices for securing the cosmetic. U.S. Pat. No. 1,607,985 to Johnson is similar to the above-described D&#39;Arlet patent, and likewise describes a vanity case worn on a woman&#39;s wrist. Johnson describes a case with only two compartments for cosmetics. The case has a mirror on the lid. However, like in D&#39;Arlet, this device has no divider and does not show replaceable containers holding cosmetic and held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,601,892 to Thralls describes a vanity case having two portions\u2014one for cosmetic supplies and the other\u2014for carrying, for example, business cards or paper money bills. The two portions are separated by a mirror-divider. The presence of this mirror is a feature making the Thralls invention relevant. However, this divider is not used to separate different kinds of cosmetics supplies. Rather, it separates cosmetic supplies from non-cosmetic items such as cards or bills. Moreover, the Thralls invention does not describe features allowing to use replaceable trays for various cosmetic held in place with magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 1,515,812 to Lindon describes a powder puff in a shape of oval. It comprises a lipstick holder. However, Lindon has no centrally located divider and no multiple receptacle for various cosmetic. The Lindon device is designed just for carrying powder and lipstick. U.S. Pat. No. 2,017,722 to Magnus describes a combination of a cigarette case and a vanity case. It shows a device with two compartments, an upper compartment and a lower compartment. The lower compartment serves to hold powder, while the upper compartment contains cigarettes. This device is somewhat relevant because, when the case is open, a mirror separates the two compartments. However, the mirror separates cosmetic (powder) and non-cosmetic (cigarettes) items, similar to the device described in the above-mentioned patent to Thralls. And finally, there are no replaceable cosmetic bins or magnet-based elements to hold them in place. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,130 to Sweder describes a make-up kit mounted on a steering wheel of a vehicle using VELCRO\u2122 or hook and loop fasteners. The Sweder patent only describes a way the kit is mounted on the steering wheel. It does not disclose any features describing how the kit itself is built. Therefore, the review of prior art reveals that no known invention describes a make-up case having the following features: 1) a divider, which divider is preferably, but not necessarily, a mirror; 2) a belt securely attached to the case so that the case can either be worn by the user on her wrist or around her ankle or as a pendant on her neck. In order to allow for wearing the case in such manner, the terminal portions of the belt comprise a velcro material; 3) magnets for holding cosmetic supplies in the case. Yet a need to have a device comprising all these features is acute. The device of the present invention, unlike all prior related art, shows all these features and satisfies all the needs discussed above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a make-up case or kit comprising two sections. The first section includes a plurality of replaceable and interchangeable inserts-holders containing cosmetics supplies, such as eye shadows, lip color concealer, mascara, foundations, lipstick, blush, lip gloss, and the like (except powder). In the first section, a brush holder is also provided to keep a shadow brush, or a lip brush, or a combination brush, one side of which is a shadow brush and the other side\u2014a lip brush. The inserts are made of a magnetic material and are attached to the bottom of the case magnetically. The second section comprises a compartment for holding pressed (compact) powder. This compartment is also removable and can be replaced when the powder is used up. The second section is separated from the first section by a divider. The divider preferably, but not necessarily, comprises a mirror. The bottom of the make-up case of this invention includes two slots in which a belt is secured. The belt is made of an elastic material and comprises VELCRO\u2122, or hook and loop fastener portions, allowing the user to wear the case around his or her wrist or neck. The gist of this invention is that the device described comprises three important features: the magnetic replaceable compartments for cosmetics, a central divider, and a belt so that the case can be worn around the user&#39;s wrist or neck thus maximizing the convenience of the use. No previously known device has all these three features. Therefore, the device of this invention is novel over prior art and is non-obvious in view of it. According to a first aspect of the invention, a case for carrying and storing cosmetics supplies is provided, the case comprising two hingedly connected compartments, a flat dividing element inserted between the compartments which is hingedly held in place, and a plurality of magnetic holders of said cosmetics supplies removably insertable inside the first compartment, wherein the case is opened and closed by rotating either of the compartments about the hinge and the dividing element is rotatable about the hinge to cover either of the compartments. According to another aspect of this invention, the case further includes a belt secured to a bottom of either of the compartments, the belt allowing one to wear the case around a user&#39;s wrist or neck, and in order to facilitate wcaring of the case in such manner, the belt includes VELCRO\u2122, or hook and loop fastener sections.

FIG. 9 is a schematic picture showing a pouch that can be attached to the make-up case of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 illustrate a square embodiment of the make-up case of this invention in an open position. In this embodiment the case 100 is generally rectangular in shape, and preferably, a square. It comprises two compartments 1 and 2 , connected with a hinge 3 , so as to allow a reciprocal movement therebetween. The compartment 1 is designed to hold inserts 4 preferably containing eye shadows, lip color concealer, mascara and other cosmetic supplies, except powder. Compartment 1 further comprises a brush holder section 5 designed to hold any kind of brush used in applying cosmetics. For example, section 5 can be split in two parts: one for an eye shadow brush and another for a lip brush, and a clip can be provided in the middle of section 5 (not shown) to hold the brush or brushes. The combination of the supplies, as well as the choice of particular brushes can be made according to particular tastes and needs of the user. Those skilled in the art will choose a proper combination of inserts and brushes. Compartment 2 comprises a tray 6 designed to hold compact powder. Any kind of powder ordinarily used can be placed in tray 6. Those skilled in the art will select proper powder which best suits their particular needs. Compartments 1 and 2 are separated by a divider 7 , connected to the make-up case by using the same hinge 3. At least one side of the divider 7 is preferably a reflective surface and either side of the divider can serve as a mirror. When the kit 100 is opened, compartments 1 and 2 are moved relatively to each other around the hinge 3 , until they are positioned in the same plane, as shown on FIG. 1. In such position, the divider 7 lies flat against the top surface of either compartment 1 (when the powder from compartment 2 is used) or compartment 2 (when the supplies from compartment 1 are used), as the case may be. When the user applies the supplies from either compartment, she uses one surface of the divider 7 as a mirror. When the user has completed using the supplies from a compartment, she rotates the divider 7 on the hinge 3 , covering this compartment and opening the other compartment (previously covered by the divider 7 ), followed by using the cosmetics from the other compartment. The other surface of the divider 7 can again be used as a mirror. Compartments 1 and 2 can be made of any size as selected. However, the sizes of compartments 1 and 2 should be preferably substantially identical to allow the kit 100 to be safely closed."

  "query": "What innovations exist to enhance the aesthetic appearance of a dancer's foot when traditional pointe shoes reveal the true shape?,",
  "negative": "The technology pertains broadly to physical performance arts and specifically to innovations in the comfort of a performer's foot. While the appearance of an artist\u2019s foot is not highlighted in every form of dance, for those where it is, the comfort and functionality are also critical. A key issue is the capability of the footwear to provide comfort while maintaining the visual symmetry and form required by the art form. Existing inventions fail to consider the dancer's comfort while optimizing for visual attributes. For instance, an artist may have to endure discomfort in pointe shoes due to the design focusing entirely on visual appeal and conformity to the foot's arch, neglecting the necessary cushioning and support. As a result, various modifications to footwear aesthetics have been proposed, including employing transparent materials and designing a more ergonomically shaped insole that supports the foot's natural structure during performances. However, these solutions do not address providing lasting comfort for hours of rehearsals or performances. In consideration of this gap, there's a need for ergonomic pointe shoes designed to bolster the performer's comfort without compromising the requisite visual aspects of the performance. By introducing an adaptive insole that accommodates a range of foot shapes and sizes, and utilizing materials that cushion while enhancing the foot's outline, performers can execute demanding routines without the physical toll commonly endured. No existing patents or prior art perfectly address the integrated approach of enhancing aesthetics, comfort, and performance, which is the core of such an innovative footwear design.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the dance arts and more particularly to improvements in the appearance of a dancer&#39;s foot. BACKGROUND In the dance arts such as ballet, modern dance, jazz and the like, the physical attributes of the dancer are of utmost importance. Desirable physical attributes of a dancer include a small to medium sized head, a long neck, proportionate torso, long legs which \u201cturn out,\u201d and most importantly, beautiful feet. The single most defining characteristic of a beautiful foot for dance purposes is the shape and extent of the arch. A well defined arch is known in the art as a \u201cbanana foot,\u201d referring to a foot with a marked arch on the bottom of the foot and a complementary smooth radius shape to the top or instep of the foot. Such a foot thus resembles the shape of a banana. Sadly, the opportunities for a dancer are often limited by the dancer&#39;s lack of the physical attributes just noted, especially in the area of the feet. For example, a dancer with exceptional dance abilities but who has relatively flat feet may be denied entrance to summer programs as a child, later be denied entrance into dance programs at universities, and ultimately be denied the opportunity to dance professionally. These opportunities are lost not because of the lack of dance ability, but rather because of a lack of an aesthetically pleasing foot. U.S. Pat. No. 326,728 (J. J. Georges) discloses a pad attached to the top of the foot by straps for the purpose of giving a foot covered by a shoe a comely shape and preventing it from moving or sliding in a shoe or boot. The patent teaches that the shoe covers the pad. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 147,698 (J. B. Smith) and U.S. Pat. No. 374,106 (C. H. Winter) disclose pads to improve the form of the foot and to protect the foot from the laces of the shoe. In these patents, the shoe covers the pad and assists in holding same in place. Other patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 1,901,658 (F. A. Larack) and U.S. Pat. No. 2,090,573 (F. D. &#39;Alessandro) address the discomfort a woman suffers in traditional high heeled shoes by providing cushioning pads or instep protectors that fit under the vamp portion of the high heeled shoe. The prior art just noted teaches covering the foot with a traditional shoe or teaches relieving rubbing and irritation of the foot caused by the vamp of a high heeled shoe. However, the prior art above does not address improving the look of a substantially uncovered foot such as that of a dancer wearing a ballet slipper or pointe shoe. Further, quite unlike the shoes disclosed by the prior art just noted, a dance or \u201cpointe shoe\u201d conforms to the arch of the foot, thereby providing little no support to the dancer&#39;s arch and thus revealing the true shape of the bottom of the dancer&#39;s foot. If the dancer&#39;s foot be flat, a pointe shoe will reveal it. More specifically, every time a dancer&#39;s foot is off the floor, it is pointed, thereby revealing the arch, or lack thereof. What is needed is a way to improve the look of a dancer&#39;s foot that is undetectable and that does not impede the dancer&#39;s ability to perform intricate dance movements. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an apparatus and method for improving the appearance of a dancer&#39;s feet. By attaching a pad that has a curved top surface to the top of a dancer&#39;s foot, the shape of the top of the dancer&#39;s foot is improved. Additionally, the arch on the bottom of the foot appears more marked. The present invention can be employed with a wide variety of dance shoes and outfits to improve the appearance of a dancer&#39;s feet. In one form thereof, the invention resides in the combination of a dance shoe and a pad that is attached to the dancer&#39;s foot. The dance shoe comprises a fabric material adapted to partially cover the foot of its wearer. A flexible sole is disposed on the bottom of the fabric and is adapted to conform to the shape of the arch of the foot. The fabric material terminates in a border which further defines an open top of the shoe and which is adapted to substantially expose the top or instep of the foot. The border also defines a vamp adapted to cover the toes. The pad is formed from a resilient and deformable material and is sized to substantially cover the top of the foot. The pad has an edge portion sized to be concealed under the border, whereby, when worn, the pad is substantially uncovered by the shoe and the shape and thickness of the pad augments the appearance of the top and bottom of the foot. In a preferred form, the dance shoe further comprises a ribbon which is adapted to further conceal the edge of the pad. Ideally, the edge of the pad is either covered by the ribbon from the dance shoe or the border of the dance shoe, thereby being very difficult to detect and thus giving the foot a natural looking and aesthetically pleasing appearance. The curved appearance to the top of the foot is achieved by a pad whose top surface is curved, the pad tapering in thickness from its center to the edge. More preferably, the pad can be made of foam or other suitable soft, resilient and lightweight material. This material is encased in cloth or fabric having a skin color. The pad includes a stretchable band attached thereto that is adapted to be placed around the foot and hold the pad in place. In another form thereof, the present invention provides a method of wearing a dance outfit to augment the appearance of a dancer&#39;s foot. According to this method, a pad is attached to the top of the foot and thereby covers a portion of the top of the foot. A tight is donned over the pad, whereby the pad is concealed by the tight. Finally, a dance shoe having a substantially open top is worn over the tight, the pad being substantially or totally uncovered by the dance shoe. In this method, the top surface of the pad defines what appears to be the top profile of the dancer&#39;s foot and the pad thus enhances the appearance of the top and bottom of the dancer&#39;s foot. More preferably, the method includes covering the side edges of the pad with the border of the shoe, the front edge of the pad with the vamp of the shoe, and the back edge of the pad with a ribbon of the shoe. In this manner, the edges of the pad are totally concealed from view and the pad is thus difficult to detect. Instead, the top of the dancer&#39;s foot appears as though it were more curved than it actually is. One advantage of the present invention is that it improves the appearance of a dancer&#39;s foot yet does not interfere with intricate dance maneuvers such as bris\u00e9, entrechat quatre and the like that a dancer must perform. The dancer simply puts the inventive augmentation pad on before his or her tights and then performs as usual. The pad is so comfortable and subtle that dancers forget they are wearing it. Another advantage of the present invention is that it can be used with a wide variety of commercially available dance shoes. The inventive pad of the present invention conveniently tucks under the border of many available dance shoes and in some shoes is in part concealed by the dance shoe&#39;s ribbon. The effect is that the dancer&#39;s foot appears more like a desirable \u201cbanana foot.\u201d Yet another advantage of the present invention is its cost. The pad of the present invention can be simply and cost-effectively manufactured from a variety of suitable materials. Still another advantage of the present invention is that it may afford career opportunities to a dancer with outstanding dance abilities but uncomely feet. By improving the aesthetic appearance of a dancer&#39;s feet, the present invention can remove a significant obstacle to gaining entrance into a dance school or gaining a part in a performance. A dancer using the present invention can compete with dancers who were naturally endowed with more aesthetically pleasing feet. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS The above-mentioned and other advantages of the present invention, and the manner of obtaining them, will become more apparent and the invention itself will be better understood by reference to the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1A is a perspective view of a classically shaped dancer&#39;s foot wearing a traditional pointe shoe; FIG. 1B is a perspective view of a dancer&#39;s foot that lacks some of the aesthetically pleasing qualities of the foot depicted in FIG. 1A, but is shown wearing the same pointe shoe as depicted in FIG. 1A; FIG. 1C is a perspective view of the dancer&#39;s foot of FIG. 1A with the foot in a different position and illustrating the sole of the foot and shoe; FIG. 1D is a perspective view of a dancer&#39;s foot shown wearing a ballet slipper; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a dancer&#39;s foot shown wearing a pointe shoe and illustrating in phantom lines the pad in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 2A is a perspective view of the dancer&#39;s foot of FIG. 2 illustrating in phantom the actual profile of the dancer&#39;s foot; FIG. 3 is a perspective of a dancer&#39;s foot wearing a pointe shoe taken from above and illustrating the pad in accordance with the present invention in phantom; FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing a pad in accordance with the present invention removed from a dancer&#39;s foot; FIG. 5 is a plan view in partial cross section showing a pad in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 6A is a perspective view of a dancer wearing tights having a pocket for receipt of a pad in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 6B is a perspective view in partial cross section illustrating an alternate embodiment of a pad in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 6C is a perspective view in partial cross section illustrating an alternate embodiment of a pad in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 6D is a perspective view of a dancer wearing a pad which adheres directly to the skin in accordance with the present invention; FIGS. 7-9 are perspective views illustrating a method of assembling a dance outfit in accordance with the present invention; and FIGS. 10-13 are perspective views illustrating an alternate method of assembling a dance outfit in accordance with the present invention with a convertible tight.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The embodiments of the present invention described below are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed in the following detailed description. Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled in the art may appreciate and understand the principles and practices of the present invention. Referring now to FIG. 1A, a dancer&#39;s foot 20 is depicted wearing a pointe shoe 22. As can be seen, the dancer&#39;s arch 24 is pronounced and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, the dancer&#39;s instep 26 or top of the foot is also well-rounded and is therefore aesthetically pleasing. In stark contrast to the foot 20 depicted in FIG. 1A, foot 28 shown in FIG. 1B would not be generally regarded as aesthetically pleasing, even though foot 28 is shown wearing the same pointe shoe 22 as in FIG. 1 A. Foot 28 has a poor or flat arch 30 and a substantially flat instep 32. The opportunities for the dancer possessing foot 28 would probably be much more limited than the opportunities presented to the dancer possessing foot 20 , even assuming their respective dance abilities were equivalent. As shown in FIG. 1C, pointe shoe 22 has sole 33 that substantially conforms to the bottom of the dancer&#39;s foot. In FIG. 1D dance shoe 34 has bifurcated soles 36 and 38 such that the fabric of shoe 34 substantially conforms to arch 24. With any of these prior art dance shoes, the shape of the bottom of the foot will be seen by the audience watching the dancer because the bottom of the dance shoe substantially conforms to the bottom of the dancer&#39;s foot. If the foot be aesthetically pleasing, this is desirable. On the other hand, if the dancer&#39;s foot is flat or otherwise unattractive, the dance shoe will reveal it. It is to be understood that the term \u201cdance shoe\u201d is to be construed broadly to cover pointe shoes, soft shoes and other shoes worn in dance wherein the top or instep of the foot is substantially uncovered. It is also to be understood that the term \u201cdance routine\u201d as used herein is to be construed broadly, ranging from an entire performance to single dance maneuvers, such as bris\u00e9, entrechat quatre and the like. Turning now to FIG. 2 and FIG. 2A, it has been found that the appearance of a dancer&#39;s foot 28 wearing pointe shoe 22 may be enhanced by attaching a pad 40 of the present invention to the top or instep of the foot. FIGS. 2 and 2A depict the dancer&#39;s foot in the pointe position, the familiar ballet position in which the body is balanced on the extreme tips of the toes. For purposes of this specification, the term \u201cattached\u201d and derivatives thereof when used in connection with pad 40 is to be construed broadly to cover any means or method of substantially fixing in place or adhering pad 40 against the foot. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 2A, instep 32 has been actually physically augmented by pad 40. Surprisingly, however, it has been found in practice that the appearance of arch 30 has also been enhanced, even though no augmentation had been performed directly upon arch 30. It is believed that the enhanced appearance of arch 30 is achieved by the \u201cmind&#39;s eye\u201d viewing the entire foot as a composite and thus incorporating the augmentation of instep 32 into arch 30. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 2A and more particularly in FIG. 3, pointe shoe 22 includes a fabric material 42 , preferably satin, which is adapted to partially cover foot 28. A flexible sole 44 made preferably from leather is typically sewn or glued on the bottom of fabric material 42 , as is known in the art. As mentioned above, sole 44 conforms to the shape of the arch 30 of the foot and provides little or no support therefor, such that the true shape of the arch is revealed. A shank is provided in the inside of shoe 22 (not shown), but such shank provides little support. Fabric material 42 terminates in a border 46 which further defines an open top 48 adapted to substantially expose the top or instep 32 of foot 28 , as is seen in FIG. 3. Border 46 can be formed of a piece of fabric sewn around the periphery of opening 48. As shown in FIG. 3, border 46 defines a vamp 50 that covers the toes of the foot. Pad 40 is formed of a resilient and deformable material that is sized to cover the top or instep 32 of foot 28. Pad 40 has an outer periphery or edge portion 52 that is concealed under border 46 , which makes the existence of pad 40 difficult to detect. Preferably, edge portion 52 is covered at least in part by ribbons 54 , thereby further concealing the existence of pad 40. Optionally, edge portion 52 of pad 40 can be sewn into border 46 of pointe shoe 22 (not shown). Typically, however, pad 40 is formed separate from shoe 22 such that pad 40 can be used with a variety of commercially available shoes. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, pad 40 includes a foam or other material 56 encased or sewn into a fabric 58 , which is preferably of skin color to conceal the existence of pad 40. The material 56 must be flexible and resilient, conforming to the dancer&#39;s foot, maintaining its shape, but not interfering with the dancer&#39;s intricate movements, such as bris\u00e9, entrechat quatre and the like. Material 56 should be of light weight. Many suitable materials can be used for insert 56 , such as foam having a wide variety of density, resilient polymers, open celled polymers, gel-pads, visco-elastic materials, conventional stuffings such as hair or feathers, and many other suitable materials. Optionally, pad 40 can be formed of a unitary material, thereby obviating fabric 58. Pad 40 should be soft, lightweight, resilient, flexible and preferably washable. As shown in FIG. 5, material 56 and thus pad 40 gradually taper in a direction outwardly from the center. The taper occurs both front and back as well as side to side. The tapering thickness provides the appearance of curvature to the top of the foot that is otherwise lacking, and also makes the bottom or arch of the foot appear more pronounced. Surprisingly, a \u201cbubble effect\u201d has been observed by virtue of the border 52 pressing down on pad 40 around its edges. That is to say, the curvature or roundness of the exposed part of pad 40 becomes more pronounced when the edges of pad 40 are pressed by border 52. This enhances the aesthetically pleasing look of the dancer&#39;s foot. Pad 40 also preferably includes an elastic band 60 which is placed around the foot and holds pad 40 in place as shown in FIG. 7. Band 60 can be made of elastic or other suitable stretchable material."

  "negative": "The present disclosure outlines a method for the synthesis of phosphatide analogs in a completely non-aqueous system. This methodology involves the use of a catalyst other than phospholipase D, derived from alternative microbial sources, which facilitates the reaction in an organic solvent medium. Key substrates utilized include various alcohol-bearing compounds, but exclude primary or secondary alcoholic groups. The process additionally involves subsequent purification steps to achieve a product that is characterized by its structure rather than its purity or peroxidation levels. Moreover, this technique does not utilize phosphatidylcholine or any similar compounds, focusing instead on a different class of phosphatide analogs, and it does not guarantee high yields or the prevention of peroxidation issues seen in traditional methods. Detailed protocols for synthesizing phosphatides using this alternative approach are set forth, detailing the reaction conditions but not directly comparing them to those used in aqueous phases. Furthermore, the document provides an outline for how to create compositions for industrial applications that rely on these phosphatide analogs, although not specifically for food, dietary, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic uses due to potential variations in palatability and chemical properties.\n\n",
  "pos": "SUBJECT OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns a process for the preparation of pure phosphatides starting from mixtures of natural phosphatides, or their single components, such as soybean or egg lecithin or animal phospholipids, or from synthetic phosphatides by reacting them with phospholipase D, with transphosphatidylation activity, in aqueous medium alone in the presence of defined substrates containing a primary or a secondary alcoholic group. The invention also refers to the preparation, purification and characterisation of the phospholipase D used in the process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The synthesis of pure phospholipids, particularly on an industrial scale, is a particularly widespread problem. Indeed, there have been numerous scientific publications and patents, including some very recent ones that describe various methodologies. Generally, said methods exploit the transphosphatidylation properties of phospholipase D to obtain optically active phosphatides. One of the main problems is the fact that each of these methods is suited to the preparation of one specific phosphatide alone and cannot be adapted for the synthesis of the whole class of compounds. Generally, the most widely studied phospholipid is phosphatidylserine (PS), as it is widely used in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, in the preparation of liposome formulations and food supplements. Relatively little or nothing is reported concerning the synthesis of sphingophospholipids. One limitation of all the methods reported in both the scientific and patent literature consists in the fact that the reaction of transphosphatidylation occurs in diphasic water/organic solvent systems. This presents a series of technical problems linked with the use of large quantities of solvent, especially when the industrial process is of a chemical nature, aimed at obtaining a quality product. In patent application No. DE 19917249 A1, a method is described that actually employs the aqueous phase alone, but neither the yield nor degree of purity of the PS obtained, nor the type of the utilised enzyme is reported. Moreover, there is no mention of whether it is possible to obtain other phospholipids besides PS by using the same technique and starting from the substrates used, or whether in the conditions described other phospholipids can act as reaction substrate. Japanese Patent Publication No. 5/42917 (JP 2130088) also discloses a method employing a medium comprised of water alone or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. However, this patent states that the water content is favored to be 10% by weight or less to prevent a side reaction. This reference, therefore, appears to suggest that using an aqueous environment alone is not favorable. In fact, the examples therein disclose only processes employing a biphasic mixture of water and ethyl ether. The generic nature of the information given or absence of teaching in the aforesaid prior art concerning the applicability of the transphosphatidylation reaction of phospholipase D in aqueous phase alone could in no way have led an expert in the field to think that this was the solution to the problem. Moreover, the importance of removing impurities deriving from the use of organic solvents in processes for the manufacture of products for use in the alimentary and pharmaceutical fields has only become known in recent years, following the limitations dictated by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) and the European guidelines (CPMP/CH/283/95). Another critical point that has not been investigated in-depth, either in the scientific literature or in patents, concerns the peroxidation of products caused by the use of heterogeneous phases of water/solvent in emulsion during the transphosphatidylation reaction, the reaction conditions used and the consequent need to perform numerous steps of the process (re-precipitation, washings and possibly also chromatography) to obtain products with a high degree of purity. Many of the solvents used for these reactions in the heterogeneous phase do not guarantee the absence of radicalic precursors typical of the initiation of the peroxidation reaction. Moreover, the shaking/stirring required to achieve a reaction in the heterogeneous phase increases the likelihood of there being contact with oxygen in the atmosphere and consequent triggering of oxidative phenomena. This peroxidation acts like a chain reaction, when even negligible initial primer steps can give devastating results over time, even though the triggering conditions have been eliminated or minimised. The peroxidation of a \u201cfatty\u201d substance such as triglycerides (oils or fats) and phospholipids too, causes the fatty acids to become \u201crancid\u201d, with the consequent formation of an unpleasant smell and taste. It is particularly important that the products should have a high degree of palatability (smell and taste) when they, particularly PS, are used to prepare food supplements (nutraceuticals) with particular formulations such as granules or the so-called \u201cfunctional foods\u201d, to which the product is added to enrich their content. Consequently, it is important that the products obtained, particularly PS, should be clearly characterised in chemical terms, both with regard to the chemical composition of the fatty acids, and for the extent of their peroxidation and consequent palatability. Lastly, it should be pointed out that the phospholipase D enzymes available on the market mainly have transphosphatidylation activity on the phosphatidylcholine fraction of the phospholipid mixture. Therefore, the other components such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) undergo hydrolysis to phosphatidic acid, thus reducing both the yield and the degree of purity of the finished product. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, the Applicant has discovered that by using a purified fraction of phospholipase D from Streptoverticillium hachijoense (n/k/a Streptomyces hachijoense ) it is possible to obtain a transphosphatidylation reaction with various alcoholic receptors starting from a mixture of natural phosphatides or their purified fractions in a 100% aqueous environment with high yields of product, a high degree of purity and a peroxide index (degree of peroxidation) of less than 5, established according to the European Pharmacopoeia\u2014Suppl 2000, page 41 (method A), by one single reaction step and one single precipitation. A second aspect of the present invention consists in the fact that this particular enzymatic preparation has a transphosphatidylation activity with high yields even on substrates other than phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), thus enabling the process to be used with low-cost, unpurified raw materials too. The importance of the strain used for the preparation of the Phospholipase D and its fractionation can be deduced from the following table, where a comparison with different commercial enzymatic preparations is reported for the purified enzymatic fraction prepared according to Example 1.

A third aspect of the present invention concerns the preparation of pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions and food and dietary supplements based on phospholipids, obtained according to the process described above, having a degree of peroxidation of less than 5 and a high degree of palatability, such as to make them preferable to other, similar products on the market that do not however have the above said characteristics. The pharmaceutical compositions and the food and dietary supplements are particularly indicated in the treatment of conditions of psycho-physical stress with attention, concentration and memory deficits, often associated with advancing age, and they can be prepared, for example, in the form of capsules, tablets and granules. The cosmetic compositions can chiefly be applied in the treatment of skin with impaired physiological functions and as aids in the therapy of dermatitis of an eczematous and/or inflammatory type, and they can be prepared, for example, in the form of creams or gels. For purely illustrative purposes, we report hereafter some preparation examples of Phospholipase D and phospholipids derived from it according to the present invention EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Phospholipase D The Streptoverticillium hachijoense ATCC 19769 strain is used. Preparation of the inoculation to be used in the fermentation test begins with a colony on solid medium in a Petri dish. The composition of the solid medium is as follows: 21.0 g/liter Y.M., 2% agar. The bacteria taken from the Petri dishes are used to start a \u201cscale-up\u201d system in Ehrlenmeyer flasks as follows: the bacteria are taken from the solid medium with a sterile platinum loop and inoculated in a 100-ml flask containing 20 ml of medium with the following composition: 21.0 g/lt of Y. M. broth; the flask is placed in a shaker incubator set at 30\u00b0 C., 150 rpm for 48 hours; 20 ml of culture is transferred to a 5.0-lt flask containing 2.5 It of medium with the composition described above; the flask is placed in a shaker incubator set at 30\u00b0 C., 150 rpm for 72 hours. At this point the culture is ready to be inoculated in the fermenter. This operation is made possible by the fact that the culture is in a flask fitted with a silicone tube and needle system. The fermenter used has a capacity of 50 lt (Braun Biostat U). The composition of the medium is as follows: Y.M. broth 21.0 gr/lt, pH 6.5 (the medium is sterilised directly in the fermenter by the addition of an antifoaming agent); the parameters of fermentation are: shaking at 200 rpm, temperature 30\u00b0 C., air flow 0.5 vvm. After 72 hours fermentation is interrupted. The maximum amount of enzyme reached is 5,000 U/It and enzymatic activity is determined by the modified method of Kato et al. described in the literature (K. Shimbo et al., Agric. Biol. Chem. 54(5), 1189-93, 1990). The culture broth is filtered to eliminate the biomass, the supernatant is concentrated using a spiral cartridge in cellulose acetate with a molecular cut-off of 10,000 D, and dialised against 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The sample thus obtained is loaded on a chromatographic column (i.d.=10 cm, h=50 cm) packed with 500 gr of Whatman DE-52 anion-exchange resin pre-balanced with the same buffer as was used for dialysis. The enzyme is not adsorbed and elutes from the column, it is dialised against 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 5.4 and is then loaded on a chromatographic column (i.d.=10 cm, h=50 cm) packed with 50 gr of cationic exchange resin CM-Sephadex Pharmacia C-50 pre-balanced with the same buffer as the enzyme. The enzyme is eluted with a pH gradient of between 5.4 and 7.0 using an Na-phosphate buffer, 20 mM, pH7.0. The fraction that elutes at pH 6.2 is harvested, concentrated and dialised against Tris-HCl buffer, 50 mM, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 100 U/ml and then freeze-dried.

The pH is adjusted to 5.6 (acetate buffer, 0.2 M+calcium chloride, 0.04 M, pH 5.6) and 5.0 kg of L-serine is added and solubilised by heating to 45\u00b0 C. The entire process is conducted under nitrogen. Once solubilisation is complete, 1.5 kg of purified soybean lecithin with the following composition is added: PC 95%, PA 4%, lyso-PC 1%. Ten minutes later, 16,100 U of phopholipase D as in example 1 are added, and this is left to react for 24 hours at 45\u00b0 C. On completion of the reaction, the reactor is unloaded by adding 10 it of a mixture of n-hexane/ispropanol/water (60/80/15); the mass is dissolved by shaking, then the shaking is stopped and the two phases are left to separate. The lower phase is harvested and the unreacted L-serine is recovered by cooling in a crystallizer. The upper phase is washed with 6,950 ml of HCl, 1 N and 1,113 ml of isopropanol at 5\u00b0 C. The acid phase is counter-extracted with 10 lt of a mixture of hexane/isopropanol/water (60/80/15), after which the two organic phases are cascade-washed with a mixture of 7 lt of water and 6 lt of isopropanol. The organic phases are concentrated under vacuum and precipitated by slowly adding a solution of 450 ml of sodium acetate, 4.5 M, in water in 33.2 lt of ethanol. This is filtered and dried. 1.14 kg of phosphatidylserine with a titer of over 95%, a phosphatidic acid content of less than 5% and a peroxide index of less than 5 is obtained. After crystallisation and drying, 3.25 kg of L-serine is harvested. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of PS from Egg Lecithin 180 ml of acetate buffer, 0.2 M+calcium chloride, 0.04 M, pH 5.6, are placed n a jacketed reactor with a shaker and reflux condenser, after which 90 gr of L-serine is added and solubilised by heating to 45\u00b0 C. The entire process is conducted under nitrogen. Once solubilisation is complete, 27 gr of purified egg lecithin is added (PC content\u226795%); 10 minutes later, 290 U of phospholipase D as per example 1 is added and it is left to react for 24 hours at 45\u00b0 C. Once the reaction is complete, the reactor is unloaded by adding 200 ml of a mixture of n-hexane/isopropanol/water (60/80/15) and the mass is dissolved by shaking, then the shaking is stopped and the two phases are left to separate. The lower phase is discarded. The upper phase is washed with 150 ml of 1 N HCl and 30 ml of isopropanol at 5\u00b0 C. The acid phase is counterextracted with 180 ml of a mixture of n-hexane/isopropanol/water (60/80/15), then the two organic phases are washed in a cascade with a mixture of 100 ml water and 130 ml of isopropanol The organic phases are concentrated under vacuum and precipitated by the slow addition of a solution of 8 ml of 4.5 M sodium acetate in water in 600 ml of ethanol. It is filtered and dried. This yields 20.8 g of phosphatidylserine with a titer of over 95% with a phosphatidic acid content of less than 5% and a peroxide index of less than 5. EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of Phosphatidylserine from Crude Soybean Lecithin 180 ml of acetate buffer, 0.2 M+calcium chloride, 0.04 M, pH 5.6 are placed in a jacketed reactor with a shaker and reflux condenser, after which 90 g of L-serine is added and solubilised by heating to 45\u00b0 C. The entire process is conducted under nitrogen. Once solubilisation is complete, 27 g of crude soybean lecithin is added (total phospholipid content 75%, percentage composition PC 60.6/PE 29.5/PA 3.4/lyso-PC 2.5/other 3.9)); 10 minutes later, 290 U of phospholipase D as per example 1 is added and this is left to react for 24 hours at 45\u00b0 C. Once the reaction is complete, the solution is unloaded by adding 200 ml of a mixture of n-hexane/isopropanol/water (60/80/15) into the reactor and the mass is dissolved by shaking, then the shaking is stopped and the two phases are left to separate. The lower phase is discarded. The upper phase is washed with 150 ml of 1 N HCl and 30 ml of isopropanol at 5\u00b0 C.

  "pos": "[0001] The present application claims the benefit of provisional Application No, 61/449,012, filed Mar. 3, 2011; which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present invention generally relates to a fixation device used to facilitate reduction and repair of a fractured bone. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bone plate for creating a mechanically stronger connection between the bone plate and portions of a fractured humerus including the proximal humerus and the humeral shaft. More specifically, the present invention relates to a bone plate configured to provide optimal angles for bone screws received therethrough to decrease the incidence of penetration of the bone screws through the articular surface of the humeral head. [0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art [0005] Current state of the art in surgical fracture fixation of the proximal humerus requires the application of a bone plate to the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus. To attach the bone plate to the proximal humerus, bone screws (threadably or non-threadably engaging the bone plate) are inserted through the bone plate into the proximal humerus. In attaching the bone plate to the proximal humerus, the bone screws are ultimately received under the surface of the humeral head. [0006] The bone screws used to attach the bone plate to the proximal humerus will likely be disposed at a significantly perpendicular angle with respect to the articular surface of the humeral head. This attachment orientation provides insufficient mechanical strength to maintain rigid attachment of the bone plate to the proximal humerus when subjected to joint reaction forces. As such, there remains a significant incidence of loss of fracture reduction and fracture fixation. In order to maximize stability of the connection, it is necessary to utilize long bone screws, so as to maximize the purchase thereof. However, given the significantly perpendicular angle of the bone screws relative to the articular surface, if there is any collapse or subsidence of the humeral head relative to the bone plate, the tips of the bone screws will penetrate the articular surface. Accordingly, there also remains a significant incidence of joint penetration. [0007] Therefore, there is a need for a fixation device and method of use associated therewith that provides more optimal screw angles with respect to the articular surface of the humeral head and a mechanically stronger connection between the bone plate and the humerus. Such a fixation device can insure that bone screws are disposed at varying angles that are more tangential to the articular surface to prevent loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction, and/or prevent penetration of the bone screws through the articular surface of the humeral head. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] The present invention in a preferred embodiment contemplates a fixation device for facilitating reductions and repair of a fractured humerus, the fixation device including a bone plate adapted to overlie and contact portions of a proximal humerus and a humeral shaft, the bone plate having a body portion, a neck portion, and a first end portion, the body portion including a first end, a second end opposite the first end, a longitudinal axis extending between the first and second ends, a plurality of bone screw receiving apertures adapted to overlie the humeral shaft, and a first contact surface adapted to contact the exterior surface of the humeral shaft, the longitudinal axis of the body portion being adapted to be substantially aligned with the humeral shaft when the bone plate is attached to the humerus, the neck portion extending from the body portion, the neck portion being adapted to bridge the biceps groove of the proximal humerus when the bone plate is attached to the humerus, the first end portion being contiguous to the neck portion, the first end portion including a second contact surface adapted to contact the exterior surface of the lesser tuberosity of the proximal humerus, and at least two bone screw receiving apertures adapted to overlie the lesser tuberosity, the at least two bone screw receiving apertures each including an axis, the axes of the at least two bone receiving apertures being oriented away from the articular surface of the proximal humerus when the bone plate is attached to the humerus; at least a first set of bone screws, a first bone screw of the first set of bone screws being received through a first of the plurality of bone screw receiving apertures and into the humeral shaft, and a second bone screw of the first set of bone screws being received through a second of the plurality of bone screw receiving apertures and into the humeral shaft, the first and second bone screws of the first set of bone screws facilitating attached of the bone portion to the humeral shaft; and at least a second set of bone screws, each bone screw of the at least a second set of bone screws having a longitudinal axis, a first bone screw of the second set of bone screws being received through a first of the at least two bone screw receiving apertures and into the lessor tuberosity, a second bone screw of the second set of bone screws being received through a second of the at least two bone screw receiving apertures and into the lessor tuberosity, the longitudinal axes of the first and second bone screws of the second set of bone screws being aligned with the axes of the first and second bone screw receiving apertures and being oriented away from the articular surface of the proximal humerus when the bone plate is attached to the humerus.

[0010] It is understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and exemplary only, and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0011] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention. Together with the description, they serve to explain the objects, advantages and principles of the invention. In the drawings: [0012] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a left proximal humerus; [0013] FIG. 2 is a top view of the left proximal humerus depicted in FIG. 1 ; [0014] FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a bone plate of a first embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention positioned with respect to the proximal humerus; [0015] FIG. 3A is a perspective view of the fixation device of FIG. 3 depicting the placement of bone screws used in the fixation device; [0016] FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a bone plate of a second embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention positioned with respect to the proximal humerus; [0017] FIG. 4A is a perspective view of the fixation device of FIG. 4 depicting the placement of bone screws used in the fixation device; [0018] FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a bone plate of a third embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention positioned with respect to the proximal humerus; [0019] FIG. 5A is a perspective view of the fixation device of FIG. 5 depicting the placement of bone screws used in the fixation device; and [0020] FIG. 6 is a top cross-sectional view of the fixation device depicted in FIG. 5A taken through the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity, and a portion of the fixation device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0021] The following description is intended to be representative only and not limiting, and many variations can be anticipated according to these teachings. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of this invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. [0022] FIGS. 1 and 2 depict the portions of a left proximal humerus generally indicated by the numeral 10. Proximal humerus 10 is joined to humeral shaft 12 ( FIG. 1 ), and includes greater tuberosity 14 , lesser tuberosity 16 , biceps groove 18 , humeral head 20 , and an articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. Biceps groove 18 is disposed between greater tuberosity 14 and lesser tuberosity 16. Thus, as depicted in FIG. 2 , greater tuberosity 14 is disposed laterally of biceps groove 18 , and lesser tuberosity 16 is disposed medially of biceps groove 18. Furthermore, in FIGS. 3-5A , lesser tuberosity 16 is partially covered by the fixation devices of the present invention. Thus, the lead line associated with numeral 16 in FIGS. 3-5A points to proximal humerus 10 adjacent where fixation devices of the present invention are positioned. [0023] As discussed above, to facilitate fracture fixation and fracture reduction, a bone plate typically has been attached to greater tuberosity 14. However, the placement of bone screws by the bone plate attached solely to greater tuberosity 14 is less than optimal. The bone screws will likely be disposed at a significantly perpendicular angle with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20 , and thus, cause a significant incidence of penetration of articular surface 22. [0024] A first embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention is generally indicated by the numeral 30 in FIGS. 3 and 3A. Fixation device 30 includes a \u201cdogleg-shaped\u201d bone plate 31 and various bone screws inserted therethrough and into bone. [0025] Bone plate 31 has a body portion 32 , a neck portion 34 , and an end portion 36. Body portion 32 includes apertures 40 spaced therealong, and is attached to humeral shaft 12 and portions of proximal humerus 10 using bone screws 41 ( FIG. 3A ) inserted through apertures 40 and into the bone. As depicted in FIGS. 3 and 3A , neck portion 34 extends from body portion 32 over biceps groove 18 , and terminates at end portion 36. End portion 36 includes apertures 42 spaced apart thereon, and is attached to lesser tuberosity 16 using bone screws 43 ( FIG. 3A ) inserted through apertures 42 and into proximal humerus 10. Apertures 40 and 42 extend between an upper surface 44 and a lower surface (not shown) of bone plate 31. The lower surface of bone plate 31 can be contoured according to the surfaces of proximal humerus 10 to provide a flush interface therebetween. [0026] Apertures 42 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 31 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 43 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 42. The angles of the longitudinal axis of apertures 42 serve to orient bone screws 43 in positions that inhibit the incidence of penetration thereof through articular surface 22. For example, the orientation angles afforded by apertures 42 serve to position bone screws 43 in at least substantially tangential orientations with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. Accordingly, the axes of apertures 42 and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 43 received therein can be oriented away from and avoid intersection with articular surface 22 , thereby decreasing the incidence of penetration of bone screws 43 through articular surface 22 , while also preventing a loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction. [0027] A second embodiment of a fixation device according to the present invention is generally indicated by the numeral 50 in FIGS. 4 and 4 k Fixation device 50 includes an \u201ch-shaped\u201d bone plate 51 and various screws inserted therethrough and into bone. [0028] Bone plate 51 has a body portion 52 , a neck portion 54 , a first end portion 56 , and a second end portion 58. Body portion 52 includes apertures 60 spaced therealong, and is attached to humeral shaft 12 and portions of proximal humerus 10 using bone screws 61 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 60 and into the bone. As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 4A , first end portion 56 is contiguous with body portion 52 , and includes apertures 62 spaced apart thereon. First end portion 56 is attached to greater tuberosity 14 using bone screws 63 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 62 and into proximal humerus 10. As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 4A , neck portion 54 extends from between body portion 52 and first end portion 56 over biceps groove 18 , and terminates at second end portion 58. Second end portion 58 includes apertures 64 spaced apart thereon, and is attached to lesser tuberosity 16 using bone screws 65 ( FIG. 4A ) inserted through apertures 64 and into proximal humerus 10. Apertures 60 , 62 , and 64 extend between an upper surface 66 and a lower surface (not shown) of bone plate 51. The lower surface of bone plate 51 can be contoured according to the surfaces of proximal humerus 10 to provide a flush interface therebetween. [0029] Apertures 62 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 51 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 63 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 62. As discussed below, use of second end portion 58 to facilitate attachment of bone plate 51 to proximal humerus 10 affords use of shorter bone screws 63 in apertures 62 than those typically used to secure attachment to greater tuberosity 14. [0030] Like apertures 62 , apertures 64 each include an axis substantially perpendicular to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of bone plate 51 adjacent thereto, and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 65 received therein are ultimately aligned with the axes of apertures 64. The angles of the axes of apertures 64 serve to orient bone screws 65 in positions that inhibit the incidence of penetration thereof through articular surface 22. For example, the orientation angles afforded by apertures 64 serve to position bone screws 65 in at least substantially tangential orientations with respect to articular surface 22 of humeral head 20. As such, the axes of apertures 64 and the longitudinal axes of bone screws 65 received therein can be oriented away from and avoid intersection with articular surface 22. Accordingly, such an orientation allows bone screws 63 inserted into lesser tuberosity 16 to share (with bone screws 63 ) in resisting the joint forces applied in a direction perpendicular to articular surface 22 , thereby decreasing the incidence of penetration of bone screws 63 through articular surface 22 , while also increasing the overall mechanical strength of the connection, preventing a loss of fracture fixation and fracture reduction. [0031] Because bone plate 51 is attached using (1) first end portion 56 to greater tuberosity 14 , and (2) using second end portion 58 to lesser tuberosity 16 , bone screws 63 used with apertures 62 can be shorter than those typically used to attach a bone plate solely to greater tuberosity 14."

  "negative": "The technological development focuses on methods for influencing physiological movements through minimal invasive techniques. Continuous efforts have led to advancements in the domain of muscular activation, particularly using embedded systems comprising various types of electrodes, such as cutaneous and intramuscular electrodes. The objective has been to devise better means to control and stimulate muscle fibers to assist in voluntary movements and organ functions, while mitigating discomfort linked to external apparatus connections. [0001] Innovations have introduced methods to surgically affix such stimulation devices internally, targeting the prevention of atrophy and the rehabilitation of muscle groups. Although these methods are promising, challenges persist around the energy requirements and the precision in the targeting of appropriate neuromuscular junctions. Internal systems must also address potential biological responses following long-term embedding. [0002] There is a clear propensity to optimize internal neurostimulation to benefit patients with motor deficits or involuntary muscle control issues. [0003] Non-invasive nerve stimulation techniques also exist but are hindered by suboptimal energy transfer, which necessitates an evaluation of the modes of application to enhance efficiency. [0004] It is evident that there is a continuous pursuit for methodological refinements in the delivery mechanisms for muscular and neural activation to achieve more natural and controlled bodily functions. [0005] Among the goals is to develop an approach that facilitates localized and precise influence on specific muscular and neural pathways, ensuring maximal therapeutic benefit for patients with involuntary muscle behavior. [0006] Overall, the aspiration of recent technological ventures is the creation of a symbiosis between machine and biological systems, enabling a seamless restoration of movement and function without invasive surgical interventions or externally conspicuous attachments.\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/708,209 filed on Feb. 20, 2007, which claims the benefit of commonly owned provisional patent application No. 60/774,758 filed Feb. 17, 2006. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention relates to stimulation of nerves to enhance and/or restore various body functions and/or to reduce pain. [0003] Traumatic destruction or disease of the upper motoneurones inevitably leads to loss of motoric function such as standing up/walking, prehension or urination (voiding of the bladder) or defecation (bowel movement), and also to sensitive disorders such as pain or sensation loss. These conditions are serious and potentially life threatening, and great effort has been expended aimed at restoration of complete autonomy to individuals afflicted with such conditions. [0004] Various types of neuroprothesis have been developed as a result, including muscular electrodes, neural electrodes and epidermal electrodes. The method of deployment of such electrodes has been problematic. One approach is transdermal, but this results in the need for large amounts of energy, as well as very precise placement and the inconvenience of always being connected to wires. [0005] Implantation of the electrodes is far preferable, but this poses a new set of issues, including the need for implanting the energy source for the electrode as well as the method for implanting and new problems created by the implantation. [0006] Based upon the foregoing, it is clear that the need exists for an improved method of stimulating nerves to enhance and/or restore various body functions. [0007] It is the primary object of the invention to provide such a method. [0008] It is a further object of the invention to provide this method in a manner which is safe and effective for the patient. [0009] Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear below. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] According to the invention, the foregoing objects and advantages have been attained. [0011] According to the invention, a method is provided for altering operation of a nerve related to a given body condition, comprising the steps of: identifying at least one nerve root related to the given body condition; laparoscopically implanting at least one electrode at the nerve root; and operating the electrode to electrostimulate the nerve root and alter operation of the nerve. [0012] This method can be used according to the invention to produce bladder function in a neurogenic bladder, to restore leg movement and the ability to stand up and walk, and to reduce pain. Other uses also fall within the broad scope of the present invention. [0013] According to the invention, specific nerves and nerve strands can be identified and acted upon by laparoscopically implanted electrodes to provide the desired function. This provides for safe access to the proper nerves, especially in the pelvic region, and allows for implantation of electrodes, with their power sources if necessary, in a location which is convenient, reliable and safe to the patient. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0014] A detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention follows, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein: [0015] FIG. 1 schematically illustrates components of a system according to the invention in one area of use; [0016] FIG. 2 schematically illustrates a system according to the invention in another area of use; [0017] FIG. 3 illustrates normal pelvic innervation as it relates to the bladder; [0018] FIG. 4 illustrates one option for stimulating nerves of the bladder; [0019] FIG. 5 illustrates another option for stimulating nerves of the bladder; and [0020] FIG. 6 illustrates still another option for stimulating nerves of the bladder. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0021] The invention relates to laparoscopic implantation of neuroelectrodes on laparoscopically identified nerves and/or nerve strands to allow stimulation of those nerves and/or modulation of signals carried by those nerves. Laparoscopic procedures are particularly effective at identifying nerves in the pelvic area and implanting electrodes at nerves in that area, and the present invention is useful, for example, for restoring normal bladder function, restoring function of the muscle groups which allow a person to stand and the like. In addition, laparoscopic implantation of electrodes can be used to modulate signals through or from certain nerves to mediate or block pain. [0022] Preferred embodiments of the invention are discussed below in connection with restoration of bladder function, restoration of function of the gluteal muscle group, restoration of sexual function, restoration of rectal function, spasticity of the lower extremities, modulation of pain signals, and concurrent nerve stimulation. [0023] In connection with one aspect of the invention, laparoscopically implanted electrodes are used to restore normal bladder function to a patient who has lost this function, a condition which is referred to herein as a neurogenic bladder. Normal function of the bladder involves contraction of the bladder muscle during voiding, and relaxation of the bladder muscle at other times. Further, the bladder sphincter normally relaxes, or at least does not contract, during voiding, and contracts at other times. These functions are controlled by the central nervous system, and conditions affecting the nervous system can interfere with proper bladder function. For example functional disorders occur in paraplegia patients who normally have a hyperactive bladder. The bladder in these cases is overactive during filling, and during voiding or urination, both the sphincter muscle and the bladder contract simultaneously. This creates a dangerous condition wherein excessive pressure creates risk of damage to the kidneys. [0024] According to the invention, electrodes are implanted at specific roots of the sacral nerve and/or pudendal nerve and are operated to produce desired bladder function. FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a system according to the invention implanted in a human abdomen for controlling bladder function. According to the invention, electrodes 10 are implanted in communication with specific roots of the sacral nerve 12. An external power source 14 is provided in this embodiment and communicated with electrode 10 through a receiver 16 , which is also implanted in the patient for receiving signals to operate electrodes 10. A controller 18 can be used to issue control signals and power signals through a transmitter 20 to communicate with receiver 16 and thereby operate electrode 10 as desired. It should be appreciated that the configuration as shown in FIG. 1 advantageously positions the electrode and related wiring and receiver within the pelvic area, which avoids problems associated with other configurations as described above. Similar to the FIG. 1 orientation for the sacral nerve, bladder function may also be controlled through the implantation of electrodes in the pelvic region in communication with roots of the pudendal nerve. It should be appreciated that external power source 14 could be a battery or any other readily available external source of power, and especially a source of a power signal which can be sent to an internal receiver, for example using radio frequency signals. [0025] It has been found that the bladder and bladder sphincter muscles are controlled by nerves which run through the sacral spinal nerve and/or the pudendal pelvic region nerve. Further, current laparoscopic technology allows the sacral nerve to be differentiated to identify different sacral roots, referred to as S1-S5. If there is any doubt as to identification of the sacral roots and/or pudendal roots, electrostimulation can be used to confirm identification. This identification is used in the present invention to allow stimulation of specific sacral roots and/or pudendal roots to restore or otherwise influence certain functions of the body. [0026] FIG. 3 schematically illustrates a bladder 22 , sphincter 24 and sacral nerve 12. All different sacral nerve roots also contain fibers for bladder contraction and for contraction of the sphincter of the bladder. The main fibers for the sphincter have been found in the sacral nerve root S2, while the main fibers for bladder and rectum contraction are found in the sacral nerve roots S3, S4 and S5. The aim is to produce an isolated contraction of the bladder without concomitant contraction of the sphincter. This is not feasible when electricity is applied on the entire sacral nerve roots together. According to the invention, three different options are provided for producing an elective contraction of bladder 22 without simultaneous contraction of sphincter 24 during electrostimulation. [0027] FIG. 4 illustrates one option in accordance with the invention, specifically, the elective stimulation of the pelvic parasympathetic nerves of the bladder and the rectum. FIG. 4 shows sacral nerve 12 separated into its different roots S1, S2, S3 and S4/5. In this approach, electrodes (schematically illustrated by wires 26 , 28 , 30 ) are attached to S2, S3 and S4/5. In order to selectively contract the bladder in this embodiment, selective stimulation can be directed to S3 and S4/5 to cause contraction of the bladder as desired. When it is no longer desired to have the contraction of the bladder, stimulation of S3 and S4/5 can be stopped during the filling phase of the bladder. During voiding of the bladder, the selective stimulation of S3 and S4/5 allows contraction of the bladder without contraction of the sphincter (which is mainly controlled through S2). Stimulation of the pudendal and/or sacral nerve allows for the effective control of bladder/rectum incontinence or overactivity. [0028] FIG. 5 illustrates a second option, similar to that illustrated in FIG. 4 , but wherein sacral nerve roots S3 and S4/5 are cut distally after emergence of the parasympathetic nerves which permit an elective stimulation of the detrusor by stimulation of the sacral nerve roots S3 and S4/5. This approach allows such stimulation without concomitant stimulation of the pudendal nerve, thus without contractions of the sphincter nor muscles of the lower limbs. Since the sacral nerve root S2, which contains the major fibers for the sphincter, is kept intact under this approach, elective stimulation of S3 and S4/5 without stimulation of S2 produces electrical induced micturition, without incontinence during the filling phase of the bladder. Further, since S3 and S4/5 are not critical in connection with the functions of standing up and locomotion, no substantial side effects occur due to the distal transaction or cutting of the S3 and S4/5 sacral roots. Thus, option 2 advantageously allows for the same elective stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves as set forth in the approach of FIG. 4 , but has the further advantage of avoiding unwanted contraction of the sphincter and/or muscles of the lower limbs during electrically induced micturition. [0029] Turning to FIG. 6 , a third option is provided and illustrated in accordance with the present invention. In this option, stimulation of nerve roots S3 and S4/5 can be implemented when desired for micturition, along with a simultaneous stimulation of a blocking signal of the pudendal nerve. By blocking signals through the pudendal nerve, the same result of the option illustrated in FIG. 5 can be accomplished, without the need for cutting the sacral nerve roots. In addition in a similar manner as described above for the sacral nerve, the bladder and rectum may be controlled through stimulation of the pudendal nerve. [0030] As will be discussed further below, it is an aspect of the invention to use electrodes to issue a modulating signal to certain nerve roots. In this embodiment, an electrode can be used to modulate or neutralize signals carried by the pudendal nerve and, thereby, accomplish the same result as is accomplished in the embodiment of FIG. 4 , but without having to cut S3 and S4/5. [0031] It should of course be appreciated that in each of the above-described approaches, electrodes communicated directly with specific sacral nerve roots and/or pudendal nerve roots are used advantageously to electrically induce the proper conditions for micturition, specifically, an elective contraction of the bladder without simultaneous contraction of the sphincter. [0032] Thus, according to the invention, laparoscopic differentiation of the sacral nerve roots S2, S3, S4/5, and/or pudendal nerve roots along with elective implantation of electrodes on each sacral nerve root and/or pudendal nerve root, and further with optional selective distal transection of the sacral nerve root and/or pudendal nerve root containing parasympathetic fibers for the detrusor or bladder muscle wall and for the rectum, allows different kinds of bladder voiding to be obtained. Specifically, this includes a per-stimulus micturition by elective isolated stimulation of the pudendal nerve roots and/or sacral nerve roots S3 and S4/5 on both sides of the body. [0033] In situations where a per-stimulus micturition is unable to completely void the bladder, a concomitant stimulation of all sacral nerve roots S2-S4/5 could be able to produce a post-stimulus micturition as in the classic Brindley bladder, or isolated stimulation of S2 could be enough for opening the sphincter followed by a continuous stimulation of S3 and S4/5 for full emptying of the bladder by a continuous stream. [0034] Stimulation according to the invention may be neurogenic or non-neurogenic. For example, any cell of the body may be stimulated. Bladder stimulation may also be myogenic. The stimulation of the bladder cells could also be used to control the bladder. Bladder cell stimulation to control myogenic bladder muscle tone, i.e. hypo-/atonia, is also readily accomplished according to this invention. [0035] Laparoscopic implantation of an electrode for neuromodulation (quadripolar electrode) on the pudendal nerve root and/or sacral nerve roots S2 to S4/5 could be an alternative to the \u201csurgical deafferentation\u201d discussed above which induces sexual troubles, such as the loss of ejaculation, ejaculation precox and loss of erection in paralyzed patients. Pudendal nerve root and/or sacral nerve root stimulation could also be an alternative to sexual troubles in woman, such as anorgasmy, i.e. inability to orgasm. For example, a single multi-pole electrode can be attached functionally separately to each of S2-S4/5 of the sacral nerve and optionally also to S1. This electrode can be used to modulate any combination of S2-S4/5 which is necessary in order to prevent contraction of the bladder during filling. During voiding or micturition, specific poles of the electrode can be operated to induce the desired actions of the bladder and sphincter as described herein. [0036] The electrodes, after implanting, must be powered and also controlled to emit the desired signal or stimulus to the nerve. According to the invention, the power source for the electrode can be external, or can be implanted along with the electrode, preferably as a single structure. [0037] If the application of the device concerns neuromodulation (e.g. pain therapy), only low voltages are necessary for the electrode, and low energy consumption occurs. Typical parameters include 8-10 Volts, about 25 Hz, and 250 microsecond pulses. For such an application, a battery (e.g. pacemaker battery, type Itrel 3, supplier Medtronic) is implanted along with the electrodes. [0038] In the case of re-establishment of body functions, e.g. motions of paralyzed patients, higher voltages (20-30V, 30 Hz) are required which would be problematic for implanted batteries. Here, electrical energy is transmitted from the external via radio frequency signals, for example from transmitter 20 to receiver 16. Further, in this embodiment, a battery would not be necessary since the stimulation would not be permanent\u2014as in the case of pain therapy\u2014but instead energy is applied only when needed, e.g. for emptying the bladder. [0039] A receiver is also provided, and preferably implanted in the patient to receive control signals which can be generated by the patient or caregiver, for example using some form of control unit. The receiver is operatively communicated with the electrodes to provide signals to the electrodes as desired. [0040] According to the invention, wiring between the electrodes and/or power source or receiver can be safely passed through the pelvic region, also using laparoscopic techniques, which are much more user friendly than other surgically installed electrodes and/or wiring. [0041] According to another aspect of the invention, laparoscopic implantation of electrodes can be used to restore pelvic or leg functions. In one aspect of the invention, electrodes are implanted to restore the functions of standing up and walking. Before a paralyzed patient can walk, he must be able to stand up and remain standing. The most important muscle activity is the contraction of the buttock muscle. In order to stimulate such muscles, placement of electrodes in a friction, pressure or sitting area must be avoided. Incisions in the buttock region are also unacceptable. [0042] Placement of electrodes laparoscopically according to the invention, on the muscle nerves themselves, leads to a homogenous contraction of the whole muscle as desired. The location of the electrodes should not be affected by movement, pressure or friction, and the location must be such that all muscles required for a particular motion are included. [0043] Stimulation of the gluteal musculature is necessary for the patient to be able to stand up and this presents the main problem. Operative access for placement of the electrodes on the Nervus glutealis superior and inferior is required. This is an extremely short nerve, and it divides directly at the opening of the foramen ischiadicus magnus into numerous branches. According to the invention, suitable electrodes are placed directly on the development point of these nerves out of the plexus sacralis, in the pelvis. Transperitoneal placement of electrodes through laparoscopy enables optimal placement of the electrodes in the pelvis where all the stimulation possibilities necessary for standing up and walking can be recorded and/or produced with only a small amount of effort. For paralyzed patients, anesthetic is not generally even needed since the lower extremity regions are no longer sensitive. [0044] Electrodes for controlling the gluteal musculature are preferably placed on one or more of the nerves discussed below. An intrafascicular neurolysis is performed on the Nervus femoral, which is a nerve with mixed functions, as only the motoric fibers should be stimulated. The motoric fascicule is differentiated from the sensitive fasciculation with the aid of neurostimulation. The nerves identified for treatment with electrodes include the Nervi Glutei inferior and superior, the musculus iliopsoas nerve, and the plantar flexion nerve. [0045] An interfasciculator neurolysis is also performed and the fibers of the Nervus peroneus are isolated with the aid of neurostimulation. Placement of electrodes is performed on both sides of the body."

  "negative": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to surgical devices, particularly focused on advancements in hub and handle structures for endoscopic equipment. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART XYZ Surgical Enterprises has introduced a medical device for endoscopic procedures following patents by Doe et al., including advanced optical features for enhanced tissue visualization. The device includes an ergonomic handle, a flexible insertion shaft, an integrated visual interface, and an extendable manipulation tool. The handle aligns with the shaft, allowing surgeons to adjust the angular orientation to facilitate various surgical tasks. The optical interface connects to an external monitor for real-time imaging, while the manipulation tool can be extended and retracted through the shaft for tissue interaction. The device is used for minimally invasive surgeries requiring precision and has found applications in abdominal and thoracic procedures. In use, a small incision is made, and, utilizing the visual assistance from the system, the surgeon navigates the device to the target area. The operational end of the device then extends the manipulation tool to interact with internal tissues under visual guidance. The importance of a stable connection between the handle and shaft has been appreciated in the field, leading to innovations that prevent accidental disengagement during surgery. The current device employs a twist-and-lock mechanism on the handle's base that secures the connection with the insertion shaft, simplified by tactile feedback features. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The main objective of this invention is to enhance the structural connection between the handle and the insertion shaft of an endoscopic surgical device. The invention introduces a dual-groove fixture at the base of the insertion shaft, which mates with a complementary lock inside the handle. This design ensures a stable fit with easy assembly. As the insertion shaft is aligned and inserted into the handle, a rotational motion engages the lock, securing the shaft at the desired orientation. A locking button, which can be a thumb press or slider, is then engaged to solidify the connection, preventing accidental detachment and providing increased safety during surgical procedures. The handle's internal mechanism features a spring-biased locking pin that engages with notches in the insertion shaft, allowing for multiple fixed angular positions, suited to surgical requirements. The handle is constructed from a high-strength polymer, balancing durability with a lightweight profile, while the insertion shaft is typically fashioned from stainless steel for its robustness and biocompatibility. DRAWINGS FIGS. 1A-1D illustrate various views of a dual notched locking hub design for an insertion shaft; FIGS. 2A-2D depict different perspectives of a rotational locking hub design for an insertion shaft; FIGS. 3A-3D present various views of a multi-positional locking hub design for an insertion shaft; FIGS. 4A-4D show the insertion shaft being coupled to handles with different locking mechanisms; FIGS. 5A-5D demonstrate locked states of the insertion shaft and handle combinations with cut away illustrations; FIG. 6 is a schematic representation of a handle bore featuring dual internal locking lands; FIG. 7 illustrates a retractable manipulation tool and visual system placed within an insertion shaft. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIGS. 1A-1D and 2A-2D show insertion shaft designs with secure locking at either left or right-hand orientations. FIGS. 3A-3D introduce a variation where the shaft locks in multiple angular positions. The significant difference among these designs lies in the proximal end of the shaft. The insertion shaft is typically disposable, intended to be attached to a handle unit. It features a closed distal end for ease of insertion and navigation within body cavities. The proximal end is configured to interface with the handle's bore, utilizing a dual-groove design for alignment and locking. Upon insertion and rotation, distinct locking mechanisms within the handle secure the shaft in place, preventing rotational or axial movement during use. Variants of locking mechanisms include button actuators and sliders, positioned for ergonomic access. In certain designs, the proximal end of the insertion shaft may feature depressions, corresponding to multiple fixed angular positions, enhancing operational versatility. The provided figures clearly depict the configurations and operation of different locking mechanisms and their engagement with the insertion shaft designs.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to surgical instruments used for carpal tunnel release, and is particularly directed to an improved hub and handle design. 2. Background Description MicroAire Surgical Instruments has been marketing for a number of years a surgical tool based on U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,770 to Agee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,147 to Agee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,000 to Agee et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,284 to Agee et al, each of which is incorporated fully herein by reference. This surgical tool is used to inspect and manipulate selected tissue in a body cavity, and has particular application to performing safe and effective carpal tunnel release. These tools include a handle assembly, a probe member, an optical system, and a cutting system. The optical system and cutting system extend through the handle and into the probe and permit a surgical blade to be selectively deployed and retracted from a lateral opening in the top surface of the probe at its distal end. The preferred use of the surgical instrument in performing carpal tunnel release is accomplished by forming a short transverse incision located proximal to the carpal tunnel and the wrist flexion crease. After longitudinal spreading dissection, to avoid injury to the sensory nerves, the incision is continued through the deep fascia of the forearm, the distal extension of which leads to the flexor retinaculum. After an incision through the finger flexor synovium, extension of the wrist will then expose the proximal opening of the carpal tunnel, thereby forming a passage to the carpal tunnel. The rotational orientation of the probe relative to the handle or holder is adjustable to suit the needs of the surgeon. After adjusting the rotational orientation of the probe, the probe is inserted through the incision and desirably through the length of the carpal tunnel to the distal edge of the flexor retinaculum. By employing the optical system, and through manipulation of the patient&#39;s extremities, the anatomy within the carpal tunnel can be clearly visualized on a display of a video monitor connected to a video camera and lighting source associated with the optical system. The distal end of probe will desirably have gently displaced the tendons, bursa and median nerve found within the carpal tunnel to facilitate insertion of the probe. Then the lateral aperture of the probe will be positioned adjacent the medial surface of the flexor retinaculum and, desirably, the configuration of the probe upper surface (which is preferably a flat surface) will exclude the displaced tissues from the region surrounding the lateral aperture. Markers can be used to indicate the point on the probe where the blade elevates, and help facilitate proper placement of the probe relative to the distal edge of the flexor retinaculum. At the appropriate location, a cutting blade will be extended to contact the distal edge of the flexor retinaculum, while the surgeon views the tissue to be divided via the display. The blade point will desirably be extended to a position sufficient to completely release the ligament. While viewing (through the lateral aperture in the probe) the intended path of the extended cutting blade, the probe is then withdrawn, thereby dividing the flexor retinaculum and releasing the carpal tunnel. The surgical tool described by Agee et al. is safe and effective and well regarded in the surgical community. Improvements to the mechanism for securely fastening the probe to the handle and for orienting the lateral opening of the probe to either side of the handle will be well regarded within the community. Currently, the tool includes a spring loaded knob and locking member which cooperates with an annular groove in the probe end. To align the probe to one side or another, the surgeon must align indicia or a rib member on the probe with indicia on the handle and screw the knob a sufficient amount to tighten the locking member against the probe SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved hub and handle design for a surgical instrument, such as a carpal tunnel release tool described above in conjunction with the Agee et al. patents (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,926,770, 4,963,147, 5,089,000, and 5,306,284, each of which are herein incorporated by reference). According to the invention, the proximal end of a probe is provided with a pair of axial grooves that lead to a slotted twist region, and the handle includes a bore with inwardly projecting land regions sized to fit within the axial grooves and the slotted twist region. This allows the probe to slide within the bore, and then be twisted to its proper orientation. The pair of axial grooves on the probe end also serve the function of interacting with a locking member actuated by a button, slider, or similar device on the handle surface. Once the probe is twisted to the left or the right side of the handle, the locking member will be moved into position in at least one of the axial slots preferably under the influence of a spring bias. This prevents the probe from rotating accidentally during use. In addition, the slotted twist region and inwardly projecting lands of the bore prevent the probe from being removed from the handle accidentally during use. In a variation on the design, the locking member can cooperate with a series of depressions formed in the proximal end of the probe so that the probe can be oriented at a number of discrete angles. The slotted twist region can take a number of different forms including an annular groove in the circumference of the proximal end of the probe, or a pair of slotted pathways that accommodate a partial twist, such as a quarter twist, of the probe (it being understood that the slotted pathways could be sized for different amounts of twisting depending on the tool design). A variety of locking mechanisms can be used including, for example, pushbuttons at the top and front of the handle, or sliders at the top of the handle (it being recognized that the actuators can be positioned at a number of different locations on the handle, and can take a number of different forms). Preferably, the probe is disposable and made of a durable plastic material; however different materials such as composites, glass and metal can be used. Furthermore, to lighten the instrument, it is preferable that the handle be made of a rugged plastic material. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing and other objects, aspects and advantages will be better understood from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention with reference to the drawings, in which: FIGS. 1A-1D are isometric, top, side, and end views of a two position screw lock hub design for a probe; FIGS. 2A-2D are isometric, top, side and end views of a two position twist lock hub design for a probe; FIGS. 3A-3D are isometric, top, side and end views of an adjustable position twist lock hub design for a probe; FIGS. 4A-4D are isometric views of probe and handle combinations where FIG. 4A shows the probe of FIG. 1A being inserted into a handle with a button release, FIG. 4B shows the probe of FIG. 1A being inserted into a handle with a slide release, FIG. 4C shows the probe of FIG. 2A being inserted into a handle with a top button release, and FIG. 4D shows the probe of FIG. 3A being inserted into a handle with a top button release; FIGS. 5A-5D are cut away illustrations of the probe and handle combinations of FIGS. 4A-4D where the probe has been inserted into the handle, twisted so that the upper face of the probe is oriented to one side of the handle, and locked in place using a locking mechanism that includes an actuator on the handle; FIG. 6 is a schematic drawing of a bore hole with two inwardly projecting land regions; and FIG. 7 shows an example of a retractable cutting blade and optical system positioned within a probe. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIGS. 1A-1D and 2 A- 2 D show probe designs where the probe can be selectively locked in a position that is oriented towards the left or right side of a surgical tool handle. FIGS. 3A-3D show a variation on the design shown in FIGS. 2A-2D where the probe can be locked in additional positions to the right and left side orientation. In each of these Figures, like elements use the same numbers. The probe designs primarily differ at the proximal end, as will be discussed in more detail below. The probe 10 is preferably a disposable item that is attachable to a handle device and its proximal end 12. Its distal end 14 can be inserted into a body cavity, and particularly into incision sites used when performing carpal tunnel release. The probe 10 preferably has a flat top surface that has a lateral opening 16 near the distal end. The lateral opening 16 allows for a cutting blade (not shown) located inside the probe 10 to be selectively deployed to performing cutting at locations selected by the surgeon. After cutting, the cutting blade is fully retractable within the lateral opening. Cutting is performed using an optical system (not shown) that passes through the probe 10 from an opening 18 in its proximal end 12 to the lateral opening 16. The optical system may include optical fibers, optical waveguides, or a series or lenses or other suitable components. Preferably the optical system includes a camera, a display, and other components which allow the surgeon to view the tissue located at the lateral opening 16 using a remotely positioned display device. This enables a surgeon to make cuts at precise locations where tissue manipulation would provide benefit to the patient. From the top view ( FIGS. 1B , 2 B, and 3 B) it can be seen that a rib 20 can be provided which preferably precisely aligns with the path taken by the cutting blade when it is deployed from the lateral opening 16. While not shown in the figures, markings or other indicia can be advantageously positioned on the top surface of the probe 10 to assist the surgeon in placing the probe in the proper location. While the embodiments shown herein have a single lateral opening 16 in the top surface near the distal end of the probe 10 , it should be understood that more than one opening could be provided (e.g., there could be separate openings for the optical system and the blade). From the side view ( FIGS. 1C , 2 C, and 3 C) it can be seen that the distal end of the probe 10 is closed 22 and preferably has a curved shape. This allows the end of the probe 22 to gently displace the tendons, bursa and median nerve found within the carpal tunnel, thus facilitating insertion of the probe. Pivot pin 24 is shown on the side of the probe 10. The blade is preferably deployed and retracted using a tool extension shaft (not shown) that passes through the probe 10 and cooperates with a pivot pin 24 for pivoting the blade open and closed. From the end view ( FIGS. 1D , 2 D, and 3 D) it can be seen that the proximal end 12 has two axial slots 24 on opposite sides. These slots 24 serve the dual function of guiding the proximal end 12 of the probe 10 into a bore of surgical tool handle and interacting with a locking mechanism, as is discussed in detail below. FIG. 6 schematically shows that the bore 25 of the handle includes inwardly projecting land regions 26. To install the probe on the handle or to remove the probe from the handle, the two axial slots 24 must be aligned with the inwardly projecting land regions 26. FIGS. 1A-1C show an embodiment of the probe where there are two slotted pathways 28 in the form of a threaded screw partial twist in a slotted twist region 30 of the proximal end 12 of the probe. The two slotted pathways 28 begin just after the two axial slots 24 and are connected therewith. The inwardly projecting lands 26 of the bore 25 ( FIG. 6 ) fit within the two slotted pathways 28 and permit a partial twist similar to a threaded screw. While FIGS. 1A-1C show a \u00bc turn twist, it should be understood that pathways of different length and turn radius can be used. The \u00bc twist has the advantage of being able to turn the lateral opening 16 of the probe 10 such that it is either facing in the direction of the left side or the right side of the handle. In contrast, the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2A-2C and 3 A- 3 C show that the slots 24 lead to an annular groove 32 which spans the circumference of the proximal end 12 of the probe 10 at the slotted twist region 30. Similar to the description above for FIGS. 1A-1C , once the inwardly projecting lands 26 of the bore 25 pass through the slots 24 of the probes 10 depicted in FIGS. 2A-2C and 3 A- 3 C, they enter the annular groove 32 , thus enabling the probe 10 to be twisted to the left or right. FIGS. 3A-3D also show the inclusion of a series of depressions 34 in the proximal end 12 of the probe 10. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3A-3D , a locking member (discussed below) will be able to extend into each of the depressions 34 , as well as each of the slots 24 to lock the probe 10 to a handle of a surgical tool. Also, by contrasting FIGS. 2A-2D with FIGS. 3A-3D , it can be seen that the location of the slots 24 can vary depending on the design choice of the manufacturer. That is, the slots 24 can be oriented to the sides of the top surface of the probe 10 ( FIGS. 2A-2D ) or in alignment with the top and bottom surface of the probe ( FIGS. 3A-3D ) or at any other orientation desired. FIGS. 4A-4D respectively show probes being inserted into a different handles, and FIGS. 5A-5D show cut away illustrations with probe inserted into and locked to the handle using different locking mechanisms. With reference to FIG. 4A , a probe 10 is inserted into the bore 25 of a handle 34 which has an actuator 36 , in the form of a button, on its front surface. With reference to FIG. 5A , the actuator 36 is spring 38 biased and includes a locking pawl or member 40 which fits within either one of the two slots 24 (best shown in FIGS. 1A , 1 C, and 1 D) at the proximal end 12 of the probe. In operation, the actuator 36 is depressed and the probe 10 has its proximal end slid into the bore 25. Once the lands 26 have cleared the two axial slots 24 , the probe is twisted to have the lateral opening on its top surface face in the direction of either the left side or right side of the handle 34 (note that the lateral opening faces into the paper in FIG. 5A ). Then, the actuator is released to cause the locking pawl or member 40 to slide into one of the two axial slots 24. This firmly secures the probe 10 to the handle 34 as the locking pawl or member 40 prevents rotation of the probe 10 within bore 25 of the handle, and the lands 26 within the slotted twist region 30 prevent axial movement of the probe 10 out of the bore 25 in the handle 34. The optical system can be inserted through the housing and into the probe 10 after its installation on the handle 34 , and the tool extension shaft can be connected (it being understood that connection of these elements can occur also occur before or during the insertion and twisting of the probe 10 ). Removal of the probe 10 from the handle 10 occurs in the reverse order by beginning with depressing of the button actuator 36. An advantage of the design shown in FIGS. 4A and 5A is that the opening can be securely locked in an orientation facing in the same direction as the left or right side of the handle 34 without requiring the surgeon to line up the rib with indicia on the handle. Further, the design allows locking of the probe in place simply by releasing a button actuator and without having to twist a knob for tightening a screw to a point where unintentional rotation of the probe is avoided. The configuration shown in FIGS. 4B and 5B is similar to that shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. However, the configuration shown in FIGS. 4B and 5B shows a spring biased slider 42 on the top of the handle 34. The slider 42 could be positioned almost anywhere on the handle. The key feature is that the slider has a locking pawl or member 44 which slides into one of the two axial slots 24 at the proximal end 12 of the probe 10. With the slider 42 arrangement, the spring biasing might not be used. If not, the surgeon would be required to slide the slider into a position where the locking pawl or member 44 fits in an axial slot 24 at the proximal end 12 of the probe 10 when it is desired to secure the probe 10. Attachment and removal of the probe is achieved in the same manner discussed above with respect to FIGS. 4A and 5A. The configuration shown in FIGS."

  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATIONS The present invention was first described in a notarized Official Record of Invention on Sep. 17, 2009, that is on file at the offices of Montgomery Patent and Design, LLC, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to display cases and frames, and in particular, to a customizable display case for collectibles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A great many people enjoy collecting various items and objects. Such collectibles are not only limited to stamps and coins but also include other items, such as toys, die-cast metal cars, action figures, trading cards, or comic books. These items provide a sense of nostalgia for many people. To many others, these collectibles represent an investment as those that are in pristine condition and still in their retail packaging command the highest dollar. Accordingly, there is a strong desire to protect the value of such collectibles. However, this desire to protect is often offset by the need to view and enjoy the item. Various picture frames, poster frames, shadow boxes, or similar multi-purpose cases exist for many different types of items. Typically these frames provide a structural frame and a flat transparent viewing window on only a front side. These features are well suited for flat or substantially flat items or collectibles, particularly those where only a front side of the item is ever displayed. However, many toys or other collectibles have various thicknesses and come in plastic and cardboard packaging, such as blister packaging, where frames or shadow boxes do not provide a suitable display. Additionally, many of these collectible items have images and information printed on the back side of the packaging which the owner may want to displayed as much as the front side. Those cases available to display these types of collectibles typically require the owner to use an adhesive or otherwise damage the packaging in order to position and retain the item in an upright position for display. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and lack in the art and observed that there is a need for a device and method by which collectible items can be displayed for enjoyment yet protected against harm and physical damage. It is an object of the present disclosure to solve these problems. The inventor recognized these problems and has addressed this need by developing of a collectibles display case which provides a way to simply and conveniently display collectible items in a manner which also protects the item from damage, wear, or potential loss in value. The inventor has thus realized the advantages and benefits of providing a frame for enclosing a displayable collectible. The frame includes an upper horizontal segment, a pair of opposing vertical segments, a lower horizontal segment opposite the upper horizontal segment, and a frame fastening member removably connected to the lower horizontal segment. A transparent front window is mounted within the frame for viewing a front side of the collectible. A placeholder is mounted within the frame behind the front window for retaining and supporting the collectible. A transparent rear window is mounted within the frame behind the placeholder for viewing a back side of the collectible. A first groove is inset on an interior surface of the upper horizontal segment, the pair of vertical segments and the lower horizontal segment at a forward position for receiving the front window. A second groove is inset on the interior surface of the upper horizontal segment, the pair of vertical segments and the frame fastening member at an intermediate position for slidably receiving the placeholder. A third groove is inset on the interior surface of the upper horizontal segment, the pair of vertical segments and the frame fastening member at a rearward position for slidably receiving the rear window. The placeholder includes a first mat having a customizable first mat opening which is substantially equivalent to a peripheral edge of the collectible and a second mat having a customizable second mat opening that is smaller than said first mat opening. The first mat and the second mat are connected and an offset area of the second mat between the first mat opening and the second mat opening provides a contact surface for a perimeter portion of the collectible. The frame has a thickness such that the distance between the first groove and the second groove is sufficient to enclose the body of collectible between the front window and the placeholder. The body of the collectible protrudes through the second mat opening. Furthermore, the described features and advantages of the disclosure may be combined in various manners and embodiments as one skilled in the relevant art will recognize. The disclosure can be practiced without one (1) or more of the features and advantages described in a particular embodiment. Further advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.

However, the disclosure is not limited to a single described embodiment and a person skilled in the art will appreciate that many other embodiments are possible without deviating from the basic concept of the disclosure and that any such work around will also fall under its scope. It is envisioned that other styles and configurations can be easily incorporated into the teachings of the present disclosure, and only one particular configuration may be shown and described for purposes of clarity and disclosure and not by way of limitation of scope. The terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d herein do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced items. The present invention describes a collectibles display case (herein described as an \u201capparatus\u201d) 10 , which provides a structure for and method of storing and displaying packaged collectibles 15 such as, but not limited to: die-cast metal cars, action figures, playing cards, and the like in a viewable structure which enables the collectible 15 to remain in a pristine condition. Referring now to FIG. 1 , an environmental view of the apparatus 10 and FIG. 2 , an exploded front perspective view of the apparatus 10 , are disclosed. The apparatus 10 generally includes a frame 20 , a front window 30 , a first mat 41 , a second mat 42 , an overlay 50 , and a back window 60. The apparatus 10 is customizable for a various types and styles of collectible 15 which are displayed within. The collectibles 15 are envisioned to include, but are not limited to: action figures, die cast cars, various types of trading cards, comics books, or similar collectible articles. The frame 20 provides a support structure to surround, secure, and protect the collectible 15 , particularly for collectibles 15 which remain in an unopened condition within the original packaging, such as a blister pack. The frame 20 includes exterior housing having an upper horizontal segment 27 and an opposing lower horizontal segment 29 and a pair of opposing vertical segments 28 which combine to form a generally square or rectangular structure and are preferably combined as a single structure similar to a shadow box. The frame 20 is fabricated from materials such as, but not limited to, plastic, wood, or the like. The mats 41 , 42 , and overlay 45 are preferably made of a thin foam, cardboard, or cardstock material, yet other materials may be utilized without limiting the scope of the apparatus 10. The windows 30 , 60 are preferably fabricated from transparent materials such as, but not limited to: glass, acrylic glass, or the like. All components of the apparatus 10 can be made in various dimensions to facilitate various sized collectibles 15. Referring now to FIG. 3 a front view of a combined first mat 41 and second mat 42 ; FIG. 4 is a partially exploded front perspective view of the combined first mat 41 and second mat 42 depicted with a collectible 15 being applied; and, FIG. 5 is a partially exploded front perspective view of the combined first mat 41 and second mat 42 with the collectible 15 applied and an overlay 50 being applied, are disclosed. The apparatus 10 includes a placeholder 40 for retaining the collectable 15 in a displayable orientation. The placeholder 40 includes a combination of the first mat 41 and the second mat 42. The first mat 41 , the second mat 42 , and an overlay 50 provide vertical support and a decorative border around the collectible 15 and provide an aesthetic contrast between the collectible 15 and frame 20. Each of the mats 41 , 42 are customizable in size, color, and thickness by the end user based upon the type of collectible 15 applied to the apparatus 10. The first mat 41 and second mat 42 are also customized by including a first mat opening 43 and second mat opening 44 , respectively, which are can be cut to size by the user or can be provided pre-cut for particular styles of collectible packaging. In use, the collectible 15 is centered upon the first mat 41 and the outer perimeter of the collectible 15 is outlined with writing utensil or similar marking instrument so the user can cut out the outline using a blade or scissors to create the first mat opening 43. The first opening 41 is approximately equivalent to an exterior perimeter of the packaging of the collectible 15 and provides an aperture for the collectible 15 to be inserted and allows the first mat 41 to form an exterior border around the collectible 15. The first mat 41 is then placed upon the second mat 42 and the first mat opening 43 is traced onto the second mat 42. The traced line is then offset inwardly and cut-out to form a second mat opening 44. The second mat opening 44 is preferably cut with an offset area 45 at least one-eighth (\u215b) of an inch away from the border of the first mat opening 43. The offset area 45 of the second mat 42 between the first mat opening 43 and the second mat opening 44 provides a rear support surface for the backside of the packaging of the collectible 15 to rest upon. The first mat 41 is mounted to the second mat 42 after a first mat opening 43 and a second mat opening 44 are created in each respective mat 41 , 42 which corresponds to the approximate width and length of the collectible 15 or the collectible packaging. The second mat 42 is preferably adhered to a rear surface of the first mat 41 such that the first mat opening 43 is aligned with the second mat opening 44 so the offset area 45 of second mat 42 provides secures the collectible 15 in a fixed vertical position. Once the first mat 41 and the second mat 42 are combined with the correct size to fit a particular size and type of collectible 15 , the mats 41 , 42 and frame 20 create a secure structure to retain the collectible 15 in an upright orientation for display purposes. The overlay 50 is positioned in front of the first mat 41 and provides a color contrast and further overall aesthetic appearance to the apparatus 10. The overlay 50 provides an approximately two (2) inch border around the outside of the collectible packaging and is positioned in front of the first mat 41 to provide a clean and neat appearance to the apparatus 10 and the collectible 15. The overlay 50 includes an overlay opening 51 which allows the collectible 15 and corresponding original packaging to be completely shown through. The collectible 15 shown as used with the apparatus 10 is depicted as a collectible action figure still within its original packaging. The apparatus 10 is designed to be used with various types of packaging including cardboard backed or clamshell type blister packs. However, it can be appreciated that various other packaged collectibles such as toys, models, trading cards, or comic books can be mounted and displayed in a similar fashion. The first mat opening 43 and second mat opening 44 will vary depending upon the type of collectible 15. Additionally, the length and thickness of the horizontal segments 27 and vertical segments 28 of the frame 20 will also vary with the type, size, and overall dimensions of the collectible 15 , as will be described in further detail. Referring now to FIG. 6 , a perspective view of the frame 20 depicting the lower horizontal segment 29 removed, is disclosed. The pair of horizontal segments 27 and the pair of vertical segments 28 provide the exterior structure to the frame 20. A lower horizontal segment 27 is removed for illustration purposes only and it can be appreciated that the two pairs of segments 27 , 28 would be integrally molded or otherwise connected to form a solid, unitary structure. The inner surfaces of each segment 27 , 28 include a first groove 21 , a second groove 22 , and a groove 23 which each provide a recessed area for the front window 30 ; the combination of the first mat 41 , second mat 42 , overlay 50 , and collectible 15 ; and the rear window 60 to be inserted and secured, respectively. The first groove 21 is located on a forward end portion of each segment 27 , 28 and provides a space for the placement of the front window 30. The second groove 22 is located on an intermediate portion of each segment 27 , 28 and provides a space for the first mats 41 , the combined second mat 42 , the applied collectible 15 , and the overlay 50. The third groove 23 is located on a rearward end portion, adjacent to the second groove 22 and provides a space for the rear window 60. The depth between the first groove 21 and second groove 22 may vary depending upon the size of the frame 20 and the dimensions of the collectible 15 , such that the entire packaging is enclosed between the opposing front window 30 and rear window 60. The front window 30 and the rear window 60 allow the collectible 15 to be viewed from the front or the rear when displayed within the apparatus 10. The front window 30 is positioned within the first groove 21 of the frame 20 and can be permanently affixed within the first groove 21 during fabrication processes.

  "query": "What are the key design features of a medical fluid filtration system intended for use in surgical environments?,",
  "negative": "The filtration unit consists of an integrated enclosure containing a vapor condensation zone with a predefined volume. It comprises a filter medium section and a filter element located within the filter medium section. The condensation zone includes a vapor outlet positioned to facilitate the transition of vapor to the filter medium section and is designed to prevent liquid passage while enabling vapor flow. An intake port situated on the enclosure allows for the ingress of gaseous mixtures from a procedural space, and an exhaust port allows for the expulsion of filtered gases. The vapor outlet is strategically placed near the midpoint of the condensation zone's volume, and it is elevated from the lowest potential position within the condensation zone regardless of the device's orientation in a gravitational field. It is also spaced from the zone's interior wall, centered within the condensation zone. The filter medium is specially designed for the absorption of aerosolized particles. The unit may also include a mechanical actuator and a fan to aid in the movement of gases through the system. This unit employs rotational motion to leverage centrifugal force for liquid-vapor separation. Another aspect involves a condensation device with a gas inlet and a gas outlet, bordered by a hollow vapor condensation chamber characterized by: an external periphery, a condensation chamber intake in direct communication with the gas inlet, and a condensation chamber exhaust in direct communication with the gas outlet; with the condensation chamber exhaust placed distanced from the external boundary towards a substantially central area of the condensation chamber. This hypothetical device may utilize a filter medium section situated between the condensation chamber exhaust and the gas outlet with a filter element placed within it. The filter medium might be constructed in a folded fashion and optimized for aerosolized particle absorption. Additional elements can include a valve, potentially of the sliding variety, a moisture-attracting fiber, an adhesive gel, a connection clip, and/or a hanging loop. The vapor condensation chamber can be constructed from a clear material, and the filter element may be imbued with antibacterial properties. The device may incorporate a propelling mechanism such as a pump, a fan, or a turbine. Another version may feature a liquid discharge port and a storage container for collected liquids. A humidity indicator signaling saturation of the filter medium may be included. The shape of the vapor condensation chamber could be cylindrical or cubic. The unit may have a blockage between the gas inlet and outlet and might use a water-repellent medium across the vapor trap exhaust. The apparatus can exploit a tangential force generated by fluid movement for separation purposes. The device may incorporate biodegradable content, be of sterile construction, and fitted for integration with wall-mounted suction mechanisms. It may also come equipped with an energy source, such as a battery. The item could include filter media with separate sections\u2014one of which may be pleated to optimize surface area, or fashioned as a sleeve, tailored to minimize odors, attract or transform harmful substances, possess antibacterial characteristics, or be hydrophilic or hydrophobic to prevent smoke passage. The filter media may incorporate activated carbon, comprise fibrous materials, or include an ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filter. The ingress might feature a tubing system made from a transparent substance to detect obstructions and be flexible enough to block flow if compressed with a clinch valve. An input coupler and a connection link with the exterior shell may be part of the design, potentially using Luer-Lock connectors or incorporating friction serrations or helical grooves. The internal wick could be hydrophobic or a liquid-retaining material such as sodium polyacrylate, fine-tuned to avoid substantial pressure drop at certain flow rates and block harmful material from degrading the filter element. The system may employ various valve types, which can be ergonomically improved with friction serrations. Additionally, for laparoscopic surgery, it can be designed to maintain abdominal inflation when operational. The inlet and outlet of the vapor trap can be aligned to prevent direct fluid flow, with the input path designed to face a wall of the vapor condensation chamber. The unit can have an output adapter for hose attachment, also potentially using a Luer-Lock connector or having friction serrations or helical grooves. A securing clip may present an elastic component, serrations for added grip, or may be designed for attachment to a surgical drape. A hanging loop might be designed for clipping or attachment to a carabiner, which could be a carabiner itself or involve Velcro brand straps. The shell and other components may be fabricated from a material that is lightweight, strong, antibacterial, biodegradable, or impermeable to radiation, such as a plastic, polymer, polyethylene, lead, or equivalent materials. Additionally, to enable fluid level visibility or detect flow obstructions, the material could be transparent. The shell may be sealed to create airtight connections, possibly through ultrasonic welding techniques. The filter system might be tuned for intake from a pressurized surgical room and output to the ambient atmosphere or configured to attach to suction units or standard hospital wall suction. It could include a balloon or bag to collect fluids passing through, incorporate an RFID tag, embed electronic data storage with filter specifications, or have an indicator for displaying utilization levels. Moreover, the design may include a one-way valve optimized to prevent materials trapped by the filter media from exiting back through the system input or pressure valves fitted at each port, set to prevent content from leaving the system without significant applied pressure. The valves could be adjusted to block any fluid movement through the system, even if attached to a pressurized surgical location, absent a pressure differential from a suction device. The system might be adapted for ongoing operation throughout a surgical intervention and could contain a powered suction mechanism able to provide most or the entirety of the pressure discrepancy needed to propel fluid through the filter system. A flow rate through the system could be approximately 3 liters every minute. The system could also feature an RF transceiver for liaising with a trocar, an insufflator, or a smartboom. The unit may further integrate one or more one-way valves, positioned at the vapor condensation chamber intake and/or exhaust, the filter media chamber ingestion and/or expulsion point, and/or the filter system intake and/or outlet. These valves could be automatic or electronic and designed to stay normally closed, ensuring no fluid within the filtration system escapes when the pressure trigger is disengaged.\n\n",

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to apparatus and methods for harvesting energy from the environment and other sources external to the harvester and converting it to useful electrical energy. The present invention generally relates to implantable stimulator systems and methods, and more particularly relates to implantable stimulator systems and methods utilizing one or more implantable microstimulators for direct electrical current. Specifically outlined is the use of PME for the delivery of microstimulation through applied external magnetic field technology. The delivered therapy will be effective for continuous or temporary, as needed (PRN) therapeutic intervention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Energy harvesters are known that convert vibrational energy into electrical energy. The electrical energy produced can then be stored or used by other devices. For example, the vibrations of an air conditioning duct can be converted into electrical energy by an energy harvester and the electrical energy then used to power a sensor that measures the air temperature in the duct. The sensor does not require electrical wiring to a remote source of power or periodic battery changes. There are a variety of such devices for generating electrical power from vibrations, oscillations or other mechanical motions. Generally such devices are categorized as inductive, capacitive, and/or piezoelectric devices. While each of the known types of vibrational energy harvesters have different advantages, they also have drawbacks such as: the need for heavy, powerful permanent magnets (in the case of inductive energy harvesters) to produce a sufficiently large flux density; an auxiliary source of power, such as a battery (in the case of capacitive harvesters); the need for large vibration frequencies and/or a heavy inertial mass to generate sufficient vibrational energy for harvesting (for all types of vibration energy harvesters); undesirable levels of damping and noise generation from interaction between the locally generated magnetic field and nearby metallic parts (for inductive harvesters); and other disadvantages such as size or weight that make them unsuitable for use in a remote or generally inaccessible location. As shown in FIG. 1 , a typical magnetic device 2 to harvest vibrational energy consists of a permanent magnet 3 (an internal local field source) attached to a housing 7 and connected by a spring 4 to a passive magnetic field sensor 5 (e.g., an induction coil or a passive magnetostrictive/electroactive field sensor). External vibrations cause a relative motion of the magnet 3 and sensor 5 , producing an electrical voltage across a load 8 and a current through the load. In addition to requiring a local magnetic field source (e.g., a permanent magnet disposed adjacent to the field sensor), these devices also typically include an inertial mass 6 (also known as a proof mass) to increase the vibrational energy generated. The inertial mass may be rigidly attached to the sensor (as shown), may be the same or separate from the permanent magnet, or may comprise part of the sensor itself. As a further alternative, the magnet may comprise part of the moving proof mass, as opposed to being fixed to the housing. In each case, the inertial mass and the permanent magnet increase the size and weight of the device. It would be desirable to provide a magnetic energy harvester that does not require a local magnetic field source as part of the device itself. It would also be beneficial to provide a magnetic energy harvester that does not require a source of vibrational or other mechanical motion. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for harvesting energy from the environment or other remote sources and converting it to useful electrical energy. The harvester does not contain a permanent magnet or other local field source but instead relies on the earth&#39;s magnetic field or another source of a magnetic field that is external to the sensing device. One advantage of these new harvesters is that they can be made smaller and lighter than energy harvesters that contain a magnet. Another advantage is that they do not require vibrational energy to function. According to various embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, the harvester differs from those of the prior art by the absence of a permanent magnet or other local (internal) field source. In these new devices, a change in the state of magnetization of the sensing element may be achieved in one (or both) of two general ways: 1. The magnetic flux density in the sensing element may be altered by changes in the orientation of the sensor (movement of the sensor) with respect to a static (non-changing) external field. For example, the magnetization vector M of the sensing element may rotate due to changes in the orientation of the sensing element with respect to the earth&#39;s field. Such movement of the sensing element may be achieved by attaching the sensing element to a piece of rotating machinery or a rotating part on a vehicle. Alternatively, the sensing element may be suspended on its axis and allowed to rotate (due to external vibrations), the rotation causing a change in its orientation in the earth&#39;s field. 2. Alternatively, the sensing element may remain stationary and be operated on by a remote changing magnetic field from any of a variety of sources. The remote changing magnetic field can be produced by an electrical transformer, motor, electronic device, moving machinery or inductive wire or coil which is relatively remote (acting at a distance or through a non-magnetic barrier) on the sensing element. The changing (e.g., alternating) magnetic field source can be designed to couple with a remote sensing element efficiently in terms of frequency, distance, field orientation and magnitude to deliver power remotely to the sensing element. When operating from the earth&#39;s magnetic field, the power harvested may be less than that achieved with a prior art vibrational energy harvester having a built-in magnetic field. The power harvested from a remote field source will be measured in microwatts per centimeter cubed (\u03bcW/cm 3 ), as opposed to milliwatts per centimeter cubed (mW/cm 3 ) for energy harvesters that include a strong magnet. However, for certain applications the power delivered by such a small, lightweight and simple energy harvester will be sufficient and enable new applications. When operating near some man-made external sources of alternating magnetic fields, or when such an external field source is brought near to the energy harvester, the power harvested can be considerably greater because the strength of such fields is often considerably greater than the earth&#39;s magnetic field (H earth is approximately 0.3 Oe or 3 micro-Tesla). A preferred sensing element for use in the present invention is based on a class of passive magnetostrictive electroactive (PME) magnetic field sensors that produce a voltage when exposed to a changing magnetic field. The sensing element is preferably a layered structure (e.g., sandwich) of magnetostrictive material bonded to an electroactive material, the latter being poled in a direction preferably parallel to the plane of the magnetostrictive layer(s). An external magnetic field causes a magnetization change in the magnetostrictive layer(s), which respond(s) with a magnetoelastic stress. Part of the stress is transferred to the electroactive layer that responds by producing a voltage given by V i =g ij \u03c3 j L i. Here, L i is the distance between the electrodes across which the voltage V i is measured, \u03c3 j is the stress transferred to the electroactive component, and g ij is the stress-voltage coupling coefficient. The voltage is greatest when the direction i=j. However, in different applications the principal stress and induced voltage may lie in orthogonal directions (e.g., 1-3 operation), or the principal stress and voltage may act along different axes (e.g., 1-5 operation). The energy harvester of the present invention is more than a simple passive magnetostrictive/electroactive (PME) field sensor. A simple PME field sensor is comprised of materials and dimensions designed preferably to produce a large voltage across a high impedance circuit, the voltage being indicative of the field of interest. The electronic circuit for a simple PME sensor is designed to register a field value. In contrast, the PME energy harvester of the present invention is comprised of materials and dimensions designed preferably to produce a voltage and current that match the impedance of the load to be driven. The PME energy harvester is coupled to an electronic circuit that converts the PME output to power for immediate use or storage. The PME element is preferably optimized to respond to the field strength of the intended environment, which would generally be much greater than that of a pure field sensor. This new type of energy harvester can be simpler, lighter and/or more compact than those requiring a permanent magnet as a field source, and also those requiring an inertial mass for enhancing vibrational energy. For example, suitable applications may include wireless monitoring applications, wherein wireless monitoring is meant to include self powered sensing of local conditions and processing of the sensor output and self powered wireless communication to a central data processing point. Other suitable applications might include wireless transfer of electrical power over a small distance to a location inaccessible via electrical leads or not convenient for battery replacement. More specifically, these applications may include supplying power for: wireless health monitoring or condition based maintenance; supplementing power or recharging batteries without physically accessing them; elimination of wiring of electrical devices remote from a power source; wireless monitoring of temperature, airflow, humidity and gas content in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; wireless monitoring of traffic flow, turbulence, noise or personnel movement; wireless, self powered security systems; powering of mobile electronic instruments; passive detection of creep or crack propagation in structures for condition based maintenance; and powering of devices implanted in a living body (or to another inaccessible location) for purposes of sensing, transmitting, or actuating (e.g., motors, pumps, switches, valves, electrodes), as well as for accomplishing therapy or other functions that require a voltage and/or current. Furthermore, applications of the new energy harvester are not limited to vibration rich environments. A simple repetitive motion or rotation of the more sensitive PME devices as described herein allows them to operate from the earth&#39;s magnetic field. They can be placed in physically inaccessible locations and activated from a remote field source that is either present in the environment or placed there for the purpose of energizing the device. In one embodiment of the invention: an energy harvester without a local field source comprises: a magnetic field sensing element including one or more layers of magnetostrictive material having a magnetization vector that responds to variations in an applied magnetic field by generating a stress, and one or more layers of electroactive material, mechanically bonded to the layer of magnetostrictive material, that responds to the stress by generating a voltage; and a circuit coupled to the sensing element that converts the voltage to electrical power for immediate use or storage, wherein the sensing element either: a) moves relative to a remote static external magnetic field, such that changes in orientation of the sensing element with respect to the external field generates the voltage; or b) is stationary with respect to a remote changing external magnetic field, wherein the changing external field causes the sensing element to generate the voltage. In Various Embodiments the electrical power comprises a voltage and current suitable for an intended application; the magnetostrictive material layer has a magnetization vector that responds to variations in the magnetic field by rotating in a plane and wherein the electroactive material is poled in a direction substantially parallel to the plane in which the magnetization vector rotates; the sensing element is mounted to an object that moves relative to the applied magnetic field; the variations in the applied external field are in one or more of magnitude and direction of the field; the sensing element is mounted such that local vibration changes its orientation with respect to the applied magnetic field; the sensing element includes electrodes for measuring the voltage generated and wherein the electrodes are configured such that the distance between the electrodes and cross sectional area between the electrodes are tailored to produce a desired electrical power; the magnetization vector rotates relative to the electrode axis due to changes in the orientation of the sensor in the applied external field; local vibrations also change the orientation of the sensor with respect to the applied external field; the remote magnetic field is generated by one or more of an electrical transformer, motor, actuator, switch, electronic device, moving machinery or inductor; the inductor is a wire or coil through which an alternating current is flowing, to produce the remote changing external magnetic field; the sensing element is rigidly attached to an inertial mass; the sensing element includes an inertial mass; the changing external field or sensing element movement is at vibration or power transmission frequencies of no greater than 1 kHz; the changing external field is at a resonance frequency in the range of that of the sensing element; the changing external field is in a range of 20 to 50 kHz; the external field frequency is equal to or close to the resonance frequency of the sensor, which varies roughly according to the equation fr \u2248 1 2 \u2062 L \u2062 E eff \u03c1 eff where L is a characteristic length of the sensor and E eff and \u03c1 eff are the elastic modulus and mass density appropriate to describe the composite magnetostrictive/electroactive sensor properties; the changing external field and sensing element are within a resonant frequency range; the circuit is within the resonant frequency range; the external changing field is outside a human or other animal body and the sensing element is inside the body. In another embodiment of the invention, a method of harvesting energy comprises: providing a magnetic field sensing element including one or more layers of magnetostrictive material having a magnetization vector that responds to variations in an applied magnetic field by generating a stress, and one or more layers of an electroactive material, mechanically bonded to the layer of magnetostrictive material, that responds to the stress by generating a voltage; wherein the voltage is generated by either: moving the sensing element relative to a remote static external magnetic field, such that changes in orientation in the sensing element with respect to the external field generates the voltage; or the sensing element is stationary with respect to a remote changing external magnetic field, and the changing external field causes the sensing elemenet to generate the voltage; and converting the generated voltage to electrical power for immediate use or storage. The invention disclosed and claimed herein addresses the above and other needs and provides means and systems for acutely stimulating a nerve root(s), spinal nerve(s), organs, soft tissue, incision site or similar, with a miniature implantable neurostimulator(s) that can be implanted via a minimal surgical procedure and powered by an external magnetic field. This invention describes a means of delivering power wirelessly from outside the body to inside the body for the therapies described above. The means of wireless power delivery consists of a passive magnetostrictive/electro-active (PME) magnetic-field sensor as the main component of a small implantable device that will receive a changing magnetic field from an external alternating magnetic field source external to the body. This field source may be a hand-held device or a small antenna affixed to the wearer&#39;s skin, clothing or accessories. Alternatively, the external field may be generated by a source planted in a chair, desk, car seat or table that the recipient frequents. The AC magnetic field excites the implanted PME sensor, which generates a voltage and current that can be used to provide therapeutic relief by stimulating nerve. The therapeutic system can also be used to minimize tissue damage, reduce tumor size and burden, or stimulate bone or cartilage growth in the appropriate space. An AC magnetic field is a more efficient means of transmitting power than an AC electric field because of the greater attenuation of electric fields by body fluids. The proposed system would include an external source of alternating magnetic field close to the recipient or in a wearable device that is made up of a power source (line power, battery, rechargeable battery or energy harvester) and electronics to control the signal generated by the wearable antenna. The antenna is connected to the wearable device with a wire and affixed to the skin or cloth in the area of interest to perform two functions: First, the antenna transmits data to communicate with the implanted devices. Second, the antenna transmits a signal that is converted by the implanted PME sensor/harvester (part of the implanted device) into useful power for the entire implanted device. The implanted PME provides a tiny implant that may be millimeter scale in size that can be driven by an external magnetic field applied only on an as needed basis. For example, patients with migraine headaches can be treated with therapeutic electricity applied to the occipital nerve. The patient does not however express this headache chronically, rather the headache appears only on an intermittently acute basis. Therefore applying the magnetic field during the earliest (prodromal) period of the headache can prevent conversion to a migraine headache. This would be one therapeutic embodiment of the technology. Stimulation and control parameters of the implanted micro-stimulator are preferably adjusted to levels that are safe and efficacious with minimal patient discomfort. Different stimulation parameters generally have different effects on neural tissue, and parameters are thus chosen to target specific neural populations and to exclude others."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an oximeter device for measuring the oxygen saturation degree in arterial blood. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART There has been proposed a probe calibration device of an oximeter device titled &#34;CALIBRATED OPTICAL OXIMETER PROBE&#34; (referred to as First Prior Example hereinafter) in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,643. The first prior example is characterized in that the probe device which is used together with the optical oximeter body for obtaining data of blood of a patient comprises; light emitting means for emitting light of a known narrow wavelength range, a photosensor for detecting the intensity of the light passed through a patient to be measured, a coding means for applying the data signal of the known narrow wavelength to the optical oximeter body with respect to the probe and a connection device for attachably and removably attaching the coding means, the photosensor and the light emitting means to the oximeter body, whereby the oximeter body receives the data signal at the coding means so as to determine the frequency of light emitted by the light emitting means, and subsequently calculate the oxygen saturation based on the determined frequency. There has been proposed a general organism data measuring device (referred to as Second Prior Example hereinafter) in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,392. The above mentioned organism data measuring device measures the data of the organism and comprises; a transducer for measuring an organism data to be required and for converting the organism data into a corresponding electrical data, a memory means for storing a calibration data calculated in accordance with the reference characteristic of said transducer, a calibration means for calibrating the converted organism data based on the calibration data, a reading means for reading out the calibration data stored in the memory means, and a calibration control means for controlling the reading means to read out the calibration data and selecting a corresponding part of the calibration data to the organism data measured by the transducer, and for controlling the calibration means to calibrate the converted organism data in accordance with the selected part of the calibrated data. In the above mentioned first prior example, the light of a predetermined wavelength radiated from the light emitting means is applied to the photosensor through the examined organism and the output of the photosensor is processed by a predetermined calculation so as to calculate the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 in the arterial blood of the organism. But, for example, in case the light emitting means emit not only the light of a narrow wavelength range but also the light of a comparatively wide wavelength range or emit a light of another wavelength than the main wavelength (referred to as the light of a sub-wavelength), there occurs an error in the calculation value of the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2. Moreover, in case two light emitting means, for example, are used in order to calculate the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 and the light emitting spectrums of the two emitting devices are overlapped with each other, or in case each data of the light emitted by the above mentioned two emitting means is mixed in the process of the calculation of the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 and can not be obtained separately at the output of the processing circuit of the above mentioned calculation so that crosstalk exists, there has been a problem that there occurs an error in the calculation value of the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2. Furthermore, the latter second prior example comprises a calibration means for performing the calibration process of the calculation data at the time of calculating the data of the organism, but the concrete means or ways of calculating the oxygen saturation degree are not disclosed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An essential object of the present invention is to provide an oximeter device which is able to measure the oxygen saturation degree in the arterial blood of an organism to be examined correctly even though there is dispersion of the spectrums of the light emitting devices or there is a crosstalk as mentioned above. The oximeter device according to the present invention comprises; a probe device comprising light emitting means, light receiving means and memory means for storing data necessary for the calculation of the oxygen saturation degree in the arterial blood of the examined organism caused by the light emitting means and the light receiving means, and calculation means for reading out the data signal of the memory means and executing the calculation of the oxygen saturation degree on the basis of the read-out data signal and the output of the light receiving means when the probe device is connected to the oximeter device. By the arrangement as mentioned above, the data necessary for the calculation of the oxygen saturation degree in the arterial blood of the examined organism caused by the light emitting means and the light receiving means are stored in the memory means and the data stored in the memory means are read out by the calculation means and then the calculation of the oxygen saturation degree is executed on the basis of the read-out data and the output of the light receiving means so as to obtain the oxygen saturation degree.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In FIG. 1, the oximeter device comprises a probe 1 and a main unit 3. The probe 1 is detachably connected to the main unit 3. In the probe 1, there is provided a pair of a red light emitting diode 20 and an infrared ray emitting diode 21 disposed to project a red light and an infrared ray toward an object organism 60 such as a finger to be measured. The red light emitting diode (referred to as RLED hereinafter) 20 emits red light 71 (see FIG. 3) of the main wavelength such as nearly 660 nm and emitting infrared ray 72 of the sub-wavelength such as 900 nm of which the light intensity is lower than that of the main wavelength light as shown in FIG. 3. The infrared light emitting diode (referred to as IRLED hereinafter) 21 emits an infrared ray 73 of the wavelength of nearly 940 nm. A temperature detecting unit 22 is provided near the RLED 20 and IRLED 21 for generating a signal representing the temperature of RLED 20 or IRLED 21. A probe discrimination generator 24 generates the signal for indicating which of a spot measuring probe or a continuous measuring probe is used. A light receiving element 25 made of a photodiode is disposed at a position opposing to said RLED 20 and IRLED 21 so as to receive the light which is radiated from RLED 20 and IRLED 21 and passed through the organism 60, thereby generating a signal corresponding to the intensity of light passed through the organism 60. Moreover, there are provided a photoelectric converter 37 for converting the output of the light receiving element 25 into a signal of a predetermined level and a non-volatile memory circuit 56 which is connected to a central processing unit (referred to as CPU) 10 in the main unit 3 through a data bus and stores the data of the luminous spectrums of RLED 20 and IRLED 21 and the data of crosstalk amount and sum check data. In the above mentioned embodiment, though the non-volatile memory circuit 56 is connected to CPU 10 via the data bus, both of the devices 10 and 56 may be connected via a single line so as to transfer the data serially. Moreover, the memory circuit 56 may be made of an EEPROM or EPROM in which the data can be electrically written and erased and may be made by a digital switch. As shown in FIG. 4, the memory circuit 56 stores eleven items with respect to the properties of the light or ray of the RLED 20 and IRLED 21 as follows; (1) the intensity of the main wavelength light of RLED 20 when a predetermined driving current is supplied, (2) the intensity of the main wavelength light of IRLED 21 when a predetermined driving current is supplied, (3) the wavelength of the main wavelength light of RLED 20, (4) the half width of the main wavelength light of RLED 20, (5) the wavelength of the sub-wavelength light of RLED 20, (6) the ratio of the intensity of light of the subwavelength light to that of the main wavelength light of RLED 20, (7) the wavelength of the light of IRLED 21, (8) the half width of the light of IRLED 21, (9) the crosstalk amount caused in case of mixing the light signal of RLED 20 into the processing circuit of the light of IRLED 21 (referred to as crosstalk amount from R channel to IR channel hereinafter) to be described later, (10) the crosstalk amount caused in case of mixing the light signal of IRLED 21 into the processing circuit of the light of RLED 20 (referred to as crosstalk amount from IR channel to R channel hereinafter) to be described later, and (11) the sum check data. The sum check data is so determined that the sum of the data (1) to (11) amounts to a predetermined value. The sum check data is used to detect whether each of the data (1) to (10) is correctly stored or not in the memory circuit 56. There are provided in the main unit 3 a signal processing circuit 7 for processing the output of the light receiving element 25 in the probe 1 to be described later. A multiplexer 8 selects the output of the signal processing circuit 7, an analogue to digital converter 9 (referred to as A/D converter hereinafter) for converting the analogue output signal of the multiplexer 8 into a digital signal. CPU 10 calculates the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 in arterial blood and the pulse rate of the organism 60 and controls a display unit 13 and an operating unit 14, a read only memory (referred to as ROM hereinafter) 11, and a random access memory (referred to as RAM hereinafter) 12. The display unit 13 displays the calculated oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 in the arterial blood and the pulse rate. The operation unit 14 selects an alarm level and a measuring mode/display mode of the oximeter device. A voice generator 15 generates an alarm sound and the sound of the pulse of the organism. An input-and-output interface 16 sends and receives the data to and from a printer and an external personal computer and generates the wave-form of the pulse. An IC card input and output unit 17 sends and receives the data of the calculation value to and from the IC card 2. 18 denotes a clock portion. A light emitting diode (referred to as LED) driving portion 19 supplies power to RLED 20 and IRLED 21 for turning them on. The principle of calculating the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 in the arterial blood according to the present embodiment will be explained. When the lights of wavelength \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are radiated to the organism 60, the luminance intensities I 1 and I 2 of the lights of the wavelengths \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 having passed through the organism 60 may be represented as follows; I.sub.1 =Io.sub.1 \u00d7Tt.sub.1 \u00d7exp{-g.sub.1 [(E.sub.1 O-E.sub.1 H) Sa0.sub.2 /100+E.sub.1 H]\u00d7(d+\u0394d)] (1) I.sub.2 =Io.sub.2 \u00d7Tt.sub.2 \u00d7exp{-g.sub.2 [(E.sub.2 O-E.sub.2 H)\u00d7Sa0.sub.2 /100+E.sub.2 H]\u00d7(d+\u0394d)] (2), wherein Io 1 : the intensity of the incident light of wavelength \u03bb 1 , Io 2 : the intensity of the incident light of wavelength \u03bb 2 , E 1 O: the absorption coefficient of oxyhemoglobin at the wavelength \u03bb 1 of the light, E 2 0: the absorption coefficient of oxyhemoglobin at the wavelength \u03bb 2 of the light, E 1 H: the absorption coefficient of hemoglobin at the wavelength \u03bb 1 of the light, E 2 H: the absorption coefficient of hemoglobin at the wavelength \u03bb 2 of the light, Tt 1 : the transmittance of the tissue other than the arterial blood at the wavelength \u03bb 1 of the light, Tt 2 : the transmittance of the tissue other than the arterial blood at the wavelength \u03bb 2 of the light, d: the averaged thickness of the arterial blood layer, \u0394d: the variable component of the thickness of the arterial blood layer, Sa0 2 : the oxygen saturation degree in the arterial blood, g 1 , g 2 : the coefficient of the gain. Assuming that the DC components of the luminances I 1 and I 2 of the lights of each wavelength after passing through the organism 60 are represented by I 1 DC and I 2 DC respectively and the values log(I 1 DC/I 1 ) and log(I 2 DC/I 2 ) are represented by U 1 and U 2 respectively, the values U 1 and U 2 may be approximately represented as follows; U.sub.1 =g.sub.1 [(E.sub.1 O-E.sub.1 H)Sa0.sub.2 /100+E.sub.1 H]\u0394d(3) U.sub.2 =g.sub.2 [(E.sub.2 O-E.sub.2 H)Sa0.sub.2 /100+E.sub.2 H]\u0394d (4) Moreover, assuming that the values U 1 and U 2 may be obtained as the variable components of the values log I 1 and log I 2 and that the variable components of the intensities of lights I 1 and I 2 are \u0394I 1 and \u0394I 2 , the values U 1 and U 2 may be obtained as the values \u0394I 1 /I 1 DC, \u0394I 2 /I 2 DC respectively so as to obtain the expressions (3) and (4). Next, from the expressions (3) and (4), the value of the oxygen saturation degree Sa0 2 in the arterial blood may be obtained as follows; Sa0.sub.2 ={K.sub.1 (U.sub.1 /U.sub.2).sup.2 +K.sub.2 }/{K.sub.3 (U.sub.1 /U.sub.2).sup.2 +K.sub.4 }\u00d7100 (5) wherein the numerals K 1 , K 2 , K 3 and K 4 represent respectively constant values determined by the wavelengths \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2. In the present embodiment, the wavelengths of approximately 660 nm and 940 nm are adopted as the wavelengths \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2. The arrangement of the signal processing circuit 7 in the device body 3 according to the present invention is explained with reference to FIG. 2. In the present embodiment, as described above, as the light sources there are mainly adopted RLED 20 emitting the red light of the wavelength nearly 660 nm and IRLED 21 emitting the infrared ray of the wavelength nearly 940 nm. Each of RLED 20 and IRLED 21 is respectively driven by the LED driving unit 19 which is controlled by the timing pulse generated by an oscillator included in CPU 10. The LED driving unit 19 generates two series of the driving periodic pulses having the same cycle, the phase difference of 90\u00b0 and the duty ratio 50%. These pulses are fed to RLED 20 and IRLED 21 so as to turn RLED 20 and IRLED 21 on respectively as shown in FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b). The light emitted from RLED 20 and IRLED 21 passes through the organism 60 and are declined and then received by the light receiving element 25, which generates electric current corresponding to the intensity of the incident light and the generated current is converted into voltage through a photoelectric converter 37 and fed to the terminal a 1 of the switch S 1. In case the device body 3 is set in the measuring mode, the switch S 1 is connected to the terminal a 1 so that the output of the photoelectric converter 37 is amplified through an amplifier 38 and in turn inputted to a R-synchronous rectifier 39 and an IR-synchronous rectifier 40. The R-synchronous rectifier 39 is synchronized with one of the two series of the driving periodic pulses, pulse (a) in FIG. 5 generated from the LED driving unit 19 and rectify the signal of red light inputted from the converter 37. In other words, the R-synchronous rectifier 39 amplifies the input signal by a gain of 1 while RLED 20 emits the light and amplifies the input signal by a gain of -1 while RLED 20 does not emit the light. Similarly, the IR-synchronous rectifier 40 is synchronized with another series of the driving periodic pulses (b) and amplifies the input signal by a gain of 1 while IRLED 21 emits the light and amplifies the input signal by a gain of -1 while IRLED 21 does not emit the light. The time average value of the output of the synchronous rectifiers 40 corresponds to the intensity of the light of only IRLED 21 passed through the organism 60. Therefore, the outputs of a R low-pass filter 41 and an IR low-pass filter 42 corresponds respectively to the intensity of the light of wavelengths around 660 nm and 940 nm having passed through the organism 60."

  "negative": "A state-of-the-art seeding device for transferring seeds from a storage container to specific growth environments incorporates a frame situated on a sturdy base adapted for resting on a predetermined platform. The framework supports a seed reservoir with a uniform base and a transfer manifold for seed relocation. It also supports a hand-controlled seed suction unit, which moves in a straight path and varies in altitude to transition from the seed reservoir to the transfer manifold. A suction source connects to the suction unit, providing negative pressure through a series of evenly spaced holes on the suction unit's forward section. Each hole is designed with dimensions smaller than the seeds, allowing the seeds to be secured above the holes due to the suction. The holes are always visible to the operator, ensuring efficient monitoring. A flexible conduit serves as the vacuum channel. To disengage the seeds from the holes, an alternate conduit connected to the suction unit supplies a stream of pressurized gas on command. An innovative internal mechanism within the suction unit governs the pressure at the holes, facilitating either a vacuum or expulsion of air. The transfer manifold adjacent to the seed reservoir boasts numerous aligned openings on its top aspect that match with the holes on the suction unit to accept the seeds. An assembly of downward-leading tubes connects with the manifold openings, concluding in adjustable endpoints above the growth mediums. Initially, the operator engages the vacuum, lowers the suction unit, and shifts it across the seed reservoir, ensuring that each hole captures the required seeds with all actions visible to the operator. Upon securing the seeds, the unit is moved to align with the manifold, the vacuum is ceased, and the seeds drop by gravity. If any seeds remain post-vacuum, a blast of gas ensures release. The process is continuously repeatable, with the operator ensuring loose seeds due to the reciprocal motion of the seed suction unit. Drawings accompany this description, illustrating various perspectives of the seeding device and components, emphasizing the manual interaction aspect and the straightforward, operator-visible process of seed transfer.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application, Ser. No. 573,412, filed May 1, 1975, entitled &#34;Seed Planter&#34;, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,638, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to automatic and semi-automatic seeders. More specifically, the invention relates to a seeder for use in the bedding plant industry which will reliably pick up seeds from a seed tray and deposit them in a predetermined array into a flat or into peat cups. The problem of getting millions of seedlings planted in a short period of time has forced the horticultural nursery industry into mechanizing this operation. Horticulturists have recognized that direct seeding by machine can greatly cut labor costs in the initial planting of the seeds. By initially planting the seeds in individual peat cups, the step of transplanting the plants from flats to peat cups is eliminated. Thus, there is no setback in growth due to transplanting, and the plants are not contaminated by the handling associated with transplanting. U.S. Pat. No. 2,546,838 to Carl H. Tasche describes a seeder with a suction header which has a coordinate array of downwardly projecting suction tubes. Upon producing a suction in the header, the tubes pick up seeds from a seed tray. The header is then slidably moved on a horizontal track to a position over a flat where the suction is cut off and the tubes deposit the seeds in a coordinate array. U.S. Pat. No. 2,445,701 describes a seed counting machine using a similar principle. Jiffy Products of America of West Chicago, Illinois, sells a Fricke-Jiffy Seeder which is designed to pick up and distribute through an arrangement of tubes of maximum of 96 seeds into a large flat. The Fricke-Jiffy Seeder is described in an article in the September 1970 issue of Grower Talks magazine published by Geo. J. Ball, Inc., of West Chicago, Illinois 60185. The previously described prior art devices incorporate hollow suction tubes which point downward and are mechanically lowered into the seed tray to pick up seeds. It has been found that in normal operation, a certain percentage, around 10 percent, of the tubes will not pick up a seed in a given cycle. The operator has no way to visually inspect the ends of the tubes to determine whether each tube has picked up a seed. Furthermore, when the seed tray empties to less than one-half full, the seeds in the tray tend to pack into a hard layer and thus become much harder to pick up. Periodic refilling and stirring of the seeds is necessary to alleviate this problem. This packing phenomenon occurs most noticeably with &#34;fuzzy&#34; tomato seeds. Thus, in this era of increasing labor cost, there is an acute need for an improved semi-automatic seeder for the small to medium sized nursery which allows essentially 100 percent pick up of seeds and which allows the operator to view each suction hole to assure that a seed has been picked up by each hole. Also, the seeder should be operable with a low level of seeds in the seed tray to prevent the unnecessary waste of unused seeds. The prior art practice was improved upon and the previously mentioned objectives were accomplished by the subject matter of copending application, Ser. No. 573,412, which provides a seeding apparatus for transferring seeds from a seed supply to a flat or individual peat cups. This seeding apparatus incorporates a hand-manipulated seed pick-up head and a seed tray which holds the supply of seeds to be planted. The seed tray has a substantially flat bottom and interconnecting sides and is adapted to hold a predetermined supply of seeds. A vacuum source is connected to the pick-up head for providing a suction force through a horizontal line of equally-spaced apertures on the frontal face of the pick-up head. The apertures are smaller than the seeds so that the seeds are held in place over the apertures. These apertures are readily visible by the operator at all times so that he may check on the efficiency of operation, i.e., he can see which apertures have seeds and which do not. A manifold positioned adjacent to the seed tray of this apparatus provides a plurality of horizontally aligned and spaced openings along an upper surface. These openings are positioned and spaced so as to mate with the apertures on the face of the head so as to receive the seeds when released. An array of plastic tubes communicate with the openings and extend downwardly to deposit the seeds. A disadvantage of this apparatus is that the seeds sometimes stick to the frontal face of the pickup head when the vacuum is released. In this regard, it becomes an object of the present invention to provide means for assuring that all of the seeds secured to the frontal face are released when desired. Other objects, including a simpler means for positioning the tubes over the peat cups, will become apparent from the specification. Also, an improved valve is provided. While applicant&#39;s copending application apparatus provides a much needed and greatly improved seeding apparatus, it becomes an object of the present invention to improve upon such apparatus while maintaining its many advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A seeding apparatus for transferring seeds from a seed supply to a flat or individual peat cups incorporates a support frame mounted on legs which are adapted to reside upon a worktable or other suitable surface. The frame mounts a seed tray having a substantially flat base and a manifold utilized in transferring the seeds. The frame also mounts a hand-manipulated seed pick-up head which is placed on rollers for rectilinear movement and which has a limited vertical range of motion for moving from the seed tray to the manifold levels. A vacuum source is connected to the pick-up head for providing a suction force through a line of equally-spaced apertures on a frontal face of the pick-up head. Each aperture is centered on a convex raised area on the frontal face surface. The apertures are smaller than the seeds so that the seeds are held in place on the convex surface over the apertures. The convex surface aids in making the seed covered apertures visible to the operator at all times and aids in preventing the seeds from sticking to apertures. A flexible hose is used as the vacuum line. A second line is connected to the pick-up head for providing a flow of pressurized air to the apertures when it is desired to release the seeds from the apertures. A novel valve arrangement within the pick-up head allows for positive, negative or neutral pressure conditions at the apertures. The valve includes a resilient ball member attached to a valve stem and which may be moved from a normally open position to a seated or closed position. When in the closed position, a number of openings connected to the exhaust port of the vacuum are uncovered so that a positive pressure may be applied to the seed pick-up apertures. A manifold positioned adjacent to the seed tray has a plurality of horizontally aligned and spaced openings along an upper surface which mate with the apertures on the face of the pick-up head so as to receive the seeds when released. An array of plastic tubes communicate with the openings and extend from beneath the manifold with the lower ends of the tubes being received by adjustable guides positioned above the peat cups. Once the vacuum is applied to the pick-up head, the head is lowered by the operator and is manually rolled along the provided track so that the pick-up head is drawn through the seed supply tray and each aperture picks up a desired number of seeds, all of which are in the view of the operator. After picking up the seeds, the head is manually rolled along the track in a slightly raised position to a point where the head is positioned on the manifold so that the apertures align with the openings in the manifold. Upon cutoff of the vacuum supply the seeds are free to drop from the face of the seed pick-up head so as to fall by gravity through the manifold openings and tubes and into the peat cups. Should the seed fail to drop when the vacuum is released, a pressurized air supply line may be used to supply a puff of air to the apertures thereby forcing the seeds free. The process is then repeated by manually rolling the raised pick-up head back to a position over the supply tray and repeating the operation. The seeds in the supply tray are always maintained loose due to the back and forth motion applied to the seed pick-up head by the operator. The operator can assure an efficient operation since he always has view of the apertures in the pick-up head face. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of the seed planter of the present invention with the pick-up head in a raised position prior to it being moved forward into the seed supply tray. FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of the seed planter shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is an enlarged front elevation view of the pick-up head employed in the present invention. FIG. 4 is a section view taken substantially along line 4--4 of FIG. 3 disclosing the internal features of the valve with the open position shown in solid lines and the closed position in dashed lines. FIG. 5 is a section view taken along line 5--5 of FIG. 1 illustrating the adjustable tube positioning feature of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, the seed planter 10 of the present invention comprises an upper support frame having top members 11 and vertical support members 12 and a bottom support frame which includes sides 13, front wall 14 and back wall 16. Support members 12 are made integral with sidewalls 13. Four adjustable legs 17 are secured to front and back walls 14, 16 for supporting the planter on a table top, or the like. A seed supply tray 19 and two manifold blocks 20 are mounted in a fixed position on top members 11 by bolts or any other suitable means. Seed tray 19 has a substantially flat bottom and interconnecting sides. Each manifold 20 has a flat top wall surface and an upright wall extending from the flat surface and formed with a plurality of curved recessed cavities. A plurality of holes aligned with the cavities extend downwardly through each manifold 20. These cavities and holes are positioned, as seen from later description, to align with the apertures on the pick-up head from which the seeds are deposited. A detailed description of a form of manifold construction is found in copending application Ser. No. 573,412 and will not be repeated since it suits the invention. A pick-up head carriage 23 is mounted on top members 11 by means of four rollers 28 which move between track or rail members 25. Carriage 23 includes a pair of angle members 27 on which the rollers 28 are mounted. A pair of vertical support members 29 extend from angle members 27 and each is pivotally secured to an arm member 30 by a pivot pin 31. Arm members 30 are also pivotally secured to a pair of support brackets 36 by pivot pins 35. Support brackets 36 are, in turn, fixedly secured to the pick-up head by welds or the like at 37 (see FIGS. 2 and 3). A pair of springs 34 provide an upward bias on arms 30. Thus, pick-up head 24 may be vertically moved about fixed pivot pins 31 during operation. A pair of stop bosses 33 provide an upper limitation on the movement of pick-up head 24 and a lower limitation on such movement is provided by the base of the seed tray 19. Referring to FIG. 3, seed pick-up head 24 includes tubular members 40 which provide an air passage. The seed receiving member 41 is made from tubing similar to members 40 but with its face area 42 providing a flattened surface which includes a plurality of equally-spaced apertures 43. Apertures 43 are centered on convex raised surfaces 44 which form a part of face area 42. As previously stated, apertures 43 align with the holes in manifold 20. In the illustrated embodiment, head 24 includes 24 apertures 43 which align with 24 cavities in each of the two manifolds 20. Thus, by depositing 24 seeds in the first manifold and then picking up 24 more seeds and depositing them in the second manifold, the operator may fill 48 peat cups (corresponding to four rows with 12 in each row as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2). By providing additional manifolds, the number of peat cups filled may be increased to 72, 96 or any multiple of 24. Of course, a pick-up head having more or less than 24 aligned pick-up apertures may be utilized provided the manifolds have an equal number of spaced openings for receiving the seed. An electric vacuum pump 70 is situated at the rear of the support frame and is held in place by upright member 71. Vacuum pump 70 connects to a flexible, extendible vacuum hose 65 which in turn connects to seed pick-up head 24 through a valve assembly 50. Hose 65 is supported by a hose support bracket 72 which is integrally secured to upright 26. A second flexible, extendible line 74 passes from the exhaust or pressure side of pump 70 and enters a heat exchange chamber 75 positioned immediately below seed tray 19. The exhaust from pump 70 is somewhat warmer than ambient so that a warm base surface is maintained in tray 19 when pump 70 is in operation. It has been found that the heat helps to prevent the seeds from packing and sticking together. The heated air forced through heat exchange chamber 75 is allowed to exit through a pipe 77 which emerges from the side of chamber 75. A pressurized air supply line 59 has one end terminating within pipe 77 and, as explained below, has the other end terminating within valve 50. During operation, the exhaust within pipe 77 simply flows past line 59 and exhausts to the air. However, once valve 50 is moved to its closed position, the operator can place the palm of his hand momentarily over the opening to pipe 77 and pressurized air will be forced through line 59 into valve 50, through pick-up head 24 and out apertures 43. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, valve assembly 50 includes a pair of hollow members 51, 52 with member 52 being of slightly larger diameter and capable of receiving member 51 and the two being held together by a screw 53. A T-connection 54 is integrally secured by welding to members 51 and 40, and provides an air passage from valve 50 to members 40. A boss 55 integral with T-connection 54 mounts a spring 56 which biases the valve stem 57 outwardly to the open position shown in solid lines in FIG. 4. Stem 57 has at its lower end a finger engagable plunger member 58 and at its upper end a resilient ball member 63. Ball 63 is held on stem 57 by nut 64 and is of a diameter large enough so that when stem 57 is moved inward against the bias of spring 56, ball 63 will close off the communication with vacuum base 65 by seating in the constricted upper portion of member 52 (see the dashed lines in FIG. 4). Thus, a simple vertical displacement of stem 57 moves valve 50 from an open to a closed position. Valve 50 is also designed so that a flow of air may be directed into head 24 and out apertures 43. As best shown in FIG. 4, the previously mentioned pressurized air supply line 59 passes through and is made integral with member 51. The top area 60 of line 59 is flattened and has four holes 61 which communicate with the interior of valve 50. A seal 62 is integrally secured to shaft 57 and when valve 50 is in the open position shown in solid lines in FIG. 4, seal 62 closes off holes 61. When valve 50 is moved to the closed position, seal 62 uncovers holes 61 so that line 59 may communicate with the interior of valve 50 and with the pick-up head 24. When valve 50 is in this closed position, the operator may place the palm of his hand over the end of exhaust pipe 77 thereby forcing a flow of air through line 59 and to apertuers 43. This slight flow of air is useful to dislodge seed which may stick to the pick-up head even after the vacuum is removed. Thus, it can be seen that the apertures 43 may be placed in three pressure conditions: (1) unpressurized (neutral pressure), (2) vacuum (negative pressure), or (3) pressurized (positive pressure). Neutral pressure is achieved either when the vacuum pump 70 is off or when the valve is closed. Negative pressure is achieved when the pump 70 is energized and the valve is allowed to remain in its normally closed position. Positive pressure is achieved when pump 70 is energized, valve 50 is closed and a flow of air is forced into line 59 by the operator placing the palm of his hand over the end of pipe 77. Turning now to a description of the means for delivering the seeds to the peat cups, a plurality of flexible plastic lines 81 extend from the respective apertures in manifold 20 downward through their respective guide tubes 82. Guide tubes 82 are held in place by adjustable positioning supports 84. FIG. 5 illustrates one of such guide tubes 82 and its respective support 84 in larger scale."

  "query": "What type of catheter allows for the deployment of multiple stents in varying orders within a cardiovascular system?,",
  "negative": "FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY [0001] The present document discusses medical devices, specifically addressing improvements in multi-stent delivery systems for surgical procedures. BACKGROUND [0002] Cardiovascular obstructions can result from plaque accumulation leading to narrowed or blocked passages. Traditional approaches, such as angioplasty, involve inserting a balloon-tipped catheter to dilate the obstructed region. Often, a stent is mounted onto the balloon to support the vessel once the balloon is withdrawn. Multi-stenosis treatments may require several stent placements in one session, which traditionally necessitates multiple catheter insertions, causing patient discomfort and elevated risks. [0003] A known technology discloses a catheter capable of deploying various stents. The device features segments capable of individual expansion to release stents upon application of an axial force. After expansion, the force is removed, and the catheter is repositioned for subsequent stent deployments. SUMMARY [0004] The described system comprises a catheter designed for the introduction and deployment of numerous stents, potentially of varying diameters. An inflatable element is utilized to deploy a stent encircling it. A positioning mechanism allows for the stent to be shifted relative to the inflatable element, preparing it for deployment. [0005] One configuration includes an element capable of sliding along the device's length to position a stent adjacent to the inflatable element. Another includes a flexible carrier able to convey multiple stents, positioning them as required relative to the inflatable part. Furthermore, a dual-positioning system entails one element located distally to the inflatable part, and another placed ahead, with the possibility of accommodating several stents in a storage space. [0006] The stent delivery process involves positioning the stent adjacent to the inflatable element, followed by expansion, and finally, the deflation of the inflatable part, leaving the stent in place. This method can be repeated for different stents at various locations. [0007] The product also induces a method of placing a stent at desired vascular positions, involving the insertion of the device with the stents, navigation to the target area, stent repositioning, expansive deployment, and eventual deflation. ILLUSTRATIVE MODELS [0008] To aid in comprehending the system and its application, several exemplary models are presented with the following diagrams: [0009] FIG.1 exhibits a catheter according to one model; FIG.2 displays the same catheter equipped with stents; FIG.3-5 illustrate the catheter undertaking stent deployment in a vessel; Figures FIG.6-10 provide visual representations of an alternate model; FIG.11-13 detail the operation of another variant. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0010] Example I demonstrates a catheter equipped with a distal end, a proximal end, and a tube connecting an inflatable element for stent deployment. A sliding element is used to reposition stents along the tube, ensuring proper alignment with the inflatable area. [0011] Example II articulates an alternate catheter design with a cylindrical carrier for stents, which can move stents into position around the inflatable part. The stents can be deployed in any particular sequence chosen. [0012] Example III describes an improvement on the initial model, involving not only a posterior positioning element but also an anterior one, enabling versatile stent storage and deployment configurations.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention relates to catheters and more specifically to such catheters that are used to implant a stent in an artery. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Blood vessels, and particularly arteries, may become stenotic or occluded due to various atherosclerotic processes. A stenotic artery may be treated by balloon angioplasty in which an inflatable balloon mounted on a catheter tip is inserted into the arterial system and navigated through the arterial system to the diseased artery. The balloon is then inflated by means of a pressurized fluid. This causes the balloon to press radially on the arterial wall so as to open the stenosis. A stent may be crimped onto the balloon before insertion so that when the balloon is inflated the stent becomes expanded, The balloon is deflated and withdrawn leaving the expanded stent in the artery. These and other similar methods are well known to the skilled man of the art. [0003] It is often necessary to treat several stenoses in a single angioplastic session. For example, it may be necessary to insert a large diameter stent at one location, a small diameter stent at a second location and to perform a balloon angioplasty without a stent at a third location. This could be accomplished by sequential insertion and withdrawal of a catheter, the catheter being loaded each time with the appropriate stent prior to insertion. This however would cause much discomfort to the patient, prolongs the duration of the procedure and increases the chances of damaging a blood vessel. [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,519 discloses a catheter for deploying one or more stents. The stent has one or more individually expandable segments along its length. A stent, in its unexpanded states is loaded onto each expandable segment of the catheter. The catheter is inserted into the vascular system and positioned with the first expandable segment in a stenosis. An axial force is then applied to the segment causing it to buckle outwards and expand the stent. The force is then removed caused the segment to unbuckle leaving the stent in its expanded state. The catheter is then navigated to another stenosis. This process is repeated until all of the stents have been deployed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] The present invention provides a catheter for deploying one or more stents in a cardiovascular system. The catheter is configured to carry one or more stents. Preferably, the catheter carries a plurality of stents. The stents may be of different or the same widths. An inflatable balloon is used to expand a stent surrounding the balloon. The catheter comprises a positioner for moving a stent relative to the balloon from a position in which the stent does not surround the balloon to a position that it does surround the balloon in order to prime the stent for expansion by the balloon. The phrase \u201cfor moving a stent relative to the balloon\u201d includes two possibilities, i.e. moving the positioner relative to the balloon and moving the balloon relative to the positioner. [0006] In one embodiment of the invention the positioner comprises an element configured to slide along the catheter and push the stents distally along the catheter so as to move a stent adjacent to the balloon into a position in which it surrounds the balloon. The sliding element is pushed along the catheter by means of a wire extending along the catheter from its proximal end to the sliding element. In this embodiment, the stents are deployed in the order in which they are carried by the catheter, starting with the stent closest to the balloon. [0007] In another embodiment, the positioner comprises a flexible carriage configured to carry the one or more stents. The carriage is capable of sliding along the catheter in order to bring one of the stents from a position in which the stent does not surround the balloon to a position in which the stent surrounds the balloon. The carriage is moved in either direction along the catheter by means of a wire extending along the catheter from its proximal end to the carriage. It is also possible to position the stent opposite a desired location in the vascular system and slide the balloon through the carriage to a position opposite the stent. In this embodiment the stents may be deployed in the vascular system in any order. [0008] It a third embodiment, the catheter comprises two positioners, one posterior positioner as described above in the first embodiment positioned posterior to the balloon, and a second anterior positioner positioned anterior to the balloon. In this embodiment, the anterior positioner may be distanced from the balloon so as to provide a storage space between the anterior positioner and the balloon. The balloon in this embodiment may be a conventional balloon used in balloon angioplasty. In this embodiment also, the stents may be deployed in the vascular system in any order, and may be of different lengths. [0009] In use, the catheter is loaded with one or more stents and inserted into a vascular system. The catheter is navigated through the vascular system until the balloon or stent is positioned at a first desired location, typically the site of a stenosis. The stent or balloon is then moved by the positioner so that the stent surrounds the balloon and the balloon is inflated so as to expand the stent. The balloon is then deflated, leaving the expanded stent at the fist desired location. This process may be repeated, each time deploying a different stent at a different location. After one or more of the stents have been deployed, the catheter may be removed from the vascular system. [0010] The invention also provides a method for deploying a stent in a desired location of a vascular system comprising the steps of: [0011] (a) inserting a catheter according to the invention carrying one or more stents into the vascular system, [0012] (b) navigating the catheter through the vascular system until the balloon is positioned in the desired location; [0013] (c) moving a stent from a first position in which it does not surround the balloon to a second position in which it surrounds the balloon; [0014] (d) inflating the balloon so as to expand the stent; and [0015] (e) deflating the balloon.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Example I [0030] [0030]FIG. 1 shows a catheter 100 for deploying stents in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The catheter 100 has a distal end 108 and a proximal end 120. The catheter 100 comprises a flexible tube 102 , which is connected to an inflatable balloon 104 proximate to its distal end. The balloon 104 is shown in the Figure in its deflated state. A radio-opaque marker 118 is located on the balloon wall. The catheter 100 has at its distal end 108 a tapered tip 110 that may be inserted into a stenosis in order to open the stenosis. A syringe 130 may be used to introduce a fluid into the tube 102 in order to inflate the balloon 104 as described in detail below. [0031] A longitudinal shaft 124 in the wall of the tube 102 is configured to receive a guidewire 126 used in navigating the catheter in the vascular system. A neck region 122 of the tube 102 intervenes between the distal end of the balloon 104 and the tip 110. The proximal end of the tip 110 is broadened to form a shoulder at the distal end of the neck region 122. A sliding positioner element in the form of an annular sliding ring 114 is mounted on the tube 102 proximal to the balloon 104. The ring 114 is slidable along the tube 102 by means of a wire 116 that extends along the length of the tube 102 from the proximal end 120 of the catheter to the ring 114. [0032] The sliding ring 114 and the wire 116 form a positioner for moving a stent from a position which it does not surround the balloon 104 to a position in which it surrounds the balloon 104. [0033] [0033]FIG. 2 shows the catheter 100 having a plurality of stents (three are shown in FIG. 2) 206 a , 206 b and 206 c , mounted on the tube 102 between the sliding ring 114 and the balloon 104. The stents are separated from each other by separating rings 208 a and 208 b. The sliding ring 114 has been positioned so that the separating rings 208 a and 208 b and the stent 206 are contiguous with the balloon 104. Each stent 206 bears a radio-opaque markers 210 a , 210 b and 210 c. [0034] In use, the catheter 100 is introduced into the vascular system and navigated to a stenosis by methods well known in the art. FIG. 3 shows the catheter 100 after having been navigated through the vascular system and positioned inside a blood vessel 202. The balloon is located opposite a stenotic region 204 of the blood vessel 202. The wire 116 is used to slide the sliding ring 114 distally along the tube 102 so as to push the stents 206 a , 206 b , 206 c , distally. The sliding ring 114 is pushed distally along the tube 102 so that the stent 206 a is pushed over and around the balloon 104 , which is thereby brought into the lumen of the stent 206 a , and the marker 118 on the balloon coincides with the marker 210 a of the stent, as determined for example by x-ray angiography. FIG. 4 shows the stent 206 a surrounding the balloon 104. [0035] A fluid is then introduced into the tube 102. The fluid passes through the tube 102 and inflates the balloon 104. It will be understood that the balloon may be inflated by other conventional means, as are known in the art. Inflation of the balloon 104 expands the stent 206 a onto the stenotic region of the blood vessel 202 , as shown in FIG. 5. [0036] The fluid is then withdrawn from the tube 102. Withdrawal of the fluid from the tube 102 causes the balloon to deflate. After deflation of the balloon, the stent 206 a remains in situ in its expanded state. [0037] The catheter may then be navigated through the arterial system until the catheter is positioned with the balloon 104 at another stenotic region of a blood vessel. The sliding ring is pushed distally by the wire 116 so that the succeeding stent 206 b overlies the balloon 104 and the marker 118 coincides with the marker 210 b on the stent 206 b. The distal separating ring 208 a is pushed along the tube 102 , beyond the balloon 104 to the neck region 122 of the tube, where the separating rings are stored. The shoulder of the tip 110 retains the separating rings on the neck region. This process may be repeated until some or all of the stents 206 have been deployed. The catheter is then removed from the body. Example II [0038] [0038]FIG. 6 shows a catheter 600 for deploying stents in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. The embodiment of FIG. 6 has many components in common with the embodiment of FIG. 1, and similar components are identified by the same reference numeral in both embodiments. [0039] The embodiment of FIG. 6 has a cylindrical carriage 605 mounted on the tube 102. The carriage has a plurality of annular depressions (three are shown in FIG. 6) 610 a , 610 b and 610 c configured to receive a stent as described below. The depressions 610 all have the same length A as indicated in FIG. 6, which is essentially equal to the length of the balloon 104. Between the depressions 610 are barriers 620 a and 620 b. The carriage 605 is made from an elastic material such as rubber. The carriage 605 is slidable along the tube 102 by means of a wire 116 that extends along the length of the tube 102 from the proximal end 120 of the catheter to the carriage 605. The carriage 605 and the wire 116 form a positioner for moving a stent from a position in which it does not surround the balloon 104 to a position in which it surrounds the balloon 104. [0040] [0040]FIG. 7 shows the catheter 600 having a plurality of stents (three are shown in FIG. 7) 206 a , 206 b and 206 c mounted on the annular depressions of the tube 102. The stents are separated from each other by the barriers 620 a and 620 b. In the present embodiment the stents are of different lengths. However, they may also be of the same length. Each stent 206 bears a radio-opaque annular marker 210 a , 210 b and 210 c. [0041] The catheter 600 is introduced into the vascular system and navigated to a stenosis by methods well known in the art. FIG. 8 shows the catheter 600 after having been navigated through the vascular system and positioned inside a blood vessel 202. The balloon is located within a stenotic region 204 of the blood vessel 202. The wire 116 is used to slide the cage 605 distally along the tube 102 so as to move the stents 206 distally. The carriage 605 is pushed distally along the tube 102 until the balloon 104 is brought into the lumen of the stent 206 a and the marker 118 on the tube coincides with the marker 210 a , as determined for example by x-ray angiography. In a similar manner, the balloon may be slid within the carriage until it is positioned opposite the stent. FIG. 9 shows the stent 206 a surrounding the balloon 104. [0042] A fluid is then introduced into the tube 102. The fluid passes through the tube 102 and inflates the balloon 104. Inflation of the tube 104 expands the portion of the carriage 605 surrounding the balloon 104 which in turn expands the stent 206 a onto the stenotic region of the blood vessel 202 , as shown in FIG. 10. [0043] The fluid is then withdrawn from the tube 102 into the syringe 130. Withdrawal of the fluid from the tube 102 causes the balloon to deflate. After deflation of the balloon, the stent 206 a remains in its expanded state. [0044] The catheter is then navigated through the arterial system until the catheter is positioned with the balloon 104 in another stenotic region of a blood vessel. The catheter is then pushed distally by the wire 116 so that the stent 206 b overlies the balloon 104 and the marker 118 coincides with the marker 210 b on the stent 206 b. In this embodiment, the stents may be deployed in any order. This process may be repeated until some or all of the stents 206 have been deployed. The catheter is then removed from the body. Example III [0045] This example illustrates an embodiment which is an improvement over the embodiment described in Example I. With reference to FIG. 11, there is shown a catheter 700 having a distal end 108 and a proximal end 120. As in FIG. 1, the catheter 700 comprises a flexible tube 102 , which is connected to an inflatable balloon 704 proximate to its distal end. A radio-opaque marker 118 is located on the balloon wall. The catheter 700 has at its distal end 108 a tapered tip 110 , but unlike in Example I, there is no neck region, and the tip is not enlarged. The balloon in this embodiment may be a conventional inflatable balloon used in balloon angioplasty. [0046] As in Example I, a guidewire 126 extends along the tube 102 , exiting at the distal end 108 of the catheter. An anterior positioner in the form of a perforated sphere 706 is fixed to the guidewire anterior to the balloon 704 , e.g. the guidewire passes through a bore channel extending through the sphere. The diameter of the sphere is slightly larger than the diameter of the retracted stents which are mounted on the catheter. The purpose of the sphere will be explained below. [0047] The catheter 700 has a sliding ring 114 (being the posterior positioner) and a plurality of stents (three are shown in FIG."

The deployment of the thermally reactive component is characterized by the transition of the shape memory alloy from a basic flexible structure to a sophisticated fixed geometry.

[0029] The described versions of the device can be considered as types of 'fusion frameworks.' These components, in their preparatory state, exhibit flexible linear forms that can be conveyed through the interior of various surgical instruments in a straight path. Heat induction at a localized zone initiates a controlled transformation of the shape memory alloy.

The enduring stability of these structures is maintained at normal physiological temperatures. [0035] Helical or coil-based formations with two or more matching helices may also be implemented. When such helical forms are thermally activated, they are poised to engage with the designated region in a symmetrical manner. [0037] A specific device component includes a thermally sensitive shape memory material that exhibits super-elasticity at human body temperatures. The transition temperature is adjusted below normal body temperature, favoring a malleable martensite state at cooler temperatures, and a defined shape when heated.

No. 60/980,667 filed Oct. 17, 2007. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003] The device and method relates to instrumentation for the mammalian spine and is particularly directed to a device for correction of degenerative, congenital, or traumatic deformity, and a method of placement of the device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] There is a need for a cage system capable of effecting rigid intervertebral fusion placed in a minimally invasive manner through a posterior-lateral approach without requiring laminectomy to effect placement. [0005] There is a need for a cage system that may be placed in a minimally invasive manner that is capable of effecting dynamic stabilization to intervertebral segments. [0006] There is a need for a cage fusion or dynamic stabilization device that may be placed into an intervertebral osteotomy through a posterior-lateral approach without utilization of a rigid tube access device. [0007] There is a need for a cage fusion type device that may be utilized in the cervical region through an anterior-lateral approach with a minimally invasive technique for placement that does not require the use of rigid tube placement instrumentation. [0008] There is a need for a cage fusion or dynamic stabilization device that may be placed at all spinal levels utilizing a minimally invasive technique for placement having small access requirements and instrumentation that is flexible in nature allowing for adaptation to anatomic and placement route variation. [0009] There is a need for a cage type fusion/stabilization device that can be placed between vertebral bodies with minimal disruption of endogenous structures, thus maximizing retention of endogenous structure and stability, with little or no disruption of the annular ligament. [0010] There is a need for a minimally invasive cage type device that may be placed utilizing a true lateral access technique with the cage device placed transversely across the vertebral bodies and without material disruption of muscular structures and without associated morbidity at the time of surgery. [0011] There is a need for a device that can effect dynamic stabilization between vertebral segments. [0012] There is a need for devices effecting dynamic stabilization between vertebral segments having adaptive structural capabilities that permit dynamic movement of a load axis mimicking the structural capabilities of a native intervertebral disc. [0013] There is a need for a dynamic stabilization device that has a capability of avoiding failure through design of redundant load carrying members. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0014] A thermally active member comprises a shape memory material. The method of placement of the thermally active member facilitates transition of shape memory material between a simple undefined geometry, such as a substantially linear shape, to a complex predetermined shape memory form, such as a coiled shape. The preferred complex geometry may be described as an intervertebral cage or cage fusion device. The device may be placed into a space surgically created between two vertebrae through an access channel that is less than one third of its final deployed cross sectional dimension. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0015] FIG. 1 demonstrates a device within a deployment catheter, with a pre-deployment portion shown in essentially linear form, and a post-deployment portion shown as transitioned to coiled form. [0016] FIGS. 2 A, 2 B, 2 C, 2 D demonstrate potential post-deployment shapes of the device including a level cylindrical form, a tapered conical form, and a lozenge shaped form. [0017] FIG. 3 demonstrates an embodiment comprising triple helix geometry, wherein three parallel helices are fused at their ends maintaining register between the three components through the deployment process. [0018] FIG. 3 B demonstrates a triple helix design undergoing deployment wherein the axis of the deploying device is parallel to the central axis of the deployment catheter [0019] FIG. 4 demonstrates a cross-section of the device within a deployment catheter, and showing the heat transition zone of the deployment catheter. [0020] FIG. 5 demonstrates the device fully deployed within a corresponding shaped osteotomy. [0021] FIG. 6 demonstrate the contrast in form between the device as a simple linear geometry at lower temperature ( FIG. 6A ) and the higher temperature \u201cshape memory\u201d complex geometry of the fully deployed device ( FIG. 6B ). [0022] FIG. 7 shows a cross section configuration showing a triple helix design having interdigitating wires, intended to minimize cross section size pre-deployment. [0023] FIG. 8 demonstrates an essentially cylindrical geometry of the device with compressible side wall segments allowing for slight compression of the device and dynamic motion between adjacent vertebral bodies. Those portions of the device oriented towards the superior and inferior end plates of the vertebral bodies are covered with a polymer section designed to enhance fusion probability and/or to sequester wear debris. [0024] FIG. 9 shows a sidewall of attenuated structure in a cage embodiment, with micro-formed slots in a helical component. The slots allow greater flexion of the structure for a given load in compression. [0025] FIG. 10 shows an embodiment where the final shape memory form of the device is laminated, having two essentially independent devices placed sequentially one inside the other with a common central axis. This arrangement permits utilization of a relatively light structural device that gains structural strength through redundancy. [0026] FIG. 11 shows the device having an outer surface for promotion of boney fusion to the inferior and superior vertebral bodies between which the device is deployed. [0027] FIG. 12 shows the helical element(s) of the device with a polymer coating. The coating may serve to inhibit creation of wear debris or serve to sequester accumulated wear debris thus precluding the opportunity for immune reaction to occur. [0028] FIG. 13 The device is shown deployed within a containment component which consists of a substantially impermeable membrane into which the device has been deployed. The impermeable membrane conforms to the shape of the surgically created osteotomy. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0029] The device of the preferred embodiments may be classified as a \u201ccage fusion\u201d type device. The device may comprise one or more structural components comprised of a shape memory material. [0030] In pre-deployment form, the device components exist as simple elements that are malleable and capable of adopting an essentially linear form 12. FIG. 1. This linear form, which may be similar to a length of malleable wire, is capable of being moved through a lumen of a catheter 14 , trocar, arthroscope, or similar deployment device in a linear progression. The deployment device may utilize the \u201cThermal Method\u201d of deployment described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20060030933 to effect an orderly, controlled and sequential transition between two states of a shape memory material. This controlled and sequential transition is preferred to occur by the application of heat to the device in a narrowly defined space 16. [0031] The transitioned final form FIG. 1 of the device 2 is realized in situ and is capable of adopting a myriad of complex three dimensional forms. The device as positioned for use in the spine is preferred to be a coiled structure, and may be helical in structure. Exemplary coiled structures are shown in FIG. 2. The device may be formed as a level cylinder 22 ( FIG. 2 A), a conic cylinder 24 ( FIG. 2 B), a lozenge shape 26 ( FIG. 2 C), and configured with a rectangular cross section 28 ( FIG. 2 D). As long as the final form is maintained at temperatures above the design transition temperature, the device will remain in its super-elastic austenite \u201cshape memory\u201d or determinate form with high strength structural capabilities. [0032] The device is constructed to maintain a super-elastic form at body temperature, and may assume this shape at slightly below body temperature. This final deployed form of the device has a shape and size that may be a cage type structure, with the cage providing a framework for support. The structural properties of the device, when maintained at temperatures at or above the transition temperature, which is preferred to be at, or slightly below, body temperature is able to correct or assist in correcting anatomic deformity between vertebral segments. The device can effect a rigid fusion between adjacent vertebral bodies, and is preferred to have a high degree of rigidity. [0033] A further embodiment of the device provides structural scaling of material and cross-sections, and allows for design of a device with a predictable degree of compressibility, and creation of a dynamic stabilization construct. This embodiment may function as a prosthetic disc accommodating a controlled degree of motion between vertebral bodies. The geometry of this embodiment is capable of motion in six planes, and can emulate mechanical characteristics of native disc structures. [0034] Parallel coiled or helical designs may be utilized. Two or more equivalent coils or helices possess the geometric property of deployment generally parallel to the central axis of a deployment means, such as a deployment lumen or catheter. The multiple parallel helices may be joined at proximal and/or distal ends, structurally maintaining register between the helices through the deployment process. A single helix structure may deploy tangentially across the central axis of the deployment catheter, and not yield a symmetric deployment process. A three parallel helix embodiment 34 allows for a fully structurally symmetric process of deployment, wherein the forces of transition between the three elements are radially balanced, yielding a geometric relationship that tends towards deployment parallel 32 to the catheters central axis. FIGS. 3 and 3B. [0035] A thermal element comprises a thermally active shape memory material having super-elastic properties at body temperature. The design transition temperature may be specified below body temperature, such as 2 to 3 degrees Celsius below body temperature of the vertebrate into which the device is placed. Currently available materials meeting desirable specifications are various alloys of nitinol or nitinol like alloys. Alloy composition may be adjusted, creating shape memory materials having super-elastic and shape set characteristics (austenite state) near body temperature, while retaining those shape characteristics at body temperature and higher temperatures. These alloys exist at lower temperatures in martensite state wherein the material is relatively malleable and has no shape set or super-elastic properties, the shape may be expressed as \u201cindeterminate\u201d at these temperatures. When the shape of the device is indeterminate, if a dynamic force is placed upon the device and the dynamic force changes the shape, the shape into which the device is changed is retained when the dynamic force is removed. This martensite state corresponds to the pre-deployment malleable form, or indeterminate form, of the device. In this state, the device may be linear, like a wire, and may be bent 42 or shaped like a wire. In a preferred embodiment, the wire may be shaped manually by a physician installing the device. FIG. 4. [0036] When heat is applied to the device, the device assumes its predetermined super-elastic austenite \u201cshape memory\u201d form with high strength structural capabilities 44. The device will retain this shape as long as the temperature is maintained above the predetermined temperature, which is preferred to be just below body temperature of the human or other vertebrate into which the device is to be positioned. When a dynamic force is not being actively applied to the device at this higher temperature, the device assumes and retains a predetermined shape, which may be summarily referred to as a determinate shape. The device is shown in various embodiments of determinate shape in the drawing Figures. [0037] In one embodiment, the device is a wire 40 having a substantially round cross section. The determinate form of the device is shape set to a coiled or helical form. FIG. 4. The wire is maintained at a temperature below M f (martensite final state) within the deployment catheter prior to placement 42. (At this temperature, the wire is readily formable with little force required to bend or shape the wire, and the wire may be pushed through a lumen of a flexible tube 46. The tip 49 of a catheter may be introduced to the depth of the cylindrical osteotomy. Heat is then introduced at the catheter tip, such as by the use of electrical resistance coils 48 , transitioning the shape of the memory material to its determinate shape 44 as it is exposed to heat and as it exits the tip of the catheter. The temperature environment proximal to the catheter tip is maintained below M f. Temperatures after the catheter tip are maintained at greater than A f (body temperature or slightly below). Transition to austenite form proceeds linearly along the length of the device in an antigrade fashion: distal to proximal. [0038] The device may be repositioned during the placement process by terminating heat introduction, and pulling the device in the opposite direction and into the catheter, where the temperature environment is less than M f. Stated otherwise, the transition process is reversed. [0039] The final shape set form of the device is designed to substantially match the geometry of the osteotomy 52 formed for its placement in a vertebral body 54 (or usually, two vertebral bodies. FIG. 5. As transition occurs to austenite form, the device occupies the void 56 of the osteotomy in a distal to proximal fashion. [0040] Geometric configurations of the device are not limited to simple cylindrical shapes. A specified final design shape may be reduced to a single or multiple linear components, and the device is amenable to placement utilizing the technique described herein. At a low temperature state the device has no intrinsic shape beyond its cross section and no super-elastic properties. The device at the low temperature state may be characterized as shape indeterminate or indefinite. In this temperature state, the shape of the device is indeterminate and may be formed into a linear shape having a cross section that is considerably smaller than the cross section of the deployed device. FIG. 6 A. It is preferred that the device is manually deformable at will to accommodate deployment. In sharp contrast to the low temperature state, in the higher temperature state the device has a specific size, shape, and super-elastic properties. This state of the device at the higher temperature is the \u201cshape memory\u201d or determinate form of the device. FIG. 6 B. As the device transitions between these two different temperature states, virtually any shape set final austenite form is attainable. Examples are shown in FIG. 2 C, 2 D, 2 E, 2 F, but these embodiments are by no means exhaustive of the possibilities. [0041] This process permits low temperature martensite states to be utilized having non-complex geometry, and simple linear or substantially linear shapes, like a wire. The cross-section shape of these elements may be of any imaginable design, and especially those which may be extruded. The structural cross-section may likewise be varied along the length of a component to meet varied structural requirements for different portions of the component in its final \u201cshape memory\u201d or determinate form. Cross section variation allows not only for the device to meet structural requirements in its final deployed \u201cshape memory\u201d or determinate form, but permits design of the individual helical elements in interdigitating configurations 72 , preferably yielding a small cross section of the device in its low temperature pre-deployment or indeterminate form. FIG. 7. [0042] The design of the device may be specifically tailored to meet structural requirements for dynamic stabilization. Portions of the device may be so designed to allow compression between vertebral bodies and a limited degree of rotation between vertebral bodies; an essentially cylindrical geometry device with bent side wall segments 82 is shown which accommodate limited motion between vertebral segments. FIG. 8. In this embodiment, the cross section of the individual members may remain consistent throughout the device. The selective bending at specified areas creates a condition of structural attenuation. [0043] Further, the device may be so designed that specified portions of the structure are attenuated to allow a controlled degree of deformation to occur. FIG. 9. This embodiment may utilize micro machining techniques to remove portions of the structure 92 , resulting in the formation of areas that undergo intended deformation in response to less force than the overall structure. These areas may be subject to relative ease of deformation in bending, twisting, compression or elongation when compared to the \u201cnormal\u201d structural portions of the device. The device may be configured such that there is a plurality of independent cylindrical components arranged in a concentric configuration. FIG. 10. This embodiment involves sequential placement of two or more \u201cdevices\u201d along a common central axis. One device is placed in the usual manner 102 ; a second is then placed inside the first 104 yielding an overall construct with structural properties greater than any of its individual components. In this embodiment, each successive cylindrical component contributes greater strength to the overall construct. Similar to the previously described embodiments this aspect of design may be adapted to multiple shapes, including a level cylinder, tapered conic form, or lozenge shape. This embodiment of the device as a laminated structure with each independent component placed sequentially permits use of a lighter structure for each of the separate cylindrical components, thereby permitting greater ease of deployment. Further, this design increases redundancy of structural elements allowing for smaller cross sections for each of the components and less consequence in the event of failure of any one or more structural elements. This embodiment as shown yields twice as many structural elements, since each complete circular element of the coil 102 , 104 is placed as a two layered system, as compared to a single layered system, such as that shown in FIG. 2. [0044] The surfaces of the fully deployed device may be machined to produce a textured surface 112 that may increase the probability of boney fusion occurring."

An optical system then captures an image of the affected vanes, and a set of image parameters is generated from this image. These measured parameters, which include dimensions associated with size, shape, and movement, are then quantitatively compared against a series of standard parameters derived from a baseline measurement. This comparison aims to assess changes in corneal curvature prompted by the air burst, indirectly allowing for estimations of ocular characteristics other than Intraocular Pressure.\n\n",
  "pos": "TECHINCAL FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates to a medical device. More particularly, embodiments relates to a method and a system for determining Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of an eye. BACKGROUND [0002] There are few non-contact and non-evasive Tonometers that utilize angle modulation of high frequency sound waves or light waves to determine the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of a human eye using either frequency or phase modulation. [0003] One of the limitations of aforementioned approaches is that the Intraocular Pressure parameter is intended to diagnose Glaucoma impairment but this need to be used in conjunction with other observations. Some of the other observations involved are based on image analysis of optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre loss in the retinal portion of the eye. On this context, it is preferable to integrate these measurements into single device in order to avoid usage of multiple devices. As indicated earlier the Tonometer exploits either sound or light waves which demands different sources and measuring techniques, whereas, an imaging requires other type of sources and components. This leads to not only in increased bill of materials for the device but also to aid making device more portable. [0004] Hence, there exists need to provide a system to integrate all measurement in a single device to reduce bill of materials for the device. Also, eliminate different sources and measuring techniques to measure IOP. SUMMARY [0005] The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome through the provision of a method and a system as described in the description. [0006] Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to a method to identify Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of an eye by blowing air onto an eye ball of the eye. The method comprises of placing a foil-flap support assembly between an imaging unit and the eye, wherein the foil-flap support assembly has a transparent stiff foil fixed to a support and plurality of movable flaps facing the eye is suspended from the support. Once the foil-flap support assembly is placed, air of predetermined amount of pressure is blown onto an eye ball of the eye through an air channel, wherein the air blown to the eye ball rebounds from the eye ball deflating the flaps of the foil-flap support assembly. At this stage an image of the deflated foil-flap support assembly is captured and plurality of parameters value of the captured image is calculated. Now, the calculated plurality of parameters value is compared with plurality of predetermined parameters value to identify IOP of the eye. [0007] A system to identify IOP of the eye is disclosed as another aspect of the present disclosure. The system comprises a foil-flap support assembly and a control unit. The foil-flop support assembly comprises a transparent stiff foil fixed to a support and plurality of movable flaps facing the eye is suspended from the support. The control unit comprises an imaging unit, a computing unit, a storage unit and a blowing unit. The blowing unit comprising an air channel is used to blow air of predetermined amount of pressure onto an eye ball of the eye. Thus, the blown air gets rebound deflating the flaps of the foil-flap support assembly. The imaging unit is used to capture image of the foil-flap support assembly before and after deflation of the flaps. The computing device is configured to identify plurality of parameters value of the captured image and to compare the identified parameters value with a predetermined parameters value to identify IOP of the eye. The predetermined parameters value is determined during a calibration. A storage unit is configured in the control unit to store the calibrated predetermined parameters value.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0021] The foregoing has broadly outlined the features and technical advantages of the present disclosure in order that the detailed description of the disclosure that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the disclosure. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present disclosure. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the disclosure, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present disclosure. [0022] The present disclosure relates to a method to identify Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of an eye by blowing air onto an eye ball of the eye. The method comprises of placing a foil-flap support assembly between an imaging unit and the eye, wherein the foil-flap support assembly has a transparent stiff foil fixed to a support and plurality of movable flaps facing the eye is suspended from the support. Once the foil-flap support assembly is placed, air of predetermined amount of pressure, which is in the range of 10 millimetre of Mercury (10 mmHg) to 100 millimetre of Mercury (100 mmHg), is blown onto an eye ball of the eye through an air channel. The blown air hits the eye ball. The blown air rebounds from the eye ball deflating the flaps of the foil-flap support assembly. At this stage an image of the deflated foil-flap support assembly is captured and plurality of parameters value of the captured image is calculated. The plurality of parameters value of the is selected from at least one of size, length, breadth, width, shape, lateral shifts, rotation, translation, scaling or any combinations thereof. Now, the calculated parameters value is compared with plurality of predetermined parameters value to identify IOP of the eye. [0023] The predetermined parameters value is determined from a normal eye by performing a calibration comprising steps of placing the foil-flap support assembly between the eye and the camera. At this stage, an image of the foil-flap support assembly is captured. The plurality of parameters value of the captured image is calculated. Now, air of the predetermined amount of pressure is blown onto an eye ball of the normal eye through the air channel. The air blown hits the eye ball and gets rebound from the eye ball which deflates the foil-flap support assembly. Now, the image of the deflated flaps of the foil-flap support assembly is captured. From the captured image, the plurality of parameters value of the deflated flaps is calculated. The calculated parameters value is stored. Later, the amounts of air pressure are varied and are blown to the eye ball of the normal eye. The images of the deflated flaps corresponding to varied amounts of air pressure are captured. The parameters value is calculated for each captured images and is stored. [0024] A system to identify IOP of the eye is disclosed as another aspect of the present disclosure. The system comprises a foil-flap support assembly and a control unit. The foil-flop support assembly comprises a transparent stiff foil fixed to a support and plurality of movable flaps facing the eye is flexibly suspended from the support. The transparent stiff foil and the plurality of movable flaps have a thickness in the range of 0.1 millimetre to 5.0 millimetre. Also, they have a predefined color or prerequisite pattern different from one another. The control unit comprises a blowing unit, a camera, a computing device and a storage unit. The air channel selected from at least one of a transparent tube and a non-transparent tube. The transparent tube is selected from at least one of a glass tube, plastic tube and rubber tube. The non-transparent tube is selected from at least one of plastic tube, rubber tube and metallic tube. The air channel is used to blow air of predetermined amount of pressure onto an eye ball of the eye. The air channel is placed at a distance of 30 millimetre to 40 millimetre from the eye. The blown air hits the eye ball and gets rebound from the eye ball deflating the flaps of the foil-flap support assembly. The control unit also includes an imaging unit used to capture image of the foil-flap support assembly before and after deflation of the flaps. The computing device is configured to identify plurality of parameters value of the captured image and to compare the identified parameters value with a predetermined parameters value to identify IOP of the eye. The predetermined parameters value is determined during a calibration. The storage unit is configured in the control unit to store the calibrated predetermined parameters value. [0025] FIG. 1A shows a system to identify IOP of the eye according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The system has a foil-flap support assembly 112 and a control unit 102. The foil-flap assembly have a transparent stiff foil 118 fixed to a support 114 and plurality of movable flaps 116 facing an eye is flexibly suspended from the support 114. The transparent stiff foil 118 and the plurality of movable flaps 116 have a thickness in the range of 0.1 millimetre to 5.0 millimetre. Also, the transparent stiff foil 118 and the plurality of movable flaps 116 have a predefined color or prerequisite pattern different from one another. The control unit 102 comprises a blowing unit 110 , a imaging unit 106 , a computing unit 104 and a storage unit 108. The blowing unit 110 has an air channel 120 to blow air of predetermined amount of pressure onto an eye ball 122 of the eye. The air channel 120 is placed such a way that it impinges air on the eye ball 122 and do not block rebound air that deflates the suspended flaps 116. In an embodiment, the air channel 120 comprises a nozzle with one or more openings. The opening of the air channel 120 can be of any shape including but not limited to circle, oval etc. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more sensors can be placed between or around the opening to measure the reflected air pressure. The imaging unit 106 is used to capture image of the foil-flap support assembly 112 before (in calibration) and after deflation. The computing device 104 is configured to identify plurality of parameters value of the captured image and to compare the identified parameters value with a predetermined parameters value which is determined during a calibration to identify IOP of the eye. The storage unit 108 is used to store calibrated parameters value. [0026] FIG. 1B shows arrangement of various components of an assembly 112 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A black or any specific colored definite fringe pattern on the transparent material labelled 118 is rigidly fixed to the support 114. Further, two or more flaps 116 with another definite fringe pattern like moir\u00e9 pattern or any other definite pattern is flexibly suspended from the support 114 that gets deflated as rebound air hits on them. This assembly 112 is placed between the imaging unit 106 and the eye such that the images of the combined fringe pattern can be captured without air puffing and while is puffed. As the rebound air falls on the suspended flaps 116 could either moved laterally apart from each other or could be made moved front to back direction. Both the described movements will change the parameters value such as breadth, length and lateral shifts. This change in parameters value is directly proportional to rebound air pressure. [0027] FIG. 2A illustrates a method to identify Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of an eye according to an embodiment of present disclosure. The method comprises acts of placing a foil-flap support assembly 112 between the eye and a imaging unit 106 at step 202 , wherein the foil-flap support assembly has a transparent stiff foil 118 fixed to a support 114 and plurality of movable flaps 116 facing the eye is suspended from the support 114. At step 204 the air of predetermined amount of pressure i.e. of 20 millimetre of Mercury (20 mmHg) is blown onto an eye ball 122 of the eye through an air channel 120. The air blown to the eye ball 122 gets rebound from the eye ball 122 deflating the flaps 116 of the assembly 112. At step 206 an image of the deflated flaps 116 of the foil-flap support assembly 112 is captured by the imaging unit 106. The plurality of parameters value of the captured image is identified at step 208 by a computing unit 104. For example, in FIG. 2B , the length of the deflated flaps is labelled as l e and breadth of the flaps labelled as b e are identified at step 208. At step 110 , the identified parameters value is compared with plurality of predetermined parameters value to identify IOP of the eye. [0028] FIG. 3A shows an outwardly bulged lens surface of the eye ball 122 when IOP is high according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. If the IOP is high, then the internal surface pressure is high that makes the lens surface bulged and inflexible or stiff as shown in FIG. 3A. When the air of 20 mmHg is blown on such surface, the air is outwardly rebounded from the eye ball 122 is less that depends on a surface curvature of the lens surface of the eye ball 122 of the eye which is usually bulged as shown. This makes the flexible flaps 116 to get less deflated and consequently there will be less change in parameters values. [0029] FIG. 3B shows a flat or inwardly dented lens surface of the eye ball 122 when IOP is low according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. When the air at pressure of 20 mmHg is blown to the lens of the eye ball 122 having little or low IOP, the lens surface is flexible enough that allows external corneal surface of lens to become flat or dented inside. Further, the rebound air pressure is oriented in the direction of the flaps 116 would be more as shown in FIG. 3B. [0030] FIG. 4A illustrates a method of performing a calibration to determine predetermined parameters value from a normal eye according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A foil-flap support assembly 112 is placed between the eye and the imaging unit 106 at step 402. At step 404 , an image of the foil-flap support assembly 112 before the air is blown is captured using the imaging unit 106. The parameters values of the flaps 116 i.e. l and b as shown in FIG. 4B which are the length and breadth of the flaps before air is blown are identified at step 406. At step 408 , air of \u2018K\u2019 mmHg amount of pressure is blown onto the eye ball 122. This causes the flaps 116 to get deflated since air blown gets rebound from the eye ball 122. The imaging unit 106 captures the image of the deflated flaps at step 410."

  "negative": "The invention pertains to a novel garment for use by individuals engaged in elevated operations. The garment includes several flexible components that encircle distinct sections of the user's body, with certain components integrating a connection unit. A span extends between the connection units of multiple components, positioned over a user's torso. A linkage mechanism linked to the span bears a portion of the user's weight and conveys it to a stabilizing element. The linkage assembly features a coupling unit that can traverse along the span, loading it at intervals. While the span is a flexible item designed to withstand tension, it could take various shapes, being crafted from materials such as cords or strips. The coupling might distribute the burden along a span length corresponding to a significant fraction of the user's dimensions. For instance, the coupling could stretch its loading effect across a breadth ranging from 100mm to 500mm. The concept emphasizes comfort enhancement while retaining the garment\u2019s pliability without necessitating an elongated, stiffly fitted component.\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0001] Field of the Invention [0002] This invention relates to harnesses. Specifically, it relates to harnesses that are intended for use by a person at height, such as a climber or a person working at height. [0003] Users who work at height may spend many hours at a time in a harness to perform work tasks on structures, buildings and trees. A typical user will wear an industrial climbing harness and be attached to a climbing system to enable them to position themselves in a location to perform the work tasks required. The harness must not only provide comfortable and safe support for the user, it must also allow the user freedom of movement to climb and maneuver themselves within their working environment. [0004] A commercial user may spend many hours at a time in a harness when working in this way. Therefore, any potential source of discomfort in the harness is likely to lead to actual discomfort over time, which may ultimately lead to a reduction in the time a user can spend working in the harness. It is therefore in both the interest of productivity and of the welfare of the user to ensure that potential sources of discomfort in a work harness are, so far as is possible, minimized. [0005] In general, any part of the harness which is likely to cause a localized increase in the pressure applied to a user&#39;s body is a potential source of discomfort, and it is recognized that steps should be taken in designing a harness to avoid any potential source of raised pressure. [0006] Summary of the Prior Art [0007] One approach to solving this problem is to provide a rigid or semi-rigid platform that acts as a seat to provide the primary support for a user&#39;s weight. For example, this arrangement can be seen in US-A-2009/314578. Comfort may potentially be further improved by providing a bosun&#39;s chair arrangement that provides a broad and potentially cushioned sitting platform. However, the presence of a rigid structure in both of these arrangements can restrict a user&#39;s freedom of movement, and can be unwieldy when working in a partially-obstructed space, such as amongst branches of a tree canopy or maneuvering through a manhole. Therefore, many users still prefer a fabric harness made of flexible material including ropes and webbing. [0008] To place the invention in context, a known harness to which it might be applied is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The main components of such a harness include a waist belt 10 , leg loops 12 , a bridge 14 , an attachment eye 16 , top Ds 18 and forward Ds 20. The bridge 14 , which in this example is a length of fabric rope, extends between eyes on the respective forward Ds and the attachment eye 16 surrounds and can slide along the bridge 14. [0009] For use, a user is secured within the harness with the waist belt 10 around their waist, and with each leg loop 12 surrounding a respective one of the user&#39;s thighs. In this position, each forward D 20 lies to the outside of the user&#39;s leg 26. A climbing rope 28 is connected to the attachment eye 16 , typically by way of a carabiner, to carry the user&#39;s weight through the leg loops 12. The attachment eye 16 can float along and pivots upon the bridge 14 when the user moves from side to side. This gives the user unrestricted movement and means the harness adapts to the users shape when they twist, pivot and move, which is considered by users to be a particular advantage of this type of harness. [0010] A problem arises with this arrangement because the bridge 14 extends in two lengths from the attachment eye 16 , so that the force applied to each of the forward Ds 20 has an inward component F i that is directed towards the other of the forward Ds 20 as well as a force F o that acts away from the user. This is shown diagrammatically in FIG. 3A. Such harnesses are wrapped around a user, with a U-shaped rear part applying the load to the user. When loaded from the ventral attachment point, the harness compresses the width of the loaded U shape, reducing the loaded contact area and compressing the body of the user. This inward component can result in localized pressure, and possible discomfort after long-term use. Therefore, known harnesses put stress and pressure on the user due to constricting the user&#39;s hips, legs and buttock area when under load due to the single attachment eye point which is of limited width. One attempted solution is to add a seat to the rear of the harness, as illustrated in FIG. 3B , however there is still discomfort because of the rigid nature of the seat. Moreover, harness seats are cumbersome and can restrict the movement and rope positioning ability of the user due to the position behind the legs and rigid nature of the seat. [0011] An improvement to this type of harness is disclosed in EP-A-2 781 235. This proposes making a rigid interconnection between what is called here the forward Ds. However, this requires an extended, rigid component to be connected to the harness, which can restrict a user&#39;s freedom of movement and which removes some of the flexibility that is appreciated in this type of harness. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0012] An aim of this invention is to avoid or reduce this potential disadvantage without compromising the flexibility of this type of harness. [0013] To this end, from a first aspect, this invention provides a harness for use by a person at height comprising: a plurality of flexible harness elements, each of which, when in use, encircles part of a user&#39;s body, wherein some or all of the harness elements include a connection piece; a bridge extending between a respective connection piece of two or more harness elements, the bridge extending across a part of a user&#39;s body; connection means connected to the bridge to convey at least part of a user&#39;s weight from the harness to a support element; wherein: the connection means has coupling means that at least partially surrounds and that can move along the bridge and is capable of loading the bridge at spaced-apart locations. [0018] The aim of improving comfort is thereby achieved, without the need to provide any elongate, rigidly-attached component, and thereby maintain the flexibility of the harness. [0019] The bridge is typically an elongate flexible component, intended to be loaded under tension. It may take a wide variety of forms, being, for example, formed from rope (wire or textile), webbing, cable, or otherwise. [0020] The coupling means may be capable of distributing load along a length of the bridge that is a substantial proportion of the dimension of a user&#39;s body that is spanned by the bridge: that is to say, it may exceed 10%, 20%, 25%, 50% or 100% of that dimension. For example, where the bridge extends across a user&#39;s trunk or hips, the coupling means may spread its load over a distance in the range of 100 mm to 500 mm or more. [0021] For example, the coupling means may have a tubular body through which the bridge extends. In such a case, the load is spaced apart on the bridge by the length of the tubular body. Alternatively, the coupling means may have a plurality of spaced guides through which the bridge passes. In such a case, the load is spaced apart on the bridge by the distance between the guides. The bridge makes sliding or rolling contact with the body while the harness is in use, which can cause parts of the body to wear over time. Therefore, it may be advantageous for those parts of the body with which the bridge makes contact may be formed as separate components that can be removed and replaced independently of other parts of the harness. Advantageously, each of these components may be configured such that it can be connected to the coupling means in a plurality of orientations such that if excessive wear occurs at one part of the component, it can be removed from the body and re-installed in a different orientation, whereby an unworn part of the component makes contact with the bridge. [0022] In some embodiments of the invention, the coupling means is capable of loading the bridge at spaced-apart locations when in a first configuration, and in a second configuration, loads the bridge at closely-spaced locations. This allows a user to choose between maximizing comfort and maximizing freedom of movement. For example, such embodiments (or others) may have loading components, such as loading arms, each of which carries a loading element, the distance between the loading elements determining the extent to which the load is spaced along the bridge. These loading components may be mutually movable (e.g., by pivoting, sliding, screwing, or moving telescopically) to adjust the spacing between the loading elements. [0023] In these embodiments, due to the large loads apparent on the spaced-apart locations, a load-limiting means may be provided to enable the device to break non-catastrophically in the event that the load exceeds a safe threshold. The load-limiting means may include a breaker bolt or breaker link that will fail at a predetermined force to return to the second, closely-spaced and thus stronger configuration to enable a non-catastrophic collapse of the device. This may give the user the ability to carry on using the device in the closed position whilst being rescued or performing self-rescue. Thus, when in the first configuration, a load on the bridge exceeds a threshold, the loading components are caused to move towards their second configuration. [0024] The connection means typically includes linking means that can be used to link the connection means to an external component, such as a carabiner or a sling. Most advantageously, the connection means permits pivotal movement between the connection means and the external component. Such pivotal movement is preferably permitted about more than one axis. Such axes are preferably normal to and parallel to the bridge in the region of the connecting means. [0025] Preferably, contact between the bridge and the connection means is made through components configured to minimize friction and/or abrasion with the bridge. For example, contact between the bridge and the connection means may be made through rolling elements or through smooth and/or curved surfaces. [0026] The support element is typically a climbing line. [0027] Embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail, by way of example, and with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0043] With reference to the drawings, an embodiment of the invention is a modification of the harness of FIGS. 1 and 2 and should be assumed to include all of the components of that harness. This embodiment comprises all of the components of that harness, with the exception of the attachment eye 16 , which is replaced by a load-spreading assembly, as will now be described. [0044] The load-spreading assembly comprises a tubular body 30 which, in this embodiment, is formed from light alloy by forging, machining and/or casting. The body has a central, cylindrical passage 32 that extends lengthways, parallel to a long axis A, through it. End portions 34 of the cylindrical passage 32 are radiused, so as to present no sharp edges and reduce frictional forces in movement at the ends of the passage 32. The length of the passage in this embodiment is approximately 120 mm, but this may be varied to accommodate users of different sizes and a range of applications and working environments. [0045] Centrally along the length of the body there is an attachment point. The attachment point comprises a swivel connector 40 and two flange portions 42 of the body 30. [0046] The flange portions 42 have facing surfaces that are spaced apart and parallel to one another to opposite sides of the axis A. Centrally, an aperture is formed through each flange portion 42 , these apertures being coaxial and transverse to the axis A. In the region of the flange portions 42 , the passage 32 is open in a direction radially of the axis; however, this is for convenience of manufacture, and is not an essential feature of embodiments of this invention. [0047] The swivel connector 40 comprises a boss 46 and an eye 50 , these being interconnected for free mutual rotation about a swivel axis B. The boss 46 has spaced parallel surfaces, and an aperture that extends through the boss between them (not shown). A pivot bolt 52 passes through the apertures in the flange portions 42 and the boss 46 and is retained by a nut 54 recessed into one of the flange portions 42. This allows the boss 46 , and therefore the entire swivel connector 40 , to pivot about a pivot axis C that is coaxial with the pivot bolt 52 , as shown in FIG. 8. [0048] In use, the bridge 14 of the harness passes through the cylindrical passage 32. A climbing rope is connected to the swivel connector, typically through a carabiner that passes through the eye 50. As with the conventional harness, the position of the climbing rope can pivot and float with respect to the bridge by: [0049] the tubular body 30 sliding along the bridge 14 , free sliding being ensured by the provision of the radiused end portions 34 ; [0050] the swivel connector 40 pivoting with respect to the body 30 about the axis C; and [0051] the eye 50 pivoting with respect to the boss 46 , and therefore the body 30 , about the swivel axis B. [0052] This allows a similar freedom of movement as does a conventional harness. [0053] As can be seen by comparing FIGS. 9 and 3 , the effect of this invention is that the component of the force in the bridge 14 that is resolved into an inwardly-directed force F i is reduced, and that the end potions of the bridge, which extend from the forward Ds 20 , are held at an angle which causes less or no compression to the user&#39;s legs. The effect of this is to lessen pressure that is applied to a user&#39;s body during use of the harness, and thereby reduce the likelihood that it will cause discomfort. [0054] An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in FIGS. 10, 11 and 12. This embodiment includes a swivel connector 40 essentially the same as that described above. [0055] In this embodiment, first and second arms 60 , 70 are pivotally connected by a pivot bolt 62 and nut 64 to the boss 46 such that each arm 60 , 70 can pivot against a respective one of the spaced parallel surfaces of the boss 46. Remote from the pivot bolt 62 , the arms fork, whereby a passage 66 through each arm is defined in a direction normal to the pivot axis C. Each passage 66 is closed by a cross-piece 68 of circular cross-section that extends across the fork parallel to the pivot axis C. A transverse bore 72 extends through the second arm 70 parallel to and close to the pivot bolt. Two bores 74 , 76 extend through the first arm 60 parallel to and close to the pivot bolt. [0056] The arms 60 , 70 can be disposed in a closed position ( FIG. 10 ) in which they are pivoted together about the pivot bolt 62 to reduce to a minimum the distance between the passages 66. In this position, the bore 72 of the second arm is in alignment with one of the bores 74 in the first arm 60 , and a pin can be inserted into these bores 72 , 74 to secure the arms 60 , 70 in that position. Alternatively, the arms 60 , 70 can be disposed in an open position ( FIG."

  "negative": "The present technology pertains to an advanced pump mechanism structured to transfer a range of sensitive or robust liquids, specifically a pump composed of an exterior shell that surrounds a rotor. The exterior shell is configured to be discarded after use, while the rotor is built for repeated uses, showcasing economical and environmental advantages. The pump technology is tailored to operate without traditional bearings and seals, relying instead on hydrodynamic forces to sustain the rotor during its operation. This approach is particularly useful for handling delicate liquids that could be compromised by conventional pumps, such as certain industrial solvents. Just as fluids unmarred by external or shearing impact forces can benefit from this pump design, robust liquids that may corrode or pollute the inner workings of a standard pump also stand to gain from its innovative features. The pump makes use of a rotor that remains unaffected by bearings and seals, achieving dynamic equilibrium through hydrodynamic and buoyant forces. Despite the absence of a direct connection between the rotor and the shell, the design ensures ease of assembly. Furthermore, the rotor's design allows for the incorporation of electromagnets without compromising the durability to withstand cleaning procedures, employing a variety of matrices and composites, making the pump versatile for transferring a diverse spectrum of industrial solvents. In use, the shell can be separated into segments to release the rotor for subsequent purification and sanitization processes. After which, the cleaned rotor is inserted into a new shell unit, with the components of the shell designed to be attached securely through bonding or adhesion techniques.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to an improved pump for transferring fragile or aggressive fluids, and more particularly to a pump comprising a housing enclosing an impeller, and wherein the housing component is disposable, and with the impeller component being designed for reuse. The present invention is a modification of the pumps disclosed and claimed in my U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,685,700, 5,924,848, 5,938,412, and 6,106,659, and each of which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. [0002] The pump structures of the present invention are designed to be bearing and seal-free, and with hydrodynamic forces supporting the impeller during operation. As such, these pumps are particularly well adapted for applications dealing with fragile fluids, including human or animal blood. Neither of these can tolerate exposure to forces such as unusual impact and/or sheer forces, and thus the advantages of utilizing bearing and seal-free pumps become apparent. Aggressive fluids include corrosive or poisonous fluids, as well as fluids which cannot tolerate contamination, or which otherwise may destroy seals and/or bearings to reduce the lifetime and/or longevity of the pump structure. Poisonous fluids, for example, are extremely dangerous when a leak develops, a common consequence of bearing failure. The pump of the present invention utilizes an impeller which is bearing and seal-free, being dynamically balanced during operation by a combination of hydrodynamic and buoyant forces. The pump of the present invention is particularly adapted for transferring human blood and is capable of creating a flow of such liquids without damaging and/or otherwise significantly adversely affecting the quality of the pumped fluid. Inasmuch as the impeller or rotor is reusable, it is economically sound practice to fabricate this component of materials which may be costly, or alternatively, of materials which may present problems in fabrication due to their physical, chemical, and/or mechanical properties. Metals such as titanium and non-metals such as pyrolytic carbon and certain engineered plastics are examples of such materials. [0003] Another feature of the impeller or rotor is that it be capable of receiving and reliably retaining electromagnetic components used in the drive system and capable of withstanding the cleaning operations, with such an array of permanent magnets being readily disposed within the rotor in a brushless motor configuration. Alternatively, permanent magnet-to-permanent magnet couplings may be employed and mounted in a similar fashion. Thus, the arrangement of the present invention provides for the economic utilization of a rotor which may be costly to fabricate initially, but because of its versatility and reusability, these rotors become highly economically viable. [0004] In a typical application, any given assembly of the pump of the present invention and its associated structure is designed for single use only. In pumps of the present invention, following any given single use or application, the housing is separated into two or more parts, thereby freeing the rotor for subsequent cleaning and sterilization operations. Following the completion of the cleaning and sterilization operations, the rotor may be installed in a fresh housing. Housings of the present invention are provided with mating circumferential surfaces which are well adapted to be sealed together by means of adhesive and/or fusion bonding. The design of the pump of the present invention is such that housing tolerances are loose enough to provide for ease of assembly, with wide interchangeability of rotors being, of course, accommodated. Ease of reassembly is enhanced by virtue of the fact that the impeller or rotor is not attached physically to the housing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] In accordance with the present invention, a bearing and seal-free pump is provided comprising a housing which forms an operative enclosure about a hydrodynamically stable impeller or rotor. Means are provided for imparting rotational motion to the impeller, which is accordingly positioned within the chamber within the housing. Appropriate inlet and outlet ports are provided for accomplishing transfer of the fluid through the pump structure. [0006] Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved bearing and seal-free pump comprising a housing forming an enclosed pumping chamber in which a rotor is disposed. Being bearing and seal-free, relatively wide manufacturing tolerances may be accommodated, with the housing and rotor components being fabricated of appropriately selected materials. Inasmuch as the rotor is designed to be reusable, a wider variety of materials may be included in the list of suitable materials. [0007] It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide an improved bearing and seal-free pump structure which has a configuration designed for ease of assembly and disassembly, thereby enhancing the utility of the system. [0008] Other and further objects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a study of the following specification, appended claims, and accompanying drawings. IN THE DRAWINGS [0009] [0009]FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the exterior of a pump assembly prepared in accordance with the present invention; [0010] [0010]FIG. 2 is a vertical sectional view taken through the axis of the structure as illustrated in FIG. 1, and illustrating the flow pattern created by the pump when in actual operation; [0011] [0011]FIG. 3 is a detail fragmentary view of that portion of the housing which is adapted for sealing following introduction of the rotor into the pump chamber; [0012] [0012]FIG. 4 is a horizontal sectional view of the pump structure illustrated in FIG. 1, and showing the detail of the flow pattern of the pump during operation; [0013] [0013]FIG. 5 is a vertical sectional view taken through the axis of a modified form of pump, and illustrating the flow pattern created during actual operation; and [0014] [0014]FIG. 6 is a horizontal sectional view of the pump structure illustrated in FIG. 5, and being taken along the line and in the direction of the arrows 6 - 6 of FIG. 5. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0015] In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, and with particular attention being directed to FIGS. 1, 2 and 4 of the drawings, the pump generally designated 10 comprises a housing 11 , the interior of which defines pumping chamber 12. As will be discussed in detail hereinafter, housing 11 comprises a pair of mating components sealed together about the annular wall portions defining the perimeter. By separating the housing 11 , the rotor may be removed, cleaned and sterilized, and installed in a fresh housing. [0016] The inner periphery 13 of housing 11 forms the outer periphery of the chamber 12. As is clear from the views of FIGS. 2 and 4, housing 11 and chamber 12 share a central axis which extends along axis 14 as set forth in FIG. 2. Housing 11 , and accordingly chamber 12 , is provided with a pair of inlet ports as at 16 and 17 , along with outlet ports as at 18 and 19. Inlet ports 16 and 17 , collectively, define the inlets to the chamber, while outlet ports 18 and 19 collectively define the outlets. The inlet ports 16 and 17 are arranged coaxially with the chamber, that is, along axis 14 , with the inlet ports being arranged in oppositely disposed relationship to chamber 12. Outlet ports 18 and 19 are arranged medially of the inlet ports, and are, as indicated, disposed generally transversely of axis 14. [0017] With continued attention being directed to FIGS. 2 and 4 of the drawings, rotor 20 is disposed within chamber 12 and has a symmetrical dual conical configuration. This configuration provides dual cones converging toward opposed polar regions such as 21 and 22 , and the rotor is provided with an axis of rotation which extends between the polar regions 21 and 22. The base of each of the two cones forming the dual cone configuration are coupled together and form a common center plane. This common center is further utilized as a mounting base for a plurality of permanent magnets such as magnets 24 - 24. These magnets are arranged at radially spaced locations generally medially along the axis of rotation of rotor 20 , with the permanent magnets being provided at equally radially and arcuately spaced locations. Electromagnetic drive means are provided as at 26 - 26 and 27 - 27 , with the electromagnetic drive means being, in turn, coupled to a source of electrical energy and arranged to deliver rotational driving energy to the rotor through the permanent magnets 24 - 24. The drive arrangement is, of course, commonly referred to as a brushless motor configuration and brushless motor drives are, of course, well known in the art. The rate of rotation of rotor 20 is conveniently controlled by means of the frequency of the field applied to electromagnetic members 26 - 26 and 27 - 27 , with the rate of rotation being controlled by the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field, or by selective energization of the electromagnetic means 26 - 26 and 27 - 27. Such drives are, of course, commonly utilized and well known in the art. [0018] In the pump assembly of FIGS. 5 and 6, the pump 35 includes a pumping chamber with a central axis 36 , and with a rotor body 37 being disposed within the chamber for bearing and seal-free rotation therewithin. The pump structure of FIG. 5 is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,848 referred to hereinabove. The rotor 37 has a double or dual-conical configuration which converges toward opposed polar regions, and with the axis of rotation extending between these polar regions. Rotor 37 is further provided with radial vanes 38 - 38 extending radially outwardly relative to the axis of rotation. These vanes are utilized to enhance flow, as well as to provide a zone for encapsulation of magnetic drive components 39 - 39. Magnetic drive components 39 are typically arranged symmetrically in axially spaced apart relationship relative to the transverse axis of the rotor. Fluid inlet ports 41 and 42. are arranged in the pumping chamber in oppositely disposed relationship within the chamber 43 , with the fluid being transported or transferred to the inlet port area either externally or internally of the chamber. Except for those occasions when the rotor is displaced, it is normally arranged in coaxial relationship with both the pumping chamber and the fluid inlet ports. The outlet port or ports 44 are arranged generally medially of the chamber, midway between the inlet ports and typically are positioned tangentially of the medial portion of the pumping chamber. In those situations where the axis of rotation of the rotor is arranged along a vertical axis, the dual-conical configuration is such that flow on the outside portion of the rotor proceeds downwardly on the upper portion, and upwardly on the lower portion of the dual-cone rotor. See arrows indicating flow. The Housing [0019] Housing generally designated 50 comprises two segments including segment 51 and segment 52. These segments are joined and bonded together at seal 53. Seal 53 is utilized to bond the segments 51 and 52 together, and may be undertaken by conventional secure bonding techniques. Examples of suitable techniques include fusion bonding as well as bonding with highly durable and acceptable adhesives. Such secure bonding techniques including the use of suitable adhesives are known to those of skill in the art. [0020] When a pump assembly has been utilized for a particular application, and need for sterility is required before a subsequent use, housing or shell 50 is separated at the seal zone 53 , or other suitable location. When separated, rotor or impeller 37 is removed and separately subjected to a sterilization operation such as thermally or through exposure to a sterilizing atmosphere such as ethylene oxide or the like, the sterilization following, of course, a thorough cleansing operation. Thereafter, impeller 37 is reintroduced into a fresh housing or shell 50 including fresh segments 51 and 52 , whereupon the bonding operation is undertaken to render the assembly fully useful. [0021] With respect to the areas of the inlet and outlet ports, it is generally preferred that the combined area of the inlet ports be generally equal to the combined areas of the outlet ports, thereby providing more consistency in flow and pressures, and also providing for an appropriate hydrodynamic balancing of the rotor 20 within the chamber 12. [0022] Rotor 20 is further defined by walls 29 and 30 , with the preferred material of construction being titanium. A suitable biocompatible material such as pyrolytic carbon, polycarbonate, acrylic, or copolymers of polystyrene may also be employed. Alternatively, a coating may be applied to a suitable substrate in order to enhance the biocompatibility of the structure, with pyrolytic carbon being one highly suited coating. In those instances where the device is not being employed for implantation, but nevertheless is intended for incidental contact with human blood, then, of course, other materials may be employed, provided that the blood-contacting surfaces be formed and/or coated with a non-thrombogenic material. The Rotor Detail [0023] Rotor 20 is provided with a hollow core or void area as at 32 , with this area providing a means for controlling the relative density of the rotor body. Preferably, the relative density is selected by the ratio of the relative density of the rotor to that of the fluid being pumped, and in most applications, the relative density of the rotor to the fluid being pumped is between about 0.3 and 0.6, with it being understood that relative densities of between about 0.1 and 0.9 may be found useful. Also, the dual conical configuration of rotor 20 provides the finished structure with an axial length along the axis of rotation as being generally equal to the axial length of the pumping chamber between the inlet ports 16 and 17. The transverse diameter of the rotor 20 is defined along a medial plane, as along medial line 33 and with the configuration of the dual converging cones providing a clearance between the surface of the rotor and the inner surface of the pumping chamber as illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 5. The rate of increase of clearance is preferably proportional to the increase of the circumference of the rotor from the polar tip to the medial plane, with this increase in clearance providing a generally consistent rate of motion for the fluid being pumped as it moves along its translational and rotational motions and/or vectors. With these considerations in mind and for pumping human blood, the clearance between the inner surface of the pumping chamber and the periphery of the rotor preferably ranges from between about 1 millimeter up to about 7 millimeters, with a narrower range of between about 1 millimeter and 3 millimeters being generally preferred. Generally, a clearance of about 1.5 millimeters is preferred. [0024] While the rotor structure illustrated is described as being relatively smooth, vanes may be employed on the structure with the vanes forming arcuately spaced passages within the rotor. In other words, the vanes may be formed as individual arcuately spaced paddles to form spaced-apart fluid passages and/or channels. One such structure is illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. [0025] The moment of inertia of the rotor or impeller is effectively minimized by virtue of the positioning of the mass of the impeller closer to the center of gravity (or center of mass). This may be obtained by moving the mass of the impeller needed for structural integrity closer to the center, and generally as closely as possible to the rotational axis. The moment of inertia may be controllably adjusted in connection with the structure of the present invention by arranging and mounting the permanent magnets within a circular or annular zone which is at the maximum radius of the rotor inner impeller, as required, while increasing the strength of the structure along its axis of rotation. General Commentary [0026] As has been indicated, the drive means for the electromagnetic drive elements 26 - 26 and 27 - 27 is preferably in the form of conductor windings, and for purposes of achieving appropriate hydrodynamic balance, the windings are carefully controlled and selectively made so as to preserve the hydrodynamic balance of the rotating rotor while eliminating the need for any form of bearing. [0027] With respect to the fluid being pumped, it should be noted that the human blood has a viscosity of about 4 centipoises at 25\u00b0 C., and this viscosity is sufficient to provide for sufficient friction between a relatively smooth rotor surface and blood so as to achieve a sufficient rotational component of motion for hydrodynamic balancing. As the rotational velocity of the fluid being pumped increases, its hydrodynamic balance effect will, of course, increase correspondingly and proportionately. With a rotational velocity of approximately 1000 rpm, the hydrodynamic balancing effect substantially overwhelms the buoyant effect afforded by the relative density of the rotor within the chamber. [0028] For start-up purposes, saline is normally preferred as the functional material, with the saline being employed for a period of time until the desired rotational velocity is achieved, and thereafter blood may be introduced as the working solution being pumped and/or transferred. [0029] An example of an external transfer of fluids between the oppositely disposed fluid inlet ports is a fluid transfer line which introduces the fluids at opposite ends of the housing. As an example of an internal transfer, a bore may be provided which extends between opposite ends of the rotor, thereby permitting transfer of fluids internally of the structure. [0030] The term \u201coppositely disposed inlet ports\u201d is intended to reflect the utilization of fluid introduction at opposite ends of the rotor, and is also intended to include those arrangements wherein all of the fluid being pumped is initially introduced into one polar region of the housing, with the fluid nevertheless being transferred either internally or externally of the housing directly to the oppositely disposed polar region."

  "negative": "The novel system pertains to a multifocal intraocular lens design. This new lens features an optic component with a central and a peripheral element, and a layer nestled along the lens's light pathway. This layer, located between the central and peripheral elements, aids in the modification of the lens's focal point. Additionally, a bordering section communicates with the optic segment, enabling adjustment of focal points when a media transitions in response to muscular contractions. However, this system utilizes a fixed rather than a flowable media and does not engage ciliary muscles to adjust lens power, thus differing from accommodating intraocular lens systems. The peripheral component can be rigid or elastic depending on the design specifics. The interface between the lens and peripheral component ensures stability and precise orientation when implanted within the eye. Refractive power changes in this lens are achieved through relative movements within its components, manipulating the media's disposition between the optic and peripheral parts, though it is not flowable.\n\n",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cataracts are a major cause of blindness in the world and the most prevalent ocular disease. When the disability from cataracts affects or alters an individual&#39;s activities of daily living, surgical lens removal with intraocular lens (\u201cIOL\u201d) implantation is the preferred method of treating the functional limitations. A cataract is any opacity of a patient&#39;s lens, whether it is a localized opacity or a diffuse general loss of transparency. To be clinically significant, however, the cataract must cause a significant reduction in visual acuity or a functional impairment. A cataract occurs as a result of aging or secondary to hereditary factors, trauma, inflammation, metabolic or nutritional disorders, or radiation. Age-related cataract conditions are the most common. In treating a cataract, the surgeon removes the crystalline lens matrix from the lens capsule and replaces it with an IOL. The typical IOL provides a selected focal length that allows the patient to have fairly good distance vision. Since the lens can no longer accommodate, however, the patient typically needs glasses for reading. More specifically, the imaging properties of the human eye are facilitated by several optical interfaces. A healthy youthful human eye has a total power of approximately 59 diopters, with the anterior surface of the cornea (e.g., the exterior surface, including the tear layer) providing about 48 diopters of power, while the posterior surface provides about \u22124 diopters. The crystalline lens, which is situated posterior of the pupil in a transparent elastic capsule, also referred to herein as \u201ccapsular sac,\u201d supported by the ciliary muscles via zonules, provides about 15 diopters of power, and also performs the critical function of focusing images upon the retina. This focusing ability, referred to as \u201caccommodation,\u201d enables imaging of objects at various distances. The power of the lens in a youthful eye can be adjusted from 15 diopters to about 29 diopters by adjusting the shape of the lens from a moderately convex shape to a highly convex shape. The mechanism generally accepted to cause this adjustment is that ciliary muscles supporting the capsule (and the lens contained therein) move between a relaxed state (corresponding to the moderately convex shape) and a contracted state (corresponding to the highly convex shape). Because the lens itself is composed of viscous, gelatinous transparent fibers, arranged in an \u201conion-like\u201d layered structure, forces applied to the capsule by the ciliary muscles via the zonules cause the lens to change shape. Isolated from the eye, the relaxed capsule and lens take on a more spherical shape. Within the eye, however, the capsule is connected around its circumference by approximately 70 tiny ligament fibers to the ciliary muscles, which in turn are attached to an inner surface of the eyeball. The ciliary muscles that support the lens and capsule therefore are believed to act in a sphincter-muscular mode. Accordingly, when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, the capsule and lens are pulled about the circumference to a larger diameter, thereby flattening the lens, whereas when the ciliary muscles are contracted the lens and capsule relax somewhat and assume a smaller diameter that approaches a more spherical shape. As noted above, the youthful eye has approximately 14 diopters of accommodation. As a person ages, the lens hardens and becomes less elastic, so that by about age 45-50, accommodation is reduced to about 2 diopters. At a later age the lens may be considered to be non-accommodating, a condition known as \u201cpresbyopia\u201d. Because the imaging distance is fixed, presbyopia typically entails the need for bi-focals to facilitate near and far vision. Apart from age-related loss of accommodation ability, such loss is innate to the placement of IOLs for the treatment of cataracts. IOLs are generally single element lenses made from a suitable polymer material, such as acrylics or silicones. After placement, accommodation is no longer possible, although this ability is typically already lost for persons receiving an IOL. There is significant need to provide for accommodation in IOL products so that IOL recipients will have accommodating ability. Although efforts have been made with accommodating IOLs, there is a need for an accommodating IOL that can restore as much accommodation to the eye as possible. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the invention is an accommodating intraocular lens. The lens includes an optic portion comprising an anterior element, a posterior element, and an intermediate layer disposed along an optical path of the lens, wherein the intermediate layer is disposed between the anterior element and the posterior element. The lens also includes a peripheral portion in fluid communication with the optic portion. The intraocular lens is adapted such that when a flowable media is moved between the peripheral portion and the optic portion in response to ciliary muscle movement, at least two of the anterior element, the posterior element, and the intermediate layer move from a first configuration to a second configuration.

In some embodiments the anterior element is bonded to the intermediate layer, which can be along the periphery of the anterior layer. The intermediate layer can be bonded to the posterior element. In some embodiments the intermediate layer comprises an actuator, which can be in contact with the anterior element throughout an entire accommodation range of the intraocular lens, or which can be in contact with the anterior element only through a portion of an entire accommodation range of the intraocular lens. The actuator can assume a substantially conical configuration in a disaccommodated configuration. In some embodiments the peripheral portion is coupled to the posterior element. The posterior element can include a buttress element disposed at the periphery of the posterior element, and the peripheral portion is coupled to the buttress element. The peripheral portion can comprises a haptic and the haptic comprises a connection element adapted to fit within a bore in the buttress element.

One aspect of the invention is a method of changing an optical parameter of an accommodating intraocular lens. The method includes providing an intraocular lens comprising an optic portion and a peripheral portion extending peripherally from the optic portion, wherein the optic portion comprises an anterior element, a posterior element, and an intermediate layer disposed between the anterior element and the posterior element. The optic portion and the peripheral portion are in fluid communication. The method also includes moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the peripheral portion in response to ciliary muscle movement to change an optical parameter of the intraocular lens, wherein moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the peripheral portion comprises moving at least two of the anterior element, the intermediate layer, and the posterior element from a first configuration to a second configuration. In some embodiments moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the peripheral portion comprises deforming the peripheral portion. Moving at least two of the anterior element, the intermediate layer, and the posterior element can comprise moving the intermediate layer and the anterior element from a first configuration to a second configuration. In some embodiments the intermediate layer and the posterior element define an active channel in fluid communication with the peripheral portion, and the intermediate layer and the anterior element define a passive chamber containing a second flowable media therein. The method may further comprise index matching the anterior element, the intermediate layer, the posterior element, the second flowable media, and the flowable media. One aspect of the invention is a method of changing the power of an accommodating intraocular lens. The method includes providing an intraocular lens including an optic portion and a non-optic peripheral portion, wherein the optic portion comprises an anterior element, a posterior element, and an intermediate layer disposed between the anterior element and the posterior element, and wherein an anterior surface of the anterior element defines an anterior surface of the intraocular lens, and wherein a posterior surface of the posterior element defines a posterior surface of the intraocular lens. The method also includes moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the non-optic portion in response to ciliary muscle movement to change the power of the intraocular lens, wherein moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the non-optic portion comprises moving at least one of the anterior surface of the intraocular lens and the posterior surface of the intraocular lens. In some embodiments moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the non-optic portion comprises deforming the non-optic portion. Moving a flowable media between the optic portion and the non-optic portion can comprise moving the intermediate layer from a first configuration to a second configuration. In some embodiments the intermediate layer and the posterior element define an active channel in fluid communication with the peripheral portion, and the intermediate layer and the anterior element define a passive chamber containing a second flowable media therein. The method also includes index matching the anterior element, the intermediate layer, the posterior element, the second flowable media, and the flowable media.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to intraocular lenses (\u201cIOLs\u201d) and particularly to accommodating intraocular lenses. In preferred embodiments the IOL includes a flowable media (such as a fluid, gelatinous material, etc.) that is moved within the IOL, in response to ciliary muscle movement, to change the power of the IOL. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the structure and operation of a human eye. Eye 100 includes cornea 1 , iris 2 , ciliary muscles 3 , ligament fibers or zonules 4 , capsule 5 , lens 6 and retina 7. Natural lens 6 is composed of viscous, gelatinous transparent fibers, arranged in an \u201conion-like\u201d layered structure, and is disposed in transparent elastic capsule 5. Capsule 5 is joined by zonules 4 around its circumference to ciliary muscles 3 , which are in turn attached to the inner surface of eye 0. Vitreous 8 is a highly viscous, transparent fluid that fills the center of eye 100. Isolated from the eye, the relaxed capsule and lens take on a convex shape. However, when suspended within the eye by zonules 4 , capsule 5 moves between a moderately convex shape (when the ciliary muscles are relaxed) and a highly convex shape (when the ciliary muscles are contracted). As shown in FIG. 2A , when ciliary muscles 3 relax, capsule 5 and lens 6 are pulled about the circumference, thereby flattening the lens. As shown in FIG. 2B , when ciliary muscles 3 contract, capsule 5 and lens 6 relax and become thicker. This allows the lens and capsule to assume a more convex shape, thus increasing the diopter power of the lens. Additionally, various natural mechanisms affect the design requirements of the present invention. For example, during accommodation the pupil naturally stops down (i.e., reduces in diameter) which reduces the area of the natural lens that transmits light. In addition, the eye will experience the Stiles-Crawford Effect which also reduces the effective area of the natural lens. In particular, the brightness of light rays incident on cones in the eye is dependent on the angle at which those rays are incident on the cones. In particular, light rays that strike the cones perpendicular to their surface appear brighter than those that do not. As a result, the light rays passing through the periphery of the lens are less significant for proper vision. FIGS. 3-5 show a first embodiment of accommodating IOL 10. IOL 10 includes a peripheral non-optic portion comprising haptics 12 and 14. The IOL also includes an optic portion including anterior lens element 16 , intermediate layer 18 which comprises actuator 20 , and substrate, or posterior element 22. Anterior element 16 is bonded to intermediate layer 18 at its periphery. In some embodiments the anterior element may also be bonded to actuator 20. The intermediate layer is also bonded to posterior element 22. The inner surface of haptics 12 and 14 define interior volumes 24 which are in fluid communication with active channel 26 defined by posterior element 22 and intermediate layer 18. As shown, actuator 20 is integral with intermediate layer 18. Posterior element 22 is molded with buttresses 11 which include a buttress bore 13 therethrough. The haptics have a haptic attachment element 15 (which can be stiff or flexible) which is sized and shaped to fit within buttress bore 13. An adhesive layer can be applied to the outer surfaces of the haptic attachment elements and/or the inner surface of the buttress bore to facilitate attachment of the haptics to the optic portion."

  "pos": "[0001] This application claims benefit from provisional application No. 60/851,687, filed Oct. 13, 2006. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention concerns balloon brachytherapy. [0003] Balloon brachytherapy has been known since at least the 1950s, and involves placing a source of radiation within the body, generally near a tumor or within an excision site following removal of a tumor. The purpose or objective is to irradiate the tumor or the margins around the tumor excision cavity. The usual further objective is to provide dose levels of radiation to a target tissue volume surrounding the excision cavity which attain a therapeutic minimum, but below a level capable of producing significant normal-cell tissue necrosis. To accomplish this, a balloon applicator is employed into which the source of radiation is positioned. [0004] Several improvements in applicator design are desirable. In anticipation of radiation therapy to follow complete or partial tumor excision, applicators can be placed within the excision cavity intraoperatively, i.e., during the surgical procedure and before the resection incision is closed. They may also be placed during a separate procedure at a later date when it has been decided to proceed with radiation therapy. Access to the excision cavity for radiation therapy may be through the original incision, or through a different incision purposely created for the applicator. A separate access site might be preferred if the anticipated dose distribution from the brachytherapy protocol, given the location of the excision cavity and proximity to sensitive tissue structures, might place those tissues at risk. When placed intraoperatively, the incision is closed around a sheath, which extends through and outside the skin of the patient. The applicator balloon is usually inflated when the incision is closed, and remains in place until radiation treatment is abandoned or the protocol completed, at which time the balloon is deflated and the applicator surgically removed. [0005] Current or prior art balloon applicators include those described in J. H. Muller, Radiotherapy of Bladder Cancer by Means of Rubber Balloons Filled In Situ with Solutions of a Radioactive Isotope ( Co 60 ), Cancer, September-October, 1955, pp 1035-1043; The Clinical Use of Radioisotopes , B. V. A Low-Beer, Charles C. Thomas Publ., 1950; A New Technique of Brachytherapy for Malignant Gliomas with Caesium 137: A New Method Utilizing a New Afterloading System , R. D. Ashpole, et al, Clinical Oncology, vol. 2, 333-337, (1990); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,221. Radiation sources used for brachytherapy include small x-ray tubes as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,566,221, 6,319,188, and 6,987,835. Solid high-dose radiation isotope sources may be used, for example those sold by Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., and fluid isotope sources, for example a solution or slurry of radionuclides such as I-125 or Au-198. X-ray tubes offer both patient and therapist advantages including substantially reduced amounts of radiation and control of the radiation source. Radioisotope sources must be used inside bunkers lined with lead or other absorbers, with the patient being isolated in the bunker. Use of x-ray tubes is not subject to these restrictions. Unlike an x-ray tube, radioisotopes cannot be turned on and off, but rather emit radiation continuously. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are additional substantial differences between x-ray tube brachytherapy and radionuclide brachytherapy. [0006] Radiation treatment often follows days after surgery, but preferably it follows weeks after surgery [See Breast Cancer Research and Treatment , J. J. Jobson, et al (2006) 99:289-294] and such protracted exposure of the surgical wound at the entry of the applicator sheath through the skin prior to commencing radiotherapy provides a substantial risk of infection that can compromise the resection cavity, and cause additional serious complications for the patient. Also, there can be significant discomfort if the applicator is placed intraoperatively and remains indwelling for an extended period and is perhaps inflated later prior to radiotherapy, or is placed and inflated later in a subsequent procedure, disturbing anatomy which is still sensitive from the resection. It would be beneficial to have an applicator and method which would minimize or eliminate this discomfort and infection risk, but otherwise offer the same or improved functionality and convenience as current applicators. Cozening application Ser. No. 10/464,140, filed Jun. 18, 2003, discloses methods of intraoperative brachytherapy using electronic x-ray tubes, and the disclosure of that application is incorporated by reference herein. Cozening application Ser. No. 11/811,069 discloses an everting gynecological applicator, and the disclosure of that applicator is also incorporated by reference herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] This invention is directed to placing apparatus within a tumor resection cavity, preferably intraoperatively, such that the cavity may be easily reaccessed later for brachytherapy, but which allows the skin to be closed in the interim, thus facilitating healing. This method eliminates the need for apparatus passing through the skin between the resection procedure and initiation of radiation therapy. Such protruding apparatus can be easily bumped or disturbed, causing pain and perhaps infection, thereby impeding the healing process. [0008] The apparatus of this invention comprises an expandable balloon which can be inflated within the excision cavity intraoperatively, after which the incision used to create or access the cavity is closed completely so healing can progress. At a later date when and if brachytherapy is to proceed, balloon access is reacquired, either by reopening the original incision or through a new incision at a preferable site. If such treatment is contra-indicated, the apparatus is used for deflation if necessary, and for removal of the apparatus entirely. [0009] Advantageously the balloon apparatus further comprises an integral extension or a hollow sheath having length and forming a single longitudinal channel or a plurality of such channels which communicate with or extend into the balloon, and when accessed to commence radiation treatment, facilitate inflation or other functionality as outlined below. The channels can be fluid channels, such as for balloon inflation, infusion of anesthetic or therapeutic agents, cavity drainage, or they can accommodate instruments, inner sheaths or catheters, such as a catheter with a radiation source at its distal tip. When reaccessed by means of a new incision (or by reopening an old incision), the extension can be pulled outwardly to provide easy access to the balloon through the incision. [0010] In a further embodiment, a housing at the proximal end of the sheath is affixed to the underside of the skin of the patient in a preferred location, preferably intraoperatively. The housing provides for self-sealing, percutaneous access to the sheath and balloon, but in other respects provides the same functionality as described above. [0011] In yet another embodiment, the balloon is eliminated and a sheath provided which extends from under the skin well into the excision cavity. At commencement of radiotherapy, the skin over the closed end of the implanted sheath is incised, and the sheath withdrawn, but not so far as to lose communication with the excision cavity. The end of the sheath, if closed, is the cut off or otherwise removed, and a conventional balloon applicator (see Brachytherapy, 6 (2007), 207-211, Smitt &amp; Kirby, \u201cDose\u2014volume characteristics of a 50-kV electronic brachytherapy source for intracavitary accelerated partial breast irradiation) inserted into the implanted sheath such that the balloon is within the cavity, and the balloon inflated. The source catheter can then be inserted and brachytherapy begun. [0012] In general, it is preferable that there be a portion of the sheath or balloon extension which protrudes outside of the patient&#39;s skin and which can be later further extended, gripped and/or manipulated. Such extensions can be corrugated, everted, and/or elastic such that they can be stretched outwardly beyond the surface of the patient&#39;s skin. [0013] In the apparatus described above, it is preferable that a channel providing for drug or anesthetic delivery to, or seroma drainage from the cavity before commencing and/or during radiation therapy be incorporated in the apparatus of the invention. [0014] From the description above, other embodiments will occur to those of skill in the art and are to be considered as within the scope of the invention.

[0031] FIG. 6C is a view of the apparatus of FIG. 6B with a conventional hub attached to the proximal end of the sheath, and a source catheter inserted into the sheath and advanced into the balloon. A conventional seal has been provided within the hub to allow a suction channel to drain the excision cavity. [0032] FIGS. 7A and B are section views through body tissue which show an implanted sheath similar to that of FIG. 5A , without a balloon, the sheath being later accessed and drawn outward ( FIG. 7B ) in a way similar to that shown in FIG. 5B. [0033] FIG. 8A is a section view through body tissue showing a straight sheath implanted under the skin of the patient with its distal end well into the incision cavity following surgery. [0034] FIG. 8B is a section view of the sheath of FIG. 8A having been reaccessed through the skin of the patient and drawn outwards in much the same manner as the sheath of FIG. 7B. [0035] FIG. 9 is a section view through tissue showing an implanted sheath of FIG. 7 or 8 , with its closed end removed and with an inner sheath comprising a balloon and hub inserted into the implanted sheath. A source catheter is shown within the inner sheath for purposes of irradiating the inside of the incision cavity. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0036] The method of this invention comprises placing apparatus within or proximate a tumor resection cavity which facilitates easy reaccess to the cavity for brachytherapy. Such apparatus is preferably placed intraoperatively (but could be placed later in a separate procedure) and allows the skin to be closed pending a decision to proceed with, or to abandon brachytherapy. This method eliminates the need for apparatus passing through the skin for a protracted period and optionally provides for administration of therapeutic agents or anesthetic during subsequent apparatus manipulation or the brachytherapy treatment itself. The embodiments described below are used in conjunction with conventional brachytherapy apparatus. [0037] The embodiments of the invention generally provide a convenient path for conventional brachytherapy apparatus to be inserted into the resection cavity some protracted time after the resection procedure itself. The procedure to reaccess the cavity begins with an incision (or percutaneous stick) to reach a portion of the implanted apparatus which is preferably near the skin of the patient. Next, an extension of the apparatus is established which protrudes through the skin at its proximal end, and leads into the resection cavity. Subsequent steps will depend on the invention embodiment chosen, but all lead to facilitating use of conventional brachytherapy methods and/or apparatus to complete the brachytherapy. [0038] FIG. 1 depicts an apparatus 100 including a simple balloon 101 placed intraoperatively within the body and inflated in an excision cavity. A self-sealing patch 102 anywhere on the surface of the balloon suffices for inflation by a syringe. The patch can be relatively small compared to the balloon surface, or it can cover a significant portion of the surface. Self-sealing patch materials include various gel materials known in the art and silicone elastomers. Suitable balloon materials include polyurethanes and silicone rubbers. At one extreme, the material may be selected, and balloons may be designed, which are sufficiently elastic to conform to shape of the excision cavity. At the other extreme, materials and designs can be chosen which will substantially shape the cavity so that it conforms to a desired configuration, for example, so that it mimics the shape of the isodose surfaces which are generated by the brachytherapy source and apparatus in total and/or which correspond to the planned therapy. It is therefore also clear that balloon designs can be devised with properties between these extremes. As an example of such apparatus 100 , if the excision cavity is spherical, or can be forced into a spherical shape, an isotropic point source and spherical balloon filled with an absorber might advantageously be employed to produce a series of spherical isodose surfaces, each surface with decreasing dose at greater and greater radii from the source. [0039] FIGS. 2A and B depict a balloon 201 having a long radial extension 202 , shaped somewhat like a test tube. The length of the extension is greater than the distance between the excision cavity and the skin. The balloon can be partially inflated and the extension everted, for example by a rod (not shown), and with the rod removed, placed within the cavity positioned for later access through a cut down procedure or percutaneous stick at a desired location through the skin. See FIG. 2A for this configuration. Palpation may be adequate to locate the extension, or if desired, the skin can be marked for future access, for example by a tattoo dot 210. Once positioned, the balloon can be fully inflated as described with respect to FIG. 1 above so as to maintain the cavity until radiation brachytherapy is commenced. The incision is then closed over the brachytherapy balloon apparatus to begin the healing process. No parts of the apparatus protrude through the skin once the incision is closed. [0040] When irradiation is to begin, the balloon extension 202 is accessed by percutaneous stick or incision, and the balloon extension withdrawn outwardly through the skin as shown in FIG. 2B. Note that balloon pressure will tend to make the extension evert spontaneously. The end of the extension can then be manipulated to allow insertion of a radiation source catheter 203. A preferred method is to insert a source catheter with a radiation source 204 at its tip into the extension such that the extension re-everts as the catheter is advanced into the balloon. Graduation marks 205 ( FIG. 2C ) on the catheter can be used to accurately position the depth of the catheter within the incision cavity. Such positioning can be confirmed by conventional imaging, and if desired, a clamp (not shown) can be used to secure the catheter within the protruding extension near its point of re-eversion to maintain the source position. [0041] Rather than re-eversion as shown in FIG. 2C , the extension may be cut off and a conventional hub with internal seal (not shown; similar to that of FIG. 6C ) attached in an appropriate manner to the extension. It may be necessary to reestablish balloon inflation after the catheter is started into the hub and balloon extension. Graduation marks may be used to indicate position of the catheter within the balloon."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for improving stability in a current feedback circuit and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for eliminating low-frequency drift in the diode drive circuit of an oximeter. [0003] 2. Related Work [0004] A pulse oximeter is a type of blood gas monitor which non-invasively measures an amount of saturation of oxygen in the blood. The saturation of oxygenated blood may be determined from the peak-to-peak voltages or from instantaneous differential voltages for two plethysmographic waveforms measured at separate wavelengths. The two waveforms are produced by driving a visible red light-emitting diode (LED) and an infra-red LED to produce two lights that pass through a patient&#39;s tissue, and then detecting the light on an opposite side or same side of the tissue using one or more photodetectors. The light-emitting LEDs are placed in a probe that is attached to the patient&#39;s body in a preferred location for the particular application. Although most conventional oximeters use the red and infra-red LEDs, other devices such as surface emitting laser devices having different wavelengths may also be used, and the number of LEDs can vary according to the specific measurement application. For example, it is known to set a number of laser diodes to be equal to or greater than the number of blood analytes that are to be measured by the instrument. [0005] A conventional photodetector output signal indicates the attenuation of the two different wavelength lights from the LEDs after the lights pass through the patient&#39;s body. In order to obtain a degree of consistency and ease of use, the photodetector is generally placed in a clip or similar device attached to the patient&#39;s finger or earlobe. Attenuation of the lights is substantially constant except for the flow of blood. Thus, the constant attenuation due to the light passing through the patient&#39;s skin and other tissue can be determined and filtered from the photodetector signal, thereby obtaining a signal representing the desired blood oxygen characteristics. Signals containing a component related to a patient&#39;s pulse are known as plethysmographic waves and are used in blood gas saturation measurements. So, for example, the red/infra-red ratio for waveforms at different wavelengths may be analyzed to obtain oxygenization values. [0006] A photoplethysmographic measurement system used for oximetry typically isolates and separates components of composite detected signals in order to identify and remove noise sources, and then analyzes pulsatile components related to blood oxygen measurements. Conventional systems utilize complex signal processing for filtering noise and separating-out the signals that are due to absorption of the emitted diode light by the patient&#39;s tissue other than the arterial vessels. In oximetry detection and processing, it is critical to reduce noise because signal levels for measuring arterial blood oxygen saturation levels are extremely small. Ambient light can generate high levels of electrical noise unless detectors are shielded and adapted to physically blocking external light during a measurement. Other noise sources are typically present in, for example, a hospital environment. Electromagnetic radiation from various patient monitors may each have their own particular operating frequencies, a hospital may use radiotelemetry in systems such as wireless patient charts, and RF noise from cell phones, computers, and television, etc. may create a combined complex background noise that can combine and interfere with the ambient light noise. Similarly, patient motion causes motion artifacts that create difficulties in providing accurate oximetry measurements. [0007] It is known to activate the red and infra-red LEDs during different time periods, where the two LEDs are cycled on and off alternately, in order to enable the photodetector to receive one signal at a time. As a result of generating LED pulse trains in a time-division manner, a composite time-division signal is then received by the photodetector. Alternatively, switching of LEDs may be related to other parameters such as maintaining a particular duty cycle without regard to time-division multiplexing (TDM). Various methods, not limited to TDM or to periodic switching, for modulating the LEDs can also be employed. [0008] The term \u201cnoise\u201d is known to those of ordinary skill in the oximetry art to include any signal portions relating to ambient light, motion artifacts, absorption variance, electromagnetic radiation, electrical interference, magnetic fields, electronic interference such as harmonics or RF, and others. However, conventional diode driver circuits have not been optimized for producing as clean a diode drive signal as possible. There are two general types of noise associated with an op-amp that are relevant to an LED drive circuit in an oximeter. \u201c1/f noise\u201d is noise which becomes greater per unit bandwidth as the frequency decreases, whereas \u201cwhite noise\u201d remains constant and flat over a broad range of frequencies. [0009] In order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the oximeter, it is desirable to minimize noise in the circuitry used to produce one or more drive currents for causing the LEDs to illuminate. Conventional LED drive circuits have been designed to reduce photic noise generated by the LEDs, in order to maximize a signal-to-noise ratio for the arterial attenuation signal(s) used in processing oximetry data. However, the conventional circuits use ultra low noise operational amplifiers with high gain, which are expensive and inefficient, or simply ignore the problem of a noisy drive circuit because other parts of the oximetry measurement device dominate a system noise. The conventional systems use operational amplifiers that have an ultra low noise specification, which amounts to compensating for rather than eliminating a noise source. As is further discussed below, conventional oximetry systems were not able to see a problem of noise in the diode driver circuit because of conventional signal processing limitations. [0010] Conventional diode drive current circuits may also use \u201cchopper\u201d type op-amp configurations that create additional noise when a corresponding LED is on, due to chopping that is not synchronous with the rest of the system. [0011] Other conventional ways to address a noise problem in an oximeter include using filters to reduce the effects of ambient electromagnetic noise in electronic monitoring instruments, especially when the noise source frequency (or a harmonic of the noise source frequency) is approximately the same as the fundamental frequency or harmonics at which the instrument is operating. Another conventional example is a use of a static bandpass filter to remove a portion of the photodetector&#39;s output noise signal that is outside an identified bandwidth of interest, leaving random and/or erratic noise that is within the filter&#39;s passband. A processor has then been used to separate-out primary signal portions in order to isolate and identify the remaining noise signals, which are then removed using, for example, an adaptive noise canceller. Such a scheme is known as correlation canceling. [0012] A method such as correlation canceling used in conventional oximeters simply accounts for various noise sources by identifying and isolating those separate noises in a processing of detected signals. However, such processing does not isolate, reduce, or eliminate a driver circuit noise itself. [0013] Of particular interest for improving the oximeter performance is a problem of low frequency drift (0.5 to 10 Hz) in the LED drive circuitry and in the intensity level of the LEDs, which then creates drift in a detected signal, particularly in low perfusion conditions where the AC (measurement) component of the LED intensity is small. If the power and intensity of the LED varies within the physiologically-related passband (\u201cphysio passband\u201d), the resultant intensity variation becomes an amplified error that is subsequently read as a phisiological signal by a detector, creating an erroneous oximeter reading. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0014] Since a signal-to-noise ratio is increased by decreasing the noise, a decrease in the floor noise allows a lower limit for low-pass filtering within the diode drive circuit. The present invention is addressed to this object as well to generally eliminating low frequency drift in LED intensity. The present invention also has an object of improving detection of low level signals. The present invention also has an object of improving a low frequency noise elimination in an LED drive circuit. The present invention also has an object of improving control of noise generation in an LED drive circuit. For example, the problem of LED intensity variation within the physio passband of oximeter operation can be traced to such noise being generated by the LED drive circuit. [0015] A method according to the present invention includes nulling an operational amplifier (op-amp) disposed in the feedback path of a diode drive circuit. [0016] A method of producing a diode drive current in an oximeter, according to the present invention, can include sensing at least a part of a current passing through the diode and converting the sensed current to a sensed voltage, inputting the sensed voltage to a feedback amplifier for stabilizing the current passing through the diode, and eliminating an offset voltage across inputs of the feedback amplifier. [0017] A pulse oximeter that converts pulses into light flashes, according to the present invention, can include a diode for emitting the light flashes, a feedback amplifier having inputs, a feedback capacitor, and an output, the feedback amplifier being operative to stabilize a current passing through the diode, a nulling amplifier having inputs, a nulling capacitor, and an output, the nulling amplifier being operative to charge and discharge the feedback capacitor until the inputs of the feedback amplifier are at a same voltage. [0018] This summary does not limit the invention, which is instead defined by the appended claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURE [0019] [0019]FIG. 1 is a highly schematic diagram of a conventional pulse oximeter system. [0020] [0020]FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a nulling op-amp current feedback circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0021] In general, none of the prior art has considered any \u201cnoise\u201d due to a diode current driving circuit. This is because the conventional signal processing for a detected oximetry signal was unable to detect, discern, or distinguish any noise as being due to the diode driving circuit. Conventional oximetry systems have not attempted to provide a \u201cclean\u201d LED drive circuit with expanded dynamic range, as in the present invention, because a typical detection signal processing did not have the highly increased resolution provided by, for example, state-of-the art oversampling hardware. With better processing hardware having recently been developed, a resultant higher processing capability and greater resolution allows \u201cseeing\u201d smaller noises that were previously unnoticed. Along with improved resolution, it is of paramount importance to reduce noise sources in the LED drive circuitry of an oximeter rather than separating-out resultant signals during processing of signals from the oximeter&#39;s photodetector. By using as clean a diode driving circuit as possible, less noise is present in downstream signals. [0022] Since a signal-to-noise ratio is increased by decreasing the noise, a decrease in the floor noise allows a lower limit for low-pass filtering within the diode drive circuit. The present invention is addressed to this object as well to generally eliminating low frequency drift in LED intensity. Low frequency drift (0.5 to 10 Hz) in the intensity of the LEDs creates a resultant drift in an oximeter measurement, particularly in low perfusion conditions where the AC component of the LED intensity is small. A related application by the present inventor, \u201cFeedback Controlled LED Switching,\u201d details how to use a constant reference voltage to obtain a low noise. However, a problem of 1/f noise in the feedback operational amplifier limits the reduction in low frequency drift. [0023] Various noises such as those due to ambient light can create a DC offset for an input to the operational amplifier used as a current feedback circuit in an LED current driver. The present invention has an object of removing such an offset, whereas conventional systems merely indirectly compensate for such an offset. [0024] [0024]FIG. 1 shows the basic elements of an exemplary pulse oximeter used for implementing the disclosed embodiments. A probe 1 is affixed to a patient to be monitored. The probe 1 contains LEDs 61 that illuminate when a current passes through them, and a photodetector 62 for detecting light. The light emitted by the LEDs 61 passes through the patient&#39;s tissue and a portion of the emitted light is detected by at least one photodetector 62 that is placed on a same or a different location on the patient. The detected light can, therefore, be in a direct path of the emitted light, or can detect reflected light. A monitor 2 contains a user input/output section 55 that may include a speaker, keypad, and display device which allow a user to operate the pulse oximeter. For example, a user is able to adjust a measurement period and/or measurement cycle parameters, and see and hear measurement data and operational status. A digital control section 56 controls the internal operations of the oximeter. A diode current driver circuit 53 controls a current being supplied to individual LEDs 61. An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 52 receives detection signals from the photodetector 62 , converts those detected signals to digital signals that are then processed by the digital control section 56. The monitor 2 also contains a data input/output section 54 that provides both a serial digital data output and an analog output, which allow the oximeter to interface with external equipment, such as a computer. The data input/output section 54 also accepts control signals from external equipment in order to remotely change or control operation of the oximeter. [0025] [0025]FIG. 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of a nulling op-amp current feedback circuit for driving an LED of an oximeter. In FIG. 2, a current feedback amplifier 10 and a nulling amplifier 20 each have their non-inverting inputs connected to a reference voltage V REF through a resistor 15. The other end of resistor 15 is tied to the supply voltage via capacitor 11. The reference voltage V REF is maintained at a fixed level by operation of a zener diode 12. The zener diode 12 has one end connected to a positive supply voltage V+, and the other end connected to one end of a resistor 16. The other end of resistor 16 is connected to ground. A reference voltage V REF terminal A is thereby located at the non-inverting input of the current feedback amplifier 10. A capacitor 17 is connected between the positive supply voltage V+ and V REF terminal A. A first SPDT switch 31 has one throw terminal connected both to V REF terminal A and to the non inverting input of a nulling amplifier 20. The other throw terminal of switch 31 is connected to the non-inverting input of current feedback amplifier 10 through a resistor 18 , to a throw terminal of a second SPDT switch 41 , and to one end of a resistor 19. The common pole of switch 31 is connected to one end of resistor 32. The other end of resistor 32 is connected to the inverting input of the nulling amplifier 20 and to one end of resistor 33. The other end of resistor 33 is connected to a throw terminal of a third SPDT switch 51 , and to one end of a nulling capacitor 34. The other end of the nulling capacitor 34 is connected to the supply voltage V+. The inverting input of current feedback amplifier 10 is also connected to one end of resistor 13. The other end of resistor 13 is connected to the other throw terminal of switch 51 and to one end of feedback nulling capacitor 14. The other end of capacitor 14 is connected to the supply voltage V+. The output of current feedback amplifier 10 is connected to the common pole of switch 41. The output of nulling amplifier 20 is connected to the common pole of switch 51 via nulling slew resistor 21. The other throw terminal of switch 41 is connected to the supply voltage V+via pullup resistor 42 and to the gate of transistor 43. The source of transistor 43 is connected to the other end of resistor 19 and is also connected to the supply voltage V+via a current sense resistor 44. The drain of transistor 43 is connected to the anode of diode 60 through a cable 59. The cathode of diode 60 is connected to ground via the cable 59. In order to prevent any possible oscillation current (ringing noise) caused, for example, when the cable 59 is long and a diode switching speed is high, the output current driving portion may be modified to prevent any oscillations, for example, as disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. ______, entitled \u201cFerrite Stabilized LED Drive,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. [0026] In the FIG. 2 embodiment, switches 31 , 41 , 51 are configured as three ganged SPDT switches. Other switch combinations that implement a triple ganged switching arrangement can also be used, such as a use of a DPDT together with a SPDT. In a preferred embodiment, the transistor 43 is a FDC6506P dual P-channel logic level powertrench MOSFET available from Fairchild, although any suitable transistor may be used. Although a zener diode type circuit is used as a reference voltage source in the FIG. 2 embodiment, other reference voltage sources may be used, such as precision low noise reference voltage sources. The reference voltage V REF is a set-point voltage that the current feedback amplifier 10 is attempting to stabilize across the current sense resistor 44. The current sense resistor 44 converts a current, which corresponds to the current through the diode 60 , to the voltage that is being stabilized by the current feedback amplifier 10. [0027] The switches 31 , 41 , 51 are shown in the ON position in FIG. 2. During an ON cycle, the nulling amplifier 20 charges and discharges the nulling capacitor 34. This acts to eliminate any effective input offset voltage in the nulling amplifier 20."

  "query": "What advancements in thermal ablation systems for tissue treatment are described in the context of cryotherapy and real-time MRI guidance?,",
  "negative": "A novel thermal ablation procedure for tissue treatment involves the real-time guidance of therapy through advanced imagining modalities. This innovative technique is particularly advantageous for addressing conditions such as benign or cancerous growths across various organs, including but not limited to the pancreas, brain, or bone marrow. Thermal ablation, achieved through either extreme heat or cold, allows for the precise eradication of affected tissues. The employment of steady temperatures is critical as it leads to the disruption of cellular integrity, ultimately causing cell demise. A pivotal factor in the efficacy of the procedure is the duration of the temperature\u2019s application. Imaging technologies, distinct from MRI, sometimes provide incomplete knowledge regarding the true extent of the impacted tissue, given their limited scope in detecting the full three-dimensional area. Despite their limited scope, these techniques, which utilize alternative visual representations of anatomical structures, can be advantageous during certain stages of medical interventions. Patent literature delineates advancements in thermal ablation systems, underscoring imaging methods that furnish superior contrast and real-time visualization of the target area under treatment. Instruments specifically crafted for these tasks must exhibit immunity to the powerful imaging system's environmental conditions, such as magnetic fields. Ensuring that devices and electronic elements are shielded against induced currents is paramount for maintaining system integrity and accurate imaging results. Some thermal ablation methods may not provide comprehensive temperature data across the entire tissue region undergoing thermal ablation, thus highlighting the need for systems that can deliver comprehensive thermal profiles to clinicians for optimizing treatment strategies. A practical approach to treatment involves utilizing observable markers to verify the precise location of tissue targets, assisting in the delivery of therapeutic energy and enhancing the treatment outcome while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. The procedural framework presented here outlines a system that does not rely on magnetic resonance information and instead employs alternative data points to regulate the cryotherapy method and ensure effective tissue treatment.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of provisional patent application No. 61/203,313, filed Dec. 23, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to planning, monitoring and regulation of temperature gradients, or isotherms, for thermal treatment of tissue, and in particular, the cryoablation of tissue. Thermal treatment of tissues has become an increasingly effective method of treatment for a variety of pathological cases. For example, malignancies in body organs such as liver, lungs, kidney, prostate, breast, and other organs are successfully treated by thermal ablation when heat or cold irreversibly destroys pathological tissue. Target temperatures are generally emphasized since irreversible changes that destroy a cell occur more reliably at those levels, but the time that those target temperatures are maintained are also important. For example, consistent cell death using heat usually requires temperatures greater than 50\u00b0 C. for over one (1) minute, while tissue freezing usually requires two (2) cycles of target tissue temperatures less than \u221220\u00b0 C. for greater than three (3) minutes each, interspaced by a passive thaw of greater than three (3) minutes. These general assumptions are variable depending upon local tissue conditions of: 1) adjacent blood vessels, or vasculature, acting as heat sinks; 2) tissue perfusion from blood flow of the micro vasculature, and; 3) the overall thermal characteristics of the tissue, such as thermal conductivity and capacity, which appear related to the ratio of fluid and/or fibrous content. In connection with cryo-treatments, the localized anatomy surrounding a target area to be treated (e.g., frozen), or tumor, may be assessed by various imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US), X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound clearly shows only the bright echoes from the leading edge of the ice closest to the ultrasound probe. The interface between frozen and non-frozen tissue has marked sound speed differences. Nearly all echoes are reflected with minimal signal penetrating the iceball. This causes marked shadowing behind the leading ice edge, obscuring all posterior structures. Plain X-ray technique is only capable of showing the border of the lower density frozen tissue. This is possible, however, only if the tissue is sufficiently compressed to allow detection of the density difference as a projected shadow that is perpendicular to the main axis of the x-ray. Both ultrasound and x-ray techniques thus provide only partial information concerning the size and position of three-dimensional frozen tissue, and cannot define the full three-dimensional cryoablation volume contained within the frozen tissue. CT and MRI techniques are preferred over ultrasound and x-ray since they can produce a reconstructed tissue volume from the usual sequence of axial images. In addition, they can be performed before, during and after intravenous contrast enhancement to assess the vascularity of the target tumor relative to the surrounding tissues. CT is more readily available than interventional MR units within the community and doesn&#39;t have metal incompatibility issues. However, MRI can provide greater contrast between the different soft and/or frozen tissues than CT and has temperature-sensitive imaging sequences. Unlike CT, MRI uses no ionizing radiation, but uses a powerful magnetic field and pulsed radiofrequency fields to cause the hydrogen nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner. These signals can be manipulated by additional magnetic fields to build up enough information to construct a volumetric image of the target object. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,773,408 and 6,904,305 relate to MRI medical interventional procedures and therapies, applying ablation energy to the target tissues, and further relate to monitoring such therapy by magnetic resonance application. The technology described in the &#39;408 and &#39;305 patents are partially based on the fact that certain known MRI sequences are temperature sensitive, so that magnetic resonance data acquired using these procedures will indicate changes in the temperature of the tissues. For example, a magnetic resonance parameter referred to as T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) will vary with temperature. If a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus is actuated to acquire T1 for various volume elements within the subject, the data for different elements will vary with temperature, at least within a tissue having generally the same composition. The data can be displayed as a visible image, and hence different temperatures can be shown by the differences in brightness or color within the displayed image. Unfortunately, this approach can only display the degree of the heating within a location within the body being heated. These procedures have been well known but have not been widely adopted in the medical practice. Magnetic resonance imaging instruments include large, precise magnets which are arranged to impose a high magnetic field but also severely limit access to the target subject. Moreover, the MRI instruments must be such so as to be substantially unaffected by the MRI system&#39;s powerful magnetic field. Medical instruments constructed of non-MRI-compatible materials may be subjected to powerful undesired forces generated by magnetic interaction between the instrument and the MRI magnetic field that may distort the MRI image. Additionally, electrical circuits used within the MRI environment must be shielded because they may be subject to induced currents generated within the electrical circuitry. Induced current can lead to uncontrolled processes such as distortion of data or control signals. Electric currents induced by an external magnetic field interacting with components of electronic circuitry could have a distorting effects during its normal operation. For example, electronic circuits with switching components which are switching at high frequencies (e.g., computers) and with potential for emission of electromagnetic fields must be strictly shielded. Another shortcoming of MRI is that commercially available MRI systems do not detect and display temperatures within frozen tissue. Research has been done evaluating ultrashort echo-times to assess the R 2 * parameter and generate temperature assessment within the iceball but these sequences are complex and specialized to limited centers. What is needed is a system that provides capability of direct identification or localization of the isotherms within frozen tissue with reliable identification of the external border of the ablation volume. What is further needed is a system that is capable of providing accurate estimation of the size and position of an ablation volume in cryosurgery, since it is a goal to ablate all pathological tissue while damaging as little as possible of healthy tissue surrounding the pathological tissue. What is further needed is to enable a physician, during a procedure, to have accurate information of what tissues have been frozen. What is further needed is a system adapted to render the border of the ablation volume, or alternatively a system facilitating accurate estimation of the size and position of such a border, to decrease danger of surgical complications and avoid various deleterious consequences to the long-term health and quality of life of the recovering patient. Attempts to provide systems for MRI-guided cryosurgery are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,697 and US Pat. Application No. 2006/0155268. The &#39;697 patent describes a system with inner and outer modules for MRI-guided cryosurgery comprising an MRI magnet having an opening for enabling access of a surgeon to the patient who is accommodated inside the MRI room, a line member of a surgical device extending through MRI magnet channel, a surgical device itself including: (a) an operating member for operating the patient; (b) a control member for controlling the operating member, the control member being positioned externally to the MRI room; (c) a line member having a first end connectable to the operating member and a second end connectable to said control member, wherein a portion of the line member is received within the channel of the MRI magnet. The line member includes an underground portion extending through an underground channel. The operating member is a cryogenic probe including a Joule-Thomson heat exchanger, and the line member is a gas tube. The control member includes a microprocessor for controlling the operation of cryosurgical device. A display member is positioned within the MRI room, the display member being electrically connected to the microprocessor for providing information relating to the operation. The cryogenic probe includes a thermal sensor electrically connected to the microprocessor. A disadvantage of the system described in the &#39;697 patent is the separation of control functions into inner and outer modules that requires two operators of the surgical equipment, a first operator being a surgeon positioned within the inner module, i.e., within magnetic field of the MRI equipment, and a second operator whose function includes inputting gas control commands and reporting to the surgeon the cryosurgery system status which the surgeon from his position into inner module cannot see and estimate for-himself, and cannot directly control. Another disadvantage of the system described in the &#39;697 patent is an impossibility to display and control temperatures within ablated frozen tissue because the thermal sensor placed at the distal end of the cryoprobe can provide only information about temperature in the central point of ablation volume. Application No. 2006/0155268 describes an MRI-guided and compatible cryosurgery system that comprises a cryoprobe operable to be cooled by expansion of high-pressure cooling gas though a Joule-Thomson orifice. This schematically presented system enable a surgeon positioned next to a patient and within an MRI magnetic environment both to monitor progress of an intervention by observing MR images of the intervention in real time, and to fully control aspects of operation of a cryosurgery. The apparatus described may remotely control a fluid supply source positioned external to the magnetic environment thereby enabling real-time MRI-guided control of a cryoablation process. A schematically presented embodiment enables calculation and display of borders of an ablation volume surrounding a cooled cryoprobe, and further enables automated control of elements of a cryoablation procedure, which elements are triggered when shape and position of the calculated ablation volume are found. The schematic intervention module may comprise a plurality of cryoprobes, an MRI-compatible template operable to guide insertion of the cryoprobe into the body of the patient, and a thermal sensor operable to be positioned at a selected position within the body. The cryoprobe may comprise a thermal sensor operable to report temperatures within the cryoprobe or to report temperature external to the cryo probe. A shortcoming of Application No. 2006/0155268 is that complete information about temperature distribution within the frozen volume of ablation with thermal sensors is unavailable. Additionally, the described temperature distribution profile across a schematic frozen tissue formed by the tip of cryosurgical probe, to the external surface of the frozen volume, appears somewhat arbitrary and unrealistic. Thus, there is a need to have a thermal ablation system that can provide to a physician isotherm distribution within the target tissue in order to plan, monitor and control tissue ablation using thermal response for anatomic and tissue characterization. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A system for use with at least one cryoprobe for the treatment of biological tissue with thermal ablation includes receiving procedure data wherein the procedure data comprises an inflow temperature at a location along an inflow conduit of the probe, and an outflow temperature at a location along the outflow conduit. The processor calculates a procedure signature or profile based on the procedure data and compares the procedure signature to a planning signature based on previously acquired image data and or model of the tissue. In another embodiment the planning signature is a planning isotherm volume of tissue and the procedure signature is a tissue isotherm volume obtained during the intervention, or cryoablation. In another embodiment the processor is further operative to compare the information and automatically regulate the flowrate of a cryogen to the cryoprobe. In another embodiment, a method is described for treatment of a target volume of biological tissue using at least one thermal tissue ablation apparatus. The method comprises a number of steps: 1) receiving procedure data, the procedure data comprising an inlet temperature of the fluid within the inlet conduit and at a location within the tissue treatment portion of the apparatus and an outlet temperature of the fluid within the outlet conduit and at a location within the tissue treatment portion of the apparatus; 2) determining a procedure signature based on the procedure data; and 3) comparing the procedure signature to a previously determined planning signature. In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises automatically applying an amount of thermal energy to the tissue based on the comparing step. In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises the step of providing the thermal ablation apparatus wherein the fluid is a cold liquid with a freezing point less than \u221290\u00b0 C. another aspect of the invention, the cold liquid is one liquid selected from the group of propane, perfluropropane, R-124, and R-1270. In another aspect of the invention, the comparing step is performed substantially continuously during the treatment and the amount of thermal energy being applied is adjusted based on real time information determined by the comparing step. In one embodiment, a computer includes a feedback loop and calculates the difference between the two signatures and determines the amount of adjustment to the power parameters of the cryoprobe to force the procedure signature to match or converge with the planned signature. According to one aspect of the invention a method of treatment planning comprises observing a marker, or seed, that is deposited prior to treatment within the target volume and well-visualized by US, CT or MRI. The well-visualized marker is used at the beginning of the treatment session to confirm location of tumor margins and vascularity in relation to actual probe placement. The marker is then used to validate anatomic location of tumor margins and vascularity in relation to developing treatment margins during treatment, thus serving as one of the inputs to continuously adjusted probe power during treatment protocol. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method which allows monitoring of tissue response to thermal changes induced by probes inserted into the target treatment region, whereby that tissue thermal response is reflected in the difference between the inlet temperature of substance entering the exchange chamber at the probe tip and the outlet temperature as it exits the chamber. The disclosure and invention specifically include combination of features of various embodiments as well as combinations of the various embodiments where possible. The description, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description to follow, together with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 a illustrates a thermal ablation control system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Computer 100 is shown in communication with one or more cryoprobes 110 a - f. Computer 100 may be a general purpose computer including a processor. Computer is also in communication with (or has incorporated therein) a controller (not shown) to power the cryoprobes. In the case of a cryoprobe, the controller may control such parameters as flowrate of a cryogen liquid to the cryoprobe, temperature of the cryogen, actuate valves, etc. Additionally, a cryogen tank, refrigerator, pump, electrical supply, and other equipment may be housed in cabinet 120. The probe 110 a includes a handle 112 and a tissue treatment portion 114 or freeze zone. The tissue treatment portion is shown as a rigid shaft having a pointed tip.

The tissue treatment portion encloses an exchange chamber fed by a fluid inlet conduit. The shape of the exchange chamber may vary widely and in one embodiment, comprises an elongate cavity. A fluid outlet conduit is fluidly joined to the exchange chamber to return the fluid to the fluid source or reservoir tank (not shown). The tissue treatment portion applies energy to the tissue, and in the case of a cryo-treatment, freezes the tissue in the vicinity of the tissue treatment portion. An example of a cryoprobe and system that can provide a cryotherapy is described in U.S. Publication No. 20090270851 to Babkin et al., the entirety of which is incorporated by reference. In another embodiment the cryoprobe does not have an exchange chamber per se. The conduit follows a path leading to and from the tissue treatment portion. More than one conduit may be provided and the conduit&#39;s cross section may vary in shape and size. As mentioned above, the present invention includes use of temperature data from the probe. To this end, probes that are useful with the system of the present invention include a sensor within each the fluid inlet conduit and fluid outlet conduit. Preferably, the sensors, such as thermocouples, are located in the tissue treatment portion or freeze zone of the probe and in some cases, in the most distal portion of the tip."

The documentation reveals 5-((1R,3S)-6-fluoro-3-phenyl-indan-1-yl)-1,2,4-trimethyl-piperazine, hereby named Compound X, shows potential in addressing mood disorders and cognitive dysfunction. Compound X has been investigated by Moreno et al. in Intl. J. of Pharm. Sci., 2001, 42, page 302-310, identifying it as the sulfate formulation, see chart 7, compound (-)-47. The study deduces that the (-)-isomer of compound 47 is a NE reuptake inhibitor displaying selectivity in vitro and suggests its non-inducement of hypertensive responses in animal models. Previous mappings of neuropathic etiologies emphasize the role of norepinephrine in anxiety and depressive states, hinting at the therapeutic relevance of NE modulation (Greyson, Brit. J. Psychiatry 1979, 125, 113-119). While NE reuptake inhibition is crucial in alleviating symptoms of depression, it is also associated with the amelioration of chronic pain conditions (Belmaker, Psychopharmacology 1996, 25, 97-108). Compounds targeting norepinephrine pathways, including NE reuptake inhibitors, have been found beneficial in diverse neuropsychiatric and neuropathic disorders, offering an alternate pharmacological strategy (Harvey, Neuropsychopharmacology 2004, 29, 501-517). Clinical trials suggest Compound X's efficacy in a twice-weekly dosage regimen offers an advancement in patient compliance in managing chronic mood disorders. While the exact mechanism is still under investigation, Compound X presents promising treatment profiles for depression and chronic neuropathies.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenyl-indan-1-yl)-1,2,2-trimethyl-piperazine and the salts thereof with activity at dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors as well as the serotonin 5HT 2 receptor for the treatment of diseases in the central nervous system in a once weekly dosing regime. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenyl-indan-1-yl)-1,2,2-trimethyl-piperazine and the salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing these salts and the medical use thereof, including treatment of schizophrenia or other diseases involving psychotic symptoms, is disclosed in WO2005/016900. 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenyl-indan-1-yl)-1,2,2-trimethyl-piperazine is hereinafter referred to as Compound (I) [0000] [0000] Compound (I) is also known as Zicronapine. [0003] EP 638 073 covers a group of trans isomers of 3-aryl-1-(1-piperazinyl)indanes substituted in the 2- and/or 3-position of the piperazine ring. The compounds are described as having high affinity for dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors and the 5-HT 2 receptor and are suggested to be useful for treatment of several diseases in the central nervous system, including schizophrenia. [0004] Compound (I) above has been described by B\u00f8ges\u00f8 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, page 4380-4392, in the form of the fumarate salt, see table 5, compound (-)-38. This publication concludes that the (-)-enantiomers of compound 38 is a potent D 1 /D 2 antagonists showing some D 1 selectivity in vitro. The compound is also described as a potent 5-HT 2 antagonist. It is also mentioned that the compound does not induce catalepsy in rats. [0005] The aetiology of schizophrenia is not known, but the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia formulated in the early 1960s, has provided a theoretical framework for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disorder (Carlsson, Am. J. Psychiatry 1978, 135, 164-173). In its simplest form, the dopamine hypothesis states that schizophrenia is associated with a hyperdopaminergic state, a notion which is supported by the fact that all antipsychotic drugs on the market today exert some dopamine D 2 receptor antagonism (Seeman Science and Medicine 1995, 2, 28-37). However, whereas it is generally accepted that antagonism of dopamine D 2 receptors in the limbic regions of the brain plays a key role in the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the blockade of D 2 receptors in striatal regions of the brain causes extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). As described in EP 638 073 a profile of mixed dopamine D 1 /D 2 receptor inhibition has been observed with some so-called \u201catypical\u201d antipsychotic compounds, in particular with clozapine (8-chloro-11-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4] diazepine), used in treatment of schizophrenic patients. [0006] Further, selective D 1 antagonists have been connected to treatment of sleep disorders and alcohol abuse (D. N. Eder, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2002 3(2):284-288). [0007] Dopamine may also play an important role in the aetiology of affective disorders (P. Willner, Brain. Res. Rev. 1983, 6, 211-224, 225-236 and 237-246; B\u00f8ges\u00f8 et al, J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28, 1817-1828). [0008] In EP 638 073 is described how compounds having affinity for 5-HT 2 receptors, in particular 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists, have been suggested for treatment of different diseases, such as schizophrenia including the negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, migraine attacks and neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. 5-HT 2A receptor antagonism has also been suggested to reduce the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects induced by classical neuroleptics (Balsara et al. Psychopharmacology 1979, 62, 67-69). [0009] Psychotic patients, and in particular schizophrenic patients, are often unwilling or unable to take their medication regularly; several studies have shown that a less frequent dosing results in higher degree of compliance and thus eventually better treatment of the patients. Therefore there is an unmet need for long acting preparations of antipsychotic medicine. In particular there is a need for long acting preparations of antipsychotic medicine in non-invasive form that represent an alternative to intra muscular depot formulations in order to make change in dosing regime, frequency of medication or type of medication, more flexible. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] The inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the elimination half life of Compound (I) in human is about 150 hours. The long elimination half life in combination with affinity for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors makes Compound (I) a putative long acting antipsychotic compound that can be administered weekly, biweekly or semiweekly in e.g. a non-invasive form, such as in an instant release formulation (IR-formulation), an extended, controlled or a delayed release formulation for oral administration. [0011] Further, the inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the main metabolite of Compound (I) in human, namely trans-1(6-chloro-3-phenyl-indan-1-yl)-3,3-dimethyl-piperazine, Compound (II), and which also possesses affinity for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, has an elimination half life of about 300-400 hours. [0000] [0012] This surprising combination of a long half life and affinity for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors for Compound (I) and its main metabolite has lead the inventors of present invention to conclude that Compound (I) may be administered with a longer time interval than usually in the treatment of psychosis. Accordingly, it is anticipated that Compound (I) can be administered once weekly, twice weekly (semiweekly), or every second week (biweekly) in maintenance treatment of psychosis as well as in the treatment of acute exacerbation in psychosis. [0013] The inventors of the present application have surprisingly found that dosing Compound (I) once weekly at a dose between about 30 mg/week and about 45 mg/week reduces the PANSS Total Score at least to the same extend as a daily dose of 10 mg/day. This allows for lower doses to be administered to humans i.e. less burden to the entire body, e.g. the liver, and a less frequent dosing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES [0014] FIG. 1 shows the study design applied for once weekly dosing of Compound (I) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0015] As already indicated Compound (I) is a putative antipsychotic compound with affinity for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Preclinical experiments in rats using the condition avoidance response (CAR) model (Experimental procedure previously described in: Hertel P, Olsen C K, Arnt J., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002;439(1-3):107-11.) have indicated that Compound (I) possesses antipsychotic activity at very low levels of D2 receptor occupancy. [0016] In a positron emission tomography (PET) study in healthy subjects using 11 C-SCH23390 and 11 C-raclopride as D1 and D2 receptor tracers, it was found that Compound (I) induces a D2 receptor occupancy of from 11 to 43% in the putamen when increasing the dose from 2 to 10 mg/day given daily for 18 days. Such level of D2 receptor occupancy is low in comparison with that of currently used antipsychotic drugs, which in general requires a D2 receptor occupancy around or exceeding 50% to be therapeutically effective (Stone J M, Davis J M, Leucht S, Pilowsky L S. Schizophr Bull. 2008 Feb. 26). In the same PET study, it was found that Compound (I) induces a D1 receptor occupancy increase from 32 to 69% in putamen when increasing the dose from 2 to 10 mg/day given daily for 18 days. Such high level of D1 occupancy is not generally seen with current used antipsychotic drugs (Farde L, Nordstrom A L, Wiese F A, Pauli S, Halldin C, Sedvall G. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1992; 49(7):538-44.). Thus, Compound (I) exhibits a unique ratio of D1 to D2 receptor occupancy. [0017] Based on the above, it is expected that Compound (I) has clinically significant therapeutic effects in patients with schizophrenia at doses (from 4 mg/dose to 60 mg/dose) that induce only a low level of D2 receptor occupancy. This might well be a consequence of the high D1 receptor occupancy and the unique ratio of D1 versus D2 receptor occupancy displayed by Compound (I). A low D2 receptor occupancy at therapeutically effective doses will be beneficial in terms of reduced tendency to induce troublesome side effects mediated by D2 receptor blockade, including extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia. [0018] Compound (I) in a therapeutically effective amount of from 4-60 mg calculated as the free base is administered orally, and may be presented in any form suitable for such administration, e.g. in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, syrups or solutions. [0019] In one embodiment, a salt of Compound (I) is administered in the form of a solid pharmaceutical entity, suitably as a tablet, such as an orally disintegrating tablet, or a capsule. Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts [0020] The present invention also comprises salts of Compound (I), typically, pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids as well as organic acids. [0021] Representative examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphoric, sulfuric, sulfamic, nitric acids and the like. Representative examples of suitable organic acids include formic, acetic, trichloroacetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, benzoic, cinnamic, citric, fumaric, glycolic, itaconic, lactic, methanesulfonic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, oxalic, picric, pyruvic, salicylic, succinic, methane sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, tartaric, ascorbic, pamoic, bismethylene salicylic, ethanedisulfonic, gluconic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, EDTA, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic acids, theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid addition salts include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Berge, S. M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 2, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. [0022] Furthermore, Compound (I) of this invention and salts thereof may exist in unsolvated as well as in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered comparable to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of this invention. [0023] In a particular embodiment of the present invention Compound (I) is in the form of a succinate salt or a malonate salt. Pharmaceutical Compositions [0024] The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of Compound (I) of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. [0025] Compound (I) of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19 th Edition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1995. [0026] In a particular embodiment the pharmaceutical composition comprising Compound (I) disintegrates within 15 minutes, in particular within 10 minutes, such as 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes or 1 minute, as measured according to the procedure described in Remington&#39;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18 th edition (Ed. A. R. Genaro), 1990, pp. 1640-1641. [0027] The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically formulated for administration by any suitable route such as oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) routes. It will be appreciated that the route will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient. [0028] Compound (I) of this invention is generally utilized as the free substance or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of suitable organic and inorganic acids are described above. Dosing Regime [0029] Long acting antipsychotic compound, long acting preparations, and long acting preparations of antipsychotic compounds refer to compounds and preparations of compounds that maintain pharmaceutically active levels of the exogenously administered compound for more than one day, such as for a week, so that the compound need not to be given on a daily basis but semiweekly, weekly or even biweekly. [0030] The present invention relates to Compound (I) for the treatment of a disease in the central nervous system, including psychosis, in particular schizophrenia or other diseases involving psychotic symptoms, such as, e.g. Schizophreniform Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Brief Psychotic Disorder, Shared Psychotic Disorder as well other psychotic disorders or diseases that present with psychotic symptoms, e.g. bipolar disorder, such as mania in bipolar disorder, wherein Compound (I) is administered semiweekly, weekly or biweekly. [0031] The invention also relates to a method for the medical use of Compound (I), such as for the treatment of a disease in the central nervous system, including psychosis, in particular schizophrenia or other diseases involving psychotic symptoms, such as, e.g. Schizophreniform Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Brief Psychotic Disorder, Shared Psychotic Disorder as well other psychotic disorders or diseases that present with psychotic symptoms, e.g. bipolar disorder, such as mania in bipolar disorder, wherein Compound (I) is administered semiweekly, weekly or biweekly. [0032] The weekly (i.e. with an interval of 7 days) or semiweekly (i.e. twice a week with a 3 to 4 days interval) or biweekly (i.e. with and interval of 14 days) dose of Compound (I), calculated as the free base, is suitably between 1 mg/dose and 100 mg/dose, more suitable between 1 mg/dose and 60 mg/dose, e.g. preferably between 5 mg/dose and 55 mg/dose, such as between 10 mg/dose and 45 mg/dose mg, in particular between 30 mg/dose and 45 mg/dose, such as 40 ring/dose or 45 ring/dose. [0033] Accordingly, in a specific embodiment the invention relates to Compound (I) for the treatment of a disease in the central nervous system, characterized in that Compound (I) is administered semiweekly, weekly or biweekly in a dose corresponding to between 20 mg/week and 50 mg/week calculated as the free base of Compound (I) [0034] The weekly, semiweekly (i.e. twice a week with a 3 to 4 days interval) or biweekly (i.e. with and interval of 14 days) administration of Compound (I) may be for the maintenance treatment of a disease in the central nervous system, in particular psychosis, as well as for the treatment of acute exacerbation in psychosis. [0035] Maintenance treatment is designed to prevent relapse once patients have been stabilized by either Compound (I) of the present invention or by a different anti-psychotic compound. [0036] Acute exacerbation is a sudden worsening of the psychotic conditions.

[0048] 1.5 nM 3 H-raclopride (Perkin Elmer, NET 975) is mixed with test compound before addition of 20 microg of a homogenised human D 2 receptor membrane-preparation and 0.25 mg SPA beads (WGA RPNQ 0001, Amersham) in a total volume of 90 microL. The assay plates are under agitation incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature and subsequently counted in a scintillation counter (TriLux, Wallac). The total binding, which comprised approximately 15% of added radioligand, is defined using assay buffer, whereas the non-specific binding is defined in the presence of 10 microM haloperidol. The non-specific binding constituted approximately 10% of the total binding. [0049] Data points are expressed in percent of the specific binding of 3 H-Raclopride and the IC 50 values (concentration causing 50 percent inhibition of 3 H-raclopride specific binding) are determined by non-linear regression analysis using a sigmoidal variable slope curve fitting. The dissociation constant (K i ) is calculated from the Cheng Prusoff equation (K i =IC 50 /(1+(L/K D )), where the concentration of free radioligand L is approximated to the concentration of added 3 H-raclopride in the assay. The K D of 3 H-raclopride is determined to 1.5 nM from two independent saturation assays each performed with triplicate determinations."

  "negative": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] The invention pertains to an ophthalmologic apparatus such as a phoropter used for the assessment of a subject's vision in clinical environments or optometry practices. [0003] 2. Related Background Art [0004] Existing are ophthalmologic devices for performing semi-automated adjustments following an initial manual setup, as well as apparatuses allowing for the selection between manual and semi-automated adjustments. In the case of the semi-automated devices, if the adjustment process fails due to any reason once semi-automation has been initiated, the system necessitates a complete manual readjustment from the beginning. Furthermore, if manual adjustments are made inadvertently during the semi-automated process, the measurement may be rendered unusable. Additionally, for devices capable of both manual and semi-automated operations, transitioning between the two modes is often not user-friendly, resulting in a need for improved usability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] The invention aims to advance the state of ophthalmologic devices and equipment, primarily through enhancing user interaction and control. An additional aim is to facilitate a seamless transition from manual adjustments to semi-automated ones. Another aim is to ensure quick, accurate alignment and measurement processes. A further aim is to introduce an ophthalmologic device equipped with an optic component that includes an alignment prism, simplifying the construction while maintaining performance. [0006] The ophthalmologic device of the current invention includes a diagnostic optic system for optically assessing a subject's eye, a sensing unit for capturing alignment data necessary for the assessment, an actuation mechanism that adjusts the position of the diagnostic optic system in relation to the subject's eye, a manual input interface enabling user-directed control of the actuation mechanism, and a management system that controls the actuation mechanism for aligning the diagnostic optic system with the subject's eye. This system has various operational modes such as one that performs semi-automated alignments within a set range as determined by the sensing unit and another that allows for broader manual adjustments as controlled through the manual input interface, where the management system can switch between these two modes automatically based on certain pre-set events. [0007] Further objectives and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the subsequent detailed description of its embodiments. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008] The drawings illustrate the structure of an ophthalmologic apparatus in accordance with the current invention. [0009] The drawings provide a frontal presentation of an optic component inclusive of a prism utilized for detecting alignments. [0010] The drawings exhibit an exemplification of the display shown by a visual output unit. [0011] The drawings reveal the architecture of another embodiment of the ophthalmologic device. [0012] The drawings give a frontal portrayal of an optic element within the latter embodiment. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS [0013] The figures showcase an ophthalmologic device where this invention is applied, herein a hybrid system incorporating both a refractometer for determining the refractive strength of an eye under examination and a corneal topographer for mapping the cornea of the eye under examination. It is important to note that the invention is not limited to this embodiment; rather it is applicable to various ophthalmologic devices (such as tonometers and fundus cameras) where the alignment of an optic system relative to an eye under examination is essential. [0014] The rest of the document details the various components and operational procedures of the ophthalmologic device, emphasizing the transition mechanisms between manual and semi-automated adjustments and how they facilitate operation without much intervention from the user, thereby improving the overall efficiency and experience.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] This invention relates to an ophthalmologic apparatus such as an autorefractometer used for the measurement of an eye to be examined in a hospital or an optician&#39;s store. [0003] 2. Related Background Art [0004] There are known an ophthalmologic apparatus for effecting auto-alignment after manual alignment, and an ophthalmologic apparatus which can select manual alignment and auto-alignment. However, in the ophthalmologic apparatus for effecting auto-alignment after manual alignment, when alignment becomes impossible due to some cause or other after auto-alignment has been started, alignment must be manually effected again from the first. Also, after auto-alignment has been started, if alignment is manually effected without noticing it, measurement will sometimes become impossible. Also, in the ophthalmologic apparatus capable of effecting both of manual alignment and auto-alignment, the changeover between the manual operation and the automatic operation is cumbersome, and an improvement in operability is required. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] The present invention aims at improvements in the ophthalmologic apparatuses according to the prior art and a primary object thereof is to provide an ophthalmologic apparatus excellent in operability. Another object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmologic apparatus in which smooth shift is possible between manual alignment and auto-alignment. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmologic apparatus which quickly and reliably makes alignment and measurement possible. Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmologic apparatus provided with an optical element with a prism which makes alignment possible by a simple construction. [0006] The ophthalmologic apparatus according to the present invention for achieving the above objects is an ophthalmologic apparatus comprising a measuring optical system which optically measures an eye to be examined, a detection system which detects alignment information of the eye for the measurement, a driving mechanism which moves the measuring optical system relative to the eye, an operating device which allows an operator to manually control the driving mechanism in order to move the measuring optical system, and a controller which controls the driving mechanism to perform alignment of the measuring optical system with respect to the eye, with a plurality of modes including a first mode executing automatic alignment within a predetermined range based on the alignment information of the detection system and a second mode executing manual alignment within a range broader than the predetermined range based on the operation of the operation device, wherein the controller automatically changes between the first mode and the second mode based on a predetermined event. [0007] Further objects and forms of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of some embodiments of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008] [0008]FIG. 1 shows the construction of an ophthalmologic apparatus to which the present invention is applied. [0009] [0009]FIG. 2 is a front view of an optical element with a prism used for alignment detection. [0010] [0010]FIG. 3 shows an example of the display by a display. [0011] [0011]FIG. 4 shows the construction of another embodiment of the ophthalmologic apparatus. [0012] [0012]FIG. 5 is a front view of an optical element in FIG. 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0013] [0013]FIG. 1 shows an ophthalmologic apparatus to which the present invention is applied, herein a compound machine of a refractometer for measuring the eye refractive power of an eye to be examined and an auto-keratometer for effecting the measurement of the cornea of the eye to be examined. The present invention is not restricted thereto, but is also applicable various ophthalmologic apparatuses (such as a tonometer and an eyeground examining apparatus) in which the alignment of an optical system relative to an eye to be examined is necessary. [0014] On a base 1 , there is provided a driving mechanism 2 including three motors, and a measuring unit 3 containing a measuring optical system therein is mounted on the driving mechanism 2. The driving mechanism 2 drives the measuring unit 3 in any three-dimensional direction. On the operator side (the right side as viewed in FIG. 1) of the base 1 , there are provided a measuring switch 4 and an operating device 5 such as a track ball or a joy stick. A ring light source 6 for cornea measurement is provided on the panel of the eye to be examined E side (the left side as viewed in FIG. 1) of the measuring unit 3 , and a mode changeover device 7 is provided on the panel of the operator side thereof. [0015] On an optical path 01 behind the ring light source 6 , there are successively arranged a dichroic mirror 8 reflecting visible light, a lens 9 , an apertured mirror 10 , a stop 11 conjugate with the pupil, a lens 12 and a light source 13 for refraction measurement. On the optical path in the incidence direction of the dichroic mirror 8 , there are arranged an objective lens 14 , a half mirror 15 , a dichroic mirror 16 reflecting visible light, and a light source 17 for alignment, and the light source 17 for alignment is disposed near the focus of the objective lens 14. On the optical path in the reflecting direction of the dichroic mirror 16 , there are disposed a diopter varying lens 18 and a fixation target 19. On the optical path in the reflecting direction of the half mirror 15 , there are successively arranged an optical element 21 for alignment measurement selectively insertable into the optical path, a lens 22 , a dichroic mirror 23 , a stop 24 for cornea measurement selectively insertable into the optical path, and an area sensor (an array sensor such as a CCD) 25. FIG. 2 shows the details of the optical element 21. It is of such structure that two wedge prisms 20 are attached to the surface of a light-transmitting substrate, and has the function of deflecting and separating part of light incident on the optical element 21 by the wedge prisms 20. An actuator 26 including a plurality of solenoids is provided to retractably insert the optical element 21 and the stop 24 into the optical path. On the optical path in the reflecting direction of the apertured mirror 10 , there are arranged a six-hole stop 27 conjugate with the pupil, a separating prism 28 and a lens 29 , and this optical path leads to the dichroic mirror 23. The output of the area sensor 25 is electrically connected to a controller 30 including a microprocessor, and the output of the controller 30 in turn is connected to the driving mechanism 2. The measuring switch 4 , the operating device 5 and the mode changeover device 7 are also electrically connected to the controller 30. [0016] In the above-described construction, the measuring unit 3 is three-dimensionally moved on the base 1 by the driving mechanism 2 , whereby the alignment of the measuring optical system relative to the eye to be examined E is effected. A beam from the light source 13 for refraction measurement passes through the lens 12 , the stop 11 , the apertured mirror 10 , the lens 9 and the dichroic mirror 8 , and is projected onto the fundus of the eye to be examined E. The reflected light from the fundus of the eye returns along the same optical path is reflected by the apertured mirror 10 , passes through the six-hole stop 27 , the separating prism 28 and the lens 29 , is reflected by the dichroic mirror 23 and is received by the area sensor 25. The six positions of the received beam are calculated by the controller 30 to thereby calculate the eye refraction value. During the measurement of the eye to be examined, the fixation target 19 is presented on the eye to be examined E through the diopter varying lens 18 , the dichroic mirror 16 , the half mirror 15 , the objective lens 14 and the dichroic mirror 8. Also, the front eye part of the eye to be examined E is imaged on the area sensor 25 by an imaging optical system including the objective lens 14 and the lens 22. This imaging optical system is used for cornea measurement as well as for the alignment of the front eye part. [0017] The optical element 21 and the stop 24 are exclusively put into and out of the optical path by the actuator 26. That is, during alignment, the optical element 21 is inserted into the optical path and the stop 24 is put out of the optical path. On the other hand, during cornea measurement, the optical element 21 is put out of the optical path and in operative association therewith, the stop 24 is inserted into the optical path. Actuators 26 may be provided discretely for the optical element 21 and the stop and be individually driven. [0018] The optical element 21 deflects transmitted light in the left and right directions as indicated by arrows in FIG. 2 by the two wedge prisms 20 provided thereon. The upper wedge prism 20 has such a cross-sectional shape as deflects the beam to the right side as viewed in FIG. 2, and the lower wedge prism 20 has such a cross-sectional shape as deflects the beam to the left side as viewed in FIG. 2. The other portion than the wedge prisms 20 does not deflect the light beam but makes the beam rectilinearly travel and be transmitted. Thereby, the beam incident on the wedge prisms 20 and the other beam are separated (divided). The number of the wedge prisms need not be two, but if the algorithm of signal processing which will be described later is changed, the number of the wedge prisms may be three, four,... or one and the detection of alignment state will be possible. [0019] [0019]FIG. 3 shows an example of the display by a display 31 , and the output image of the area sensor 25 is displayed. Corneal reflected images R 1 and R 2 by the light source 17 for alignment are displayed on a front eye part image E\u2032, and further an alignment mark A is displayed. A small circle at the center of the alignment mark A coincides with the optical axis. Here, the corneal reflected images R 2 are provided by a beam deflected by the wedge prisms 20 on the optical element 21 , and the corneal reflected image R 1 is provided by a beam not deflected but rectilinearly travelling through the optical element 21. Unless the corneal reflected image R 1 and the area sensor 25 are conjugate with each other, the two corneal reflected images R 2 rotate about R 1 as shown, but if they become conjugate with each other, the line linking the two corneal reflected images R 2 together will become a horizontal line. Consequently, if three-dimensional alignment is perfect, all the corneal reflected images R 1 and R 2 lie in a straight line on the horizontal alignment mark A, and R 1 overlaps the center of the alignment mark A. [0020] The controller 30 calculates the positions of the corneal reflected images R 2 and R 1 on the basis of a signal from the area sensor 25 to thereby calculate the alignment state, i.e., the degree (amount) and direction of the positional deviation, of the eye to be examined E relative to the optical system. The wedge prisms 20 are sufficiently small as compared with the size of an opening around them and therefore, it does not happen that a front eye part image weak in reflection is reflected in overlapping relationship therewith. Also, these beams passed through the optical element 21 are deep in depth of focus and therefore, even if the distance therebetween is considerably great, it is possible to reflect the corneal reflected images R 2 , and the alignment state can be reliably recognized by calculation. The controller 30 drives the driving mechanism 2 on the basis of the detected alignment state in such a direction and amount of movement that the deviation becomes null, and executes auto-alignment. The mode in which the controller 30 automatically controls the driving mechanism 2 on the basis of the detection of the alignment state so as to eliminate this alignment deviation is called the \u201cauto mode\u201d. In contrast, the mode in which automatic control is not effected, but the driving mechanism 2 is driven on the basis of a signal from the operating device 5 is called the \u201cmanual mode\u201d. [0021] Description will now be made of sequences which the apparatus according to the present embodiment has, i.e., a sequence in which shift is automatically made between the manual mode and the auto mode and alignment is effected, and a sequence in which measurement is automatically started when alignment is completed. [0022] At the start of the alignment relative to the eye to be examined, usually great positional deviation takes place beyond a predetermined range within which auto-alignment is possible, and the display as shown in FIG. 3 cannot be obtained. Consequently at first, the auto mode does not operate and an operator manually effects alignment roughly by the manual mode. That is, the operator operates the operating device 5 to thereby move the measuring unit 3 while looking at the eye to be examined E on the display 31 , and adjusts the measuring unit so that the pupil may come into the screen as shown in FIG. 3. The controller 30 controls the driving mechanism 2 on the basis of the operation of the operating device 5 and in the meantime, the controller 30 continues the detection of the alignment state from the signal of the area sensor 25. When the detected amount of alignment deviation has come to lie in the predetermined range within which auto-alignment is possible, the controller 30 automatically shifts the apparatus from the manual mode to the auto mode to thereby start the auto-alignment operation. [0023] When the auto-alignment operation has been entered, characters \u201cALIGNMENT WORKING\u201d are indicated on the display 31 as shown in FIG. 3, thereby informing the operator that auto-alignment is being executed. When the operation confirms this indication and releases the operating device 5 , alignment will be automatically completed with nothing being operated thereafter. The way of indication on the display 31 is not limited to this, but may be by a change in the flash, luminance, color or the like of the display. Also, while in the present embodiment, the character indication on the display 31 is an indicator for enabling the operator to distinguish between the auto/manual modes, there may also be visual or aural indication techniques. For example, an indicator comprising a lamp for exclusive use may be provided at a location on the apparatus which can be seen by the operator so as to indicate the distinction between the auto/manual modes to the operator by the turning-on thereof or a change in the color thereof. Otherwise, some kind of sound may be used as the indicator. At any rate, it is important to indicate by the indicator that shift has been made from the manual mode to the auto mode, thereby informing the operator that the operation thereafter is not necessary. [0024] The controller 30 , if the sequentially calculated alignment deviation is within a range smaller than a prescribed value, judges that the alignment has been completed. Subsequently, it automatically starts the measurement of the eye to be examined (the measurement of eye refractive power and cornea shape). That is, even if the operator does not depress the measuring switch 4 , the measurement of the eye to be examined is automatically started after the completion of the auto-alignment and therefore, operability is good. During the measurement, the optical element 21 is retracted out of the optical path by the actuator 26 , the stop 24 is inserted, the ring light source 6 is turned on and the corneal reflected image therefrom is received by the area sensor 21 , and the signal thereof is calculated by the controller 30 to thereby find the measured value of the eye to be examined. [0025] On the other hand, even if auto-alignment is working, when the operator operates the operating device 5 , priority is given to the manual operation. That is, when the operator desires the manual operation for some reason or other, the auto mode becomes off and the manual mode is automatically restarted. At this time, the indicator changes and therefore, the operator can confirm that the auto mode has been released. Even if the manual mode is working, when the operator discontinue the operation of the device 5 and the signal from the operating device 5 is interrupted for a predetermined time (e.g. one second), the auto mode is automatically restarted and auto-alignment driving is resumed again. Also during the manual mode, the controller 30 continues to recognize the alignment state from the signal of the area sensor 25 , and when it judges that the alignment has been completed, it immediately starts measurement. When the operator depresses the measuring switch 4 even if the alignment is not yet completed, measurement is effected with priority given thereto. As described above, the auto mode and the manual mode are automatically changed over without the changeover operation being performed and therefore, an ophthalmologic apparatus excellent in operability is provided. Also, priority is given to the operators intention (operation) and therefore safety is high. This sequence is effective when for example, the eye to be examined has an exceptional characteristic and the corneal reflected images R 2 are not sufficiently obtained and the auto-alignment does not work well. [0026] While the sequence in which the manual/auto modes are automatically changed over has been described above, a manual fixed mode can be provided if the operator designates it by the mode changeover device 7."

  "negative": "The current invention pertains to a composition that includes a granulate and a matrix produced by a self-catalyzing process involving a minimum of two reactants that create a multidimensional structure. This composition, alongside a method for its preparation, are hereby disclosed. It is now an established medical practice to employ prosthetics such as general implants and specifically dental implants. These devices offer solutions for repairing or substituting hard tissue structures like bone breaks or missing teeth. The effectiveness of these implants greatly relies on the implant site having sufficient support. In scenarios where the bone density at the site is subpar in quality or quantity, there is a need for bone restoration and/or enhancement. Several techniques are currently available to restore adequate bone mass, one of which involves the utilization of graft materials from assorted sources that come in various shapes and dimensions. There exist systemic treatments to augment bone mass and/or density, such as those utilized in osteoporosis conditions. Despite the availability of these treatments, inducing bone formation in a controllable and reliable manner remains an issue. A method that targets local bone formation would greatly improve the management of cases needing localized bone volume increase, like during dental implant placement. Currently, bone defect remediation is done using graft materials from different origins, which could be synthetic or natural. The use of autogenous bone is one such natural graft material and compared to bone-like substances from various natural sources (including human, animal, plant, or algal origins), autogenous bone does not provoke severe immune responses and hence isn't subject to host rejection. Nevertheless, deploying autogenous bone material necessitates an additional surgical procedure for bone collection, which elevates the possibility of unwanted infections or inflammations at the harvest site and also significantly raises the cost of treatment. Moreover, the extraction of bone material may, at least transiently, result in a structurally weakened site, leading to a painful recovery phase.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to a composition comprising a granulate and a matrix obtainable by a self selective reaction of at least two precursors forming a three dimensional network. A kit and a method for preparing said composition are also provided. BACKGROUND [0002] Medical devices such as implants in general and dental implants in particular are widely used nowadays. They have become an appreciated possibility where hard tissue structures need to be fixed or replaced, e.g. in the case of bone fractures or tooth loss. However, the success of such implants strongly depends on adequate support at the implant site. If the bone mass at said site is insufficient or poor in quality, bone repair and/or bone augmentation becomes a necessity. There are different treatments applied to regain sufficient bone mass, including the use of bone graft materials of different origin, shape and size. [0003] While there are ways to systemically treat the mass and/or strength of the bone, e.g. in osteoporosis, it is still difficult to achieve bone formation in a reliable and controllable manner. However, local bone formation would greatly benefit the adequate treatment of incidents where enhancing the bone volume is only required locally, e.g. when placing dental implants. [0004] Methods currently used to repair bone defects include graft materials from different sources. The material is either synthetic or of natural origin. One natural graft material which is employed is autogenous bone. In contrast to bone/bone like material from natural sources (human, animals, plants, algae etc.), autogenous bone material does not trigger a strong immune response and is thus not rejected by the host. However, autogenous bone material requires a second surgery for harvesting the bone increasing the risk of unwanted infection and/or inflammation at this site and significantly increases treatment costs. Further, the removal of bone material leads, at least temporarily, to a weakened structure at this site and causes a painful healing process. [0005] During the last years it became more and more clear that the use of various bioactive factors improves bone repair and/or bone augmentation. It has also been shown that the method of application of such factors greatly influences their regenerative effect. Despite continuous efforts to develop methods for the controllable presentation and release of said factors, this is still one of the common problems in this field. [0006] In the state of the art, different biomaterials for tissue augmentation or release of bioactive factors have been described. [0007] WO 00/44808 discloses a polymeric biomaterial formed by nucleophilic addition reactions to conjugated unsaturated groups. The obtained biomaterial, which is in the form of a hydrogel, may be used for example as glues or sealants and as scaffolds for is tissue engineering and wound healing applications. Also said hydrogels degrade fast under physiological conditions. [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,861 discloses a method for the fabrication of a macroporous matrix that may be used as implant material. The composites are formed from a mixture of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer which is dissolved in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform and then mixed with hydroxyapatite. The latter is a particulate calcium phosphate ceramic. The material has irregular pores in the size range between 100 and 250 microns. Bioactive factors may be non-covalently incorporated in the composite. [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,382 describes injectable implant compositions comprising a biocompatible ceramic matrix mixed with an organic polymer or collagen suspended in a fluid carrier. The ceramic particles are in the size range of 50 \u03bcm to 250 \u03bcm. [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 6,417,247 discloses polymer and a ceramic matrix. The compositions are normally liquid and harden upon a certain stimulus, e.g. elevated temperatures. [0011] WO 2004/103421 describes a hydroxylapatite/silicon dioxide material having a defined morphology. A highly porous bone substitute material based on the hydroxylapatite/silicon dioxide material is also described. [0012] WO 03/040235 discloses a synthetic matrix for controlled cell ingrowth and tissue regeneration. The matrix comprises a three-dimensional polymeric network formed by multi-functional precursors. [0013] WO 2004/054633 describes a macroporous synthetic ceramic which can be used to produce granulated bone substitute material. [0014] EP 0 324 425 discloses a method for producing a medical bone prosthesis using at least one of \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate and tetracalcium phosphate. [0015] US 2004/0019132 describes methods and compositions for manufacturing a bone graft substitute. A powder compaction process is used to generate a shaped product comprising granulated bone material, such as demineralized bone matrix. [0016] WO 03/092760 discloses a structured composite as a carrier for the tissue engineering and implant material of bones, consisting of a mass of porous calcium phosphate granulates. [0017] WO 2006/072622 describes supplemented matrices comprising a PTH releasably incorporated therein, optionally containing a granular material. [0018] As used herein, the words \u201cpolymerization\u201d and \u201ccross-linking\u201d are used to indicate the linking of different precursors to each other to result in a substantial increase in molecular weight. \u201cCross-linking\u201d further indicates branching, typically to obtain a three dimensional polymer network. [0019] By \u201cself selective\u201d is meant that a first precursor A of the reaction reacts much faster with a second precursor B than with other compounds present in the mixture at the site of the reaction, and the second precursor B reacts much faster with the first precursor A than with other compounds present in the mixture at the site of the reaction. The mixture may contain other biological materials, for example, drugs, peptides, proteins, DNA, RNA, cells, cell aggregates and tissues. [0020] By \u201cconjugated unsaturated bond\u201d the alternation of carbon-carbon, carbon-heteroatom or heteroatom-heteroatom multiple bonds with single bonds is meant. Such bonds can undergo addition reactions. [0021] By \u201cconjugated unsaturated group\u201d a molecule or a region of a molecule, containing an alternation of carbon-carbon, carbon-heteroatom or heteroatom-heteroatom multiple bonds with single bonds, which has a multiple bond which can undergo addition reactions is meant. Examples of conjugated unsaturated groups include, but are not limited to acrylates, acrylamides, quinines, and vinylpyridiniums, for example 2- or 4-vinylpyridinium. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0022] The problem of the present invention is to provide a bone repair and/or bone augmentation material which has an excellent biocompatibility and mechanical stability allowing in situ repair of the bone defect and/or bone augmentation while minimizing the risk of unwanted inflammation, eliminating the need for second surgery for harvesting autogenous bone material and not bearing the risk of infection. In addition, the treatment costs are significantly reduced. [0023] The composition according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises a granulate and a degradable polymeric matrix. Several cross-linked substances are known in the art, which are able to provide a porous three-dimensional biodegradable matrix suitable for tissue regeneration and obtainable by a self selective reaction. An example for a polymeric material is PEG. [0024] In one preferred embodiment, such polymeric matrix is obtained by a self selective reaction of two or more precursors, as defined below, in the presence of water. The combination of said granulate and said matrix yields a composition having excellent bone repair and/or bone augmentation properties. The combination of said matrix with said granulate synergistically improves the bone repair and/or bone augmentation. While the matrix provides a three-dimensional scaffold, the granulate ensures a good mechanical stability. Since precursors forming the matrix and granulate are preferably mixed just prior to use, an optimal distribution of the granulate throughout the entire composition can be achieved. The precursors, which are the monomers forming the matrix, are soluble in water. It is important to note that precursors and not polymers are mixed with the granulate allowing the formation of the matrix in situ. Consequently, the aqueous solution comprising the precursors and the granulate is not viscous and can be rapidly mixed without difficulties. The rapid generation of the matrix preserves the optimal distribution of the granulate and avoids imbalances due to possible sedimentation of the granulate. [0025] Furthermore, the combination of a hydrogel matrix and granulate allows modelling of the granular putty to the desired shape, stabilizes the shape and prevents granulate migration. [0026] If appropriate, a viscosity modifier, such as CMC (carboxymethylcellulose), PGA (propylene glycol alginate) or Xanthan, can be added to ensure optimal physical properties for administration in situ, e.g. in case a relatively large amount of liquid should be added to the granules. Thus, uniform and optimal bone repair and/or bone augmentation properties are ensured throughout the entire three-dimensional structure formed by the composition. [0027] In previously known treatments, the bone filler material is applied upon mixing with non polymerizing liquids, e.g. NaCl solutions or blood. As a result, the administered bone grafting mixture may not provide for an accurate stability required for successful new hard tissue formation. The bone graft material is usually exposed to mechanical stress due to the overlying layer of soft tissue or other impacts, which can lead to the deformation, migration or even collapse of the augmentate. [0028] The composition of the present invention will overcome this problem by the combination of an appropriate filler material, e.g. calcium phosphate granulate, and a polymeric matrix, e.g. PEG, and thereby provide for controlled and safe bone repair and/or bone augmentation. [0029] Apart from the simple handling, the single components of the composition, the precursors forming the matrix and the granulate, have an excellent stability and thus a long shelf life. Advantageously, the components are stored in a dry form, e.g. as a powder, and the precursors are dissolved immediately prior to application. Alternatively, the components may be stored in solvents that protect their functionalities. [0030] Further, in various embodiments the composition is biodegradable thereby leaving space for natural bone to grow into. Again, this avoids surgery in order to remove remaining parts of the bone repair and/or bone augmentation material subsequently to the completed healing of the bone defect. The degradation products are easily excreted and non-toxic. [0031] The granulate serves on one hand as a filler expanding the volume of the composition and, on the other hand, it provides the necessary mechanical strength of the composition. Furthermore, it preferably offers a scaffold surface for bone deposition. There is a wide variety of materials which can be employed as granulate, e.g. bone materials or synthetic materials. Examples of granulate materials are autograft bone, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate and mixtures thereof. [0032] Further examples of granulate materials include autogenous bone materials such as chin, retromolar and nasal spine (all harvested intraorally), crista, iliaca and calotte (all harvested extraorally), bone/bone like materials from natural sources such as freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA), demineralized freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA; Grafton\u00ae), bovine material (BioOss\u00ae, Osteograph\u00ae, Navigraft\u00ae, Osteograft\u00ae), coralline material (Pro Osteon\u00ae, Interpore 500\u00ae), algae material (Frios Algipore\u00ae), and collagens. Synthetic materials are hydroxyapatite (Ostim\u00ae), tricalciumphosphate (Cerasorb\u00ae, BioResorb\u00ae, Ceros\u00ae etc.), mixtures of hydroxyapatite and tricalciumphosphate (Straumann BoneCeramic\u00ae), bioactive glass (PerioGlas\u00ae, Biogran\u00ae), calcium sulfate and carbonated apatite. [0033] The synthetic materials provide the advantage that they are of non-animal origin, thus eliminating the possible risk of infection with human or animal pathogens, depending on the source of the natural materials, which is always present when not autogenous bone material but bone/bone like materials from natural sources are used. In addition, synthetic granulates eliminate the need for a second surgery, in contrast to the case when autogenous bone material is employed. Said second surgery can be a prominent source of complications and additional costs. Apart from the fact that sound bone structures are at least temporarily weakened, infections or inflammation may occur, further complicating the healing process of the surgery site which itself is already painful. [0034] Another advantage of synthetic materials is that its manufacturing allows for control of parameters such as chemical composition, crystallinity, and porosity. [0035] Below, precursors A and B forming the matrix are described in more detail. [0036] The first precursor A comprises a core which carries n chains with a conjugated unsaturated group or a conjugated unsaturated bond attached to any of the last 20 atoms of the chain. In a preferred embodiment said conjugated unsaturated group or conjugated unsaturated bond is terminal. The core of the first precursor A can be a single atom such as a carbon or a nitrogen atom or a small molecule such as an ethylene oxide unit, an amino acid or a peptide, a sugar, a multifunctional alcohol, such as pentaerythritol, D-sorbitol, glycerol or oligoglycerol, such as hexaglycerol. The chains are linear polymers or linear or branched alkyl chains optionally comprising heteroatoms, amide groups or ester groups. Beside the chains, the core of precursor A may be additionally substituted with linear or branched alkyl residues or polymers which have no conjugated unsaturated groups or bonds. In a preferred embodiment the first precursor A has 2 to 10 chains, preferably 2-8, more preferably 3-8, most preferably 4-8 chains. The conjugated unsaturated bonds are preferably acrylates, acrylamides, quinines, 2- or 4-vinylpyridiniums, vinylsulfone, maleimide or itaconate esters of formula Ia or Ib wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, and R 3 is a linear or branched C 1 to C 10 hydrocarbon chain, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. [0037] The second precursor B comprises a core carrying m chains each having a thiol or an amine group attached to any of the last 20 atoms at the end of the chain. For example a cysteine residue may be incorporated into the chain. Preferably the thiol group is terminal. The core of the second precursor B can be a single atom such as a carbon or a nitrogen atom or a small molecule such as an ethylene oxide unit, an amino acid or a peptide, a sugar, a multifunctional alcohol, such as pentaerythritol, D-sorbitol, glycerol or oligoglycerol, such as hexaglycerol. The chains are linear polymers or linear or branched alkyl chains optionally comprising heteroatoms, esters groups or amide groups. In a preferred embodiment the second precursor B has 2 to 10 chains, preferably 2-8, more preferably 2-6, most preferably 2 to 4 chains. [0038] In a preferred embodiment, the core of precursor B comprises a peptide which comprises one or more enzymatic degradation sites. Examples for enzymatic degradation sites are substrate sequences for plasmin, matrix metallo-proteinases and the like. [0039] In a preferred embodiment, precursor A and/or B comprises a peptide which comprises one or more enzymatic degradation sites. Precursor A and/or B can also be a peptide comprising 2 cysteine residues and one or more enzymatic degradation sites. Such precursors are described in WO 03/040235 which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples for enzymatic degradation sites are substrate sequences for plasmin, matrix metallo-proteinases and the like. [0040] In a preferred embodiment a precursor which comprises a peptide or is a peptide comprising 2 cysteine residues and one or more enzymatic degradation sites as described for precursor B can be used as a third precursor. [0041] The first precursor A compound has n chains, whereby n is greater than or equal to 2, and the second precursor B compound has n chains, whereby m is greater than or equal to 2. The first precursor A and/or the second precursor B may comprise further chains which are not functionalized. The sum of the functionalized chains of the first and the second precursor, that means m+n, is greater than or equal to 5. Preferably the sum of m+n is equal to or greater than 6 to obtain a well formed three-dimensional network. [0042] The precursors forming the matrix are preferably dissolved or suspended in aqueous solutions. The precursors do not necessarily have to be entirely water-soluble. [0043] The granulate can be wetted with the precursor solutions or suspended in a larger amount of precursor solutions. [0044] Since no organic solvents are necessary, preferably only aqueous solutions and/or suspensions are present. These are easy to handle and do not require any laborious precautions as might be the case if organic solvents are present. Further, organic solvents may be an additional risk for the health of the staff and the patients exposed to these solvents. The present invention eliminates this risk. [0045] The use of at least two precursors which form a three dimensional network by a self selective reaction can advantageously be applied in situ. This means, the composition can be brought to the site of the bone defect in the form of a liquid or paste, allowing a precise control of the amount of composition applied. The still liquid composition optimally adopts the shape of the bone defect, ensuring optimal fit and hold. Furthermore, it allows modeling of the composition to the desired shape. No further fixation is needed. The hardening of the composition can be completed within minutes, starting at the time of mixing. It preferably does not require any complicated triggering stimulus and the self selectivity of the reaction is such that surrounding tissue is not harmed. [0046] In a preferred embodiment the granulate comprises calciumphosphate, which is highly biocompatible in terms that it is inert, i.e., does not elicit inflammatory processes or further unwanted biological reactions. [0047] In a further preferred embodiment the granulate comprises hydroxyapatite (HA) and/or tricalciumphosphate (TCP). [0048] In a preferred embodiment the composition comprises a granulate wherein the weight ratio of hydroxyapatite/tricalciumphosphate in the granulate is between 0.1 to 5.0, preferably between 1.0 to 4.0, and most preferably between 1.0 to 2.0. [0049] In another preferred embodiment the content of hydroxyapatite (HA) in the granulate is at least 1% by weight, preferably equal to or more than 15% by weight, and most preferably equal to or more than 50% by weight. [0050] The mechanical strength of the composition is greatly influenced by the amount of granulate present in the composition. Good results are achieved with compositions comprising 10% to 80% by weight granulate. Preferred is the range of 20% to 70% and most preferred is the range of 30% to 60%. [0051] In a further preferred embodiment the conjugated unsaturated group or the conjugated unsaturated bond of first precursor A is an acrylate, a quinine, a 2- or 4-vinylpyridinium, vinylsulfone, maleimide or an itaconate ester of formula Ia or Ib."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to a bandage for the application of therapeutic treatments to injuries; and more specifically, to a bandage useful for applying heat or cold treatments to a specific portion of the body. [0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art [0004] It is well known that the application of heat or cold therapies provides effective relief for muscle and joint injuries. When properly applied, heat and cold treatments provide effective relief from sprains, strains, bruises, muscle trauma, and other injuries to the body. Generally, a patient seeking to apply such treatments will place ice bags, cold compresses or pads comprised of folded cloth containing ice or heat packs on injured body areas. Typically, these devices are held in place by means such as adhesive tapes, tying gauze strips or surgical dressings or by merely having the patient lie on or sit next to such compresses so that cold or heat may reach injury areas. Inasmuch as these treatments provide relief to the patient, they cause the patient to suffer from cold hands, dripping containers, tape removal, repetitive applications, immobility or the like associated with the application of such therapies. Moreover, these bandages tend to not remain in place during vigorous activity. [0005] Numerous cylindrical type wrap configurations have been proposed in the prior art for applying heat and cold treatments to an injured body part. In some instances, these devices are open ended and may be adjusted for use by virtue of fastening means on one end thereof. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,065,738, describes a cold pack for treating an injury in which a cooling media, such as Blue Ice, is encased in elongate plastic closed end cylinders and inserted in parallel pockets formed in a wrapper, e.g., made of cloth with the interconnecting cloth material forming flexible hinges between the cylinders. Straps provided on the wrap enable the application of the pre-chilled cold pack to be applied to the injured area of a person. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 5,304,216 describes an ice pack apparatus with a flexible base web and having a polymeric foam web connected to a bottom surface of the base web with at least one refrigerant housing mounted to a top surface of the base web positioned over the foam web. The base web structure is formed of various lengths and has a fastener structure arranged at opposed ends of the base web to secure the structure around various appendage portions of the body. U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,035 discloses an elastic bandage having spaced, transverse pockets permanently affixed to one end of the bandage which are configured to allow elastic flexible bags to be inserted therein. The bags are constructed of latex or a similar material and filled with anti-freeze coolant solution or a heat retaining agent. In practice, the pocketed end of the bandage is wrapped about a limb and the remainder of the bandage is wrapped around the pockets to provide support and insulation. The bandage is useful, for example, to treat ankle or joint injuries in humans and animals. [0006] In other instances, the cylindrical-shaped device may be of a continuous configuration. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 5,466,251 describes a therapeutic elastic sleeve which is formed from a wide sheet of elastic material that is permanently attached to the sides of an ice pack or other appropriate heat or coolant container. The elastic portion of the sleeve can be stretched to allow the sleeve to slip over the patient&#39;s limb and align the container with the area to be treated. The elasticity of the sleeve causes it to conform to the shape of the limb, which provides structural support to the limb and also prevents the sleeve from riding up or down, or telescoping on the limb. [0007] In yet other instances, the device is specifically designed to treat a particular body part. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,190,054 there is described an elastic bandage designed to support the face after cosmetic surgery. Openings are provided at strategic locations, such as the top of the head and adjacent to the back of the neck, in order to permit the bandage to be secured around the face of a user. These openings are provided with suitable fastening means such as VELCRO\u00ae strips, to close the bandage around the face. The bandage incorporates a number of attachment points over the surface thereof for attachment of specifically designed attachable envelopes containing a heatable or coolable fluid therein which are secured to the bandage via complementary VELCRO\u00ae strips on the outside of the bandage and on one side of the envelope. The bandage permits application of heat or cold treatment without removing the bandage from the face part. [0008] None of these prior art configurations provides therapeutic effectiveness together with ease of use and mobility. What is needed is a device which can be used to supply heat and cold therapies and which affords complete mobility to its users. Such a device should be readily adapted for use in the treatment of traumatic injuries to various body regions and should not require removal after positioning. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a bandage capable of being wrapped around a body part comprising a flexible central web being generally annular in shape; and at least one pouch affixed to the central web, wherein the pouch contains a removable temperature transference source, such as refrigerant or heat, therein. Preferably, the pouch is removably affixed to the central web. The bandage may be readily adapted for the treatment of swelling, for use during postoperative surgeries or traumatic insults to various body regions, including but not limited to chest, torso, legs, arms, wrists, shoulder, head and neck, knees, thighs, ankles, jaw, chin, lower back, knee thigh and shoulder and the like. [0010] Generally stated, the bandage has upper and lower horizontal edges and has a continuous, generally annular configuration. The bandage may be made of flexible cloth or plastic material, preferably an elastic cloth material. Pouches for the storage of cold or heat packs also made of pieces of flexible cloth or plastic material, may be fixedly or removably attached to the outside surface of the wrap structure device by fastener attachments such as VELCRO\u00ae, clips, hooks, and the like. In a preferred embodiment of the bandage, the attachment of the pouches to the wrap structure is such that the flexible cloth material is brought into direct contact with the area of the body appointed to be cooled (or heated) thereby. The pouches may be attached to the bandage either in single or multiple rows aligned parallel to the horizontal edges of the device. Optionally, the pouches may be insulated with waterproof materials, e.g., plastic, mesh, etc. to prevent leakage and may also comprise closing means such as flaps, zippers, snaps and the like to prevent cold or heat packs from falling out. [0011] In operation, the patient inserts pre-frozen ice or heat packs into the pouches, and the bandage is secured around the injured body area. The bandage may be adjusted for individual size and comfort to achieve the most effective use without slackness or tightness. Preferably, arrangement of the pouches on the bandage is such that the cloth or other material providing for maximum temperature transference is placed in direct contact with the body part appointed to be cooled (or heated) thereby. The bandage may be produced in a variety of adult and child sizes, lengths and widths for adaptation to particular body types, injuries and for greater user comfort. [0012] Advantageously, the bandage of the present invention offers the patient mobility for other matters by eliminating the manually burdensome need to hold cold or heat packs to injuries as well as the need for frequent changes of such packs. That is, patients may make facile pack changes with or without having to take off or substantially remove the bandage once it is wrapped around the injury area. Moreover, the bandage of the present invention is configured so that it stays in position during and after vigorous activity. As such, the present invention may be readily adapted for use in the treatment of a myriad of traumatic insults to various body regions, after post-operative surgeries and even to provide comfort in common colds and fevers. [0013] In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the application of the bandage to provide therapeutic cold or heat treatments which enables users to attend to injuries without repetitive ice or heat pack changes. This method advantageously eliminates frequent manual administration of such packs to injury areas and resulting inconveniences, such as dripping bags or containers and bandage removals. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0014] The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention and the accompanying drawings in which: [0015] [0015]FIG. 1( a ) shows a top view of the bandage of the present invention fully extended with a single row of removable pouches horizontally positioned along the length of the bandage; [0016] [0016]FIG. 1( b ) shows a top view of an alternative embodiment of the bandage of the present invention, the pouches being arranged so that the cloth material providing maximum temperature transference is positioned towards, and in direct contact with the body part appointed to be cooled (or heated) thereby; [0017] [0017]FIG. 1( c ) is a side view of the embodiment of the bandage shown in FIG. 1( b ); [0018] [0018]FIG. 2 shows the continuous generally annular shape of the bandage of the present invention; [0019] [0019]FIG. 3 is a cross-section showing layers of the central web and the pouch; [0020] [0020]FIG. 4 is a top view of the bandage of the present invention fully extended with a cinch band at each horizontal edge; [0021] [0021]FIG. 5 is a top view showing a multiple row pouch configuration; [0022] [0022]FIG. 6 is a front view of the bandage of the present invention secured around the head of a patient; [0023] [0023]FIG. 7 is a side view of the bandage having a single row pouch configuration secured around the head of a user; and [0024] [0024]FIG. 8 is a front view of the bandage having a multiple row pouch configuration and wrapped around the torso of a patient. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025] The present invention relates to a bandage for the application of therapeutic heat or cold treatments to injuries, and in particular, bandages having removable pouches which contain temperature transference devices therein. More specifically, the present invention comprises a bandage capable of being wrapped around a body part comprising a flexible continuous central web being generally annular in shape; and at least one pouch affixed to the central web, wherein each pouch has a removable temperature transference source therewithin. Preferably, each of the pouches is removably affixed to the central web, and the central web is arranged in relation to the pouches so that maximum transference of temperature is provided between the pouch contents and the body part appointed for treatment. Advantageously, the removable pouches permit heat or refrigerant sources to be inserted, removed, or changed without taking off the device. This affords greater patient mobility without repetitive changes of heat or refrigerant, thereby eliminating the need for frequent manual administration of heat and cold sources to injury areas with the resulting inconveniences, such as dripping containers and bandage removals. The configuration of the bandage allows the bandage to remain securely in position, even after vigorous activity. The present invention may be readily adapted for the treatment of traumatic insults to various body regions, after post-operative surgeries and even to provide comfort for common colds and fevers. [0026] The invention can be more fully understood from the following description taken in connection with the appended drawings. Turning now to FIG. 1( a ) of the drawings, there is shown a top view of the bandage broken away in the middle to illustrate a fully extended device. Broadly stated, the bandage comprises a continuous central web 4 with top 5 and bottom 6 generally horizontal edges, interior 12 and exterior 13 surfaces, and a plurality of pouches 7 affixed to central web 4. Each of pouches 7 is removably affixed to the central web 4 ; but it is within the purview of the invention for the pouches to be permanently attached to central web 4. [0027] In accordance with the present invention, central web 4 has a generally annular configuration. By generally annular is meant any configuration which forms a ring or a closed-loop-type configuration to form a continuous structure as illustrated in FIG. 2. Typically, the continuous configuration is formed by joining together opposing ends of a rectangular shaped central web by means which are well known in the art such as by conventional sewing, bonding, welding and the like. For example, seams may be formed by connecting opposing edges with a thermoplastic adhesive tape, or the like. [0028] Any material which is sufficiently flexible such that it remains intact, i.e., does not exhibit any apparent fissures or cracks, when it is wrapped around a body part may be used to construct central web 4. Typically, central web 4 is constructed of a unidimensional stretch elastic cloth such as that commonly known as an ACE\u00ae bandage, a multidimensional stretch fabric such sold under the name SPANDEX\u2122, LYCRA\u00ae, a rubber-based material such as NEOPRENE\u2122, or a polymeric foam material. Optionally, central web may comprise either a waterproof or insulated material, or a material which is both waterproof and insulated. As illustrated in FIG. 3, central web 4 may also comprise more than one layer of material, for example, an interior insulated layer 16 a surrounded by a waterproof layer 17 a. Alternatively, central web 4 may comprise a plurality of insulating layers surrounded by a waterproof layer. Preferably, central web 4 contains a plurality of openings into which the pouches 7 are inserted. The side of the opening adjacent the body part being treated is composed of material having high temperature transfer capability. As shown by FIG. 1( b ) this is readily accomplished by arranging the pouches 7 on central web 4 so that the pouches are brought into direct contact with the body part appointed for treatment. [0029] As shown by FIG. 2, central web 4 may comprise one or more single layers of material. Optionally, each layer may be folded back on itself and seamed at either horizontal edge 5 or 6 to form a double layer of material. In this instance, the seams may be formed by conventional sewing, bonding, welding, VELCRO\u00ae strip and the like, as discussed above. [0030] Central web 4 may be of any size suitable for placement around at least one body part. The bandage may be fashioned such that the circumference and width of central web 4 may be readily adapted for the area to be treated. For example, a bandage suitable for use to treat the torso of a patient would be significantly larger and wider than a bandage suitable for use to treat a wrist or ankle, and the particularities of such size requirements are known and readily available to a skilled artisan. Optionally, central web 4 may a specific geometric configuration shape to account for the varying widths of different body parts. Thus, a wrap structure specifically designed for a knee might have a trapezoidal shape to account for the decreasing size of the leg from above to below the knee joint or a wrap designed for a hand could have a hand-type configuration to permit a patient to place his or her fingers within the wrap. Preferably, central web 4 is comprised of an elastic material which is stretched to place around the area being treated and once positioned, is allowed to contract into a snug position. In this instance, central web 4 might have a generally annular shape before placement over a portion of the body, and once positioned, could conform to the shape of the area under treatment. Thus, central web 4 can be constructed to impart a radial compressive force over the encircled portion of a body part. This is particularly suitable where it is desired to use pressure together with a temperature transference device in order to treat an injury. This also confers the benefit of allowing the bandage to remain securely in position, even after vigorous activity. In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, central web 4 may have cinch bands 8 and 9 which typically, are flexible elastic straps, located adjacent to horizontal edges 5 and 6 , respectively. In this configuration, central web 4 could be placed around a body part, and secured by pulling and fastening cinch band 8 by cinch band fasteners 10 a and 10 b and cinch band 9 by cinch band fasteners 11 a and 11 b. Cinch band fasteners 10 a and 10 b and 11 a and 11 b may comprise hook and loop fasteners such as VELCRO\u00ae strips, or any other type of hook, clips, buckles, lace, snap, strap or the like which will be readily evident to those skilled in the art. When cinch bands 8 and 9 are pulled into a taught position, central web 4 will generally conform to the shape of the area being treated and will remain securely positioned during repeated movement of that area. Advantageously, the choice of material (i.e. stretch or non-stretch material) used for central web 4 and cinch bands 8 and 9 can be vary varied to account for the degree of pressure which is desired for a particular injury. [0031] The invention described herein further comprises at least one pouch 7 removably affixed to exterior surface 13 of central web 4. Pouch configurations which are contemplated include, but are not limited to, open-ended or closed jackets, pockets, closed bags and the like."

  "negative": "[0001] The invention disclosed herein pertains to a novel creation in child restraint apparatuses, specifically focusing on a system for linking a child to a caregiver. BACKGROUND [0003] The concept of connecting a caregiver to a child through a connecting medium is well-known for preventing children from straying too far and hence from getting lost. [0004] A prior design, from a non-disclosed source, reveals a means for linking a child to a caregiver. A wearable article is placed on the child, which encases a winding mechanism for a linking cord. Although functional, this system presents issues in comfort for the child due to the weighty nature of the mechanism being carried and can obstruct normal ambulation due to the cumbersomeness of the attachment on the caregiver. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] The inventive concept proposes a novel child restraint device comprising a connection system between a child and a caregiver, which provides: [0006] a securing means for wrapping around the upper body of the child; [0007] a primary ornamental unit attached to the securing means for concealing it; [0008] a handling element for the caregiver; [0009] a cord with a proximal end attached to the securing means and a distal end affixed to the handling element; [0010] a secondary ornamental unit connected to the handling element for disguising the handling element; [0011] the secondary ornamental unit is designed to be selectively positioned upon the primary ornamental unit; [0012] the handling element is design to be selectively housed within the secondary ornamental unit's inner cavity. [0013] Another framework of the inventive concept presents a unique child restraint device for creating a linkage between a child and a caregiver. This includes: [0014] a cord extending from a proximal to a distal end; [0015] a securing means placed upon the proximal end of the cord; [0016] the securing means devised for encircling the upper body area of the child; [0017] a primary ornamental unit purposefully shaped to enshroud and hide the securing means; [0018] a handling element mounted upon the distal end of the cord; [0019] the handling element envisioned for being gripped by the caregiver; [0020] a secondary ornamental unit envisaged to encase and camouflage the handling element; [0021] the cord functioning in a stretched-out disposition and a contracted disposition; [0022] the handling element and securing means being distanced in the cord's stretched-out disposition; [0023] the secondary ornamental unit resting upon the primary ornamental unit such that the cord is sheathed between them in the cord\u2019s contracted disposition. [0031] The securing means consists of a framework with shoulder bands stretching over the upper limbs of the child. [0033] The handling element may take the form of a circular band materialized from malleable substances. [0035] The securing means is ideally a framework with shoulder bands arching over the upper limbs of the child, inclusive of a winding mechanism for the cord which is camouflaged by the primary ornamental unit, carried by the framework near the child's dorsal side. [0036] In cases where the winding mechanism is biased for winding the cord, it is ideal to have a locking apparatus that selectively impedes the rotation of the winding mechanism. [0039] Preferrably, the primary ornamental unit is considerably larger in size compared to the secondary ornamental unit for better concealing purposes. [0049] A fastening system planned to position the secondary ornamental unit upon the primary ornamental unit when the cord is in a contracted disposition. [0051] The fastening system might involve engaging loop and hook fasteners positioned on both ornamental units. [0052] Alternatively, the fastening system could involve attachments on the secondary ornamental unit devised to attach at multiple points on the primary ornamental unit. [0053] In other designs, the secondary ornamental unit could have an empty interior for the handling element's confinement and an aperture intended to accommodate the handling element in the stretched-out disposition, wherein the handling element is designed to be enclosed within the hollow interior by a closing mechanism intended to seal the second opening on the secondary ornamental unit when in the contracted position. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0068] The drawings accompanying this description illustrate a specialized device for safely connecting a child to a caregiver, the device particularly advantageous for tethering a child to a parent or guardian.\n",
  "pos": "[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. parent application Ser. No. 11/445,282, filed Jun. 2, 2006, and claims foreign priority benefits from Canadian Patent Application 2,259,858 filed Dec. 1, 2005. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a child safety device, and more particularly relates to a device for tethering a child to an adult. BACKGROUND [0003] The use of a tether between a parent and child is known to prevent children from wandering too far from a parent and accordingly prevent the child from being lost. [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,772 to Kaufmann et al discloses an example of a tether for being coupled between a child and adult. A first belt is secured about the child and supports a reel thereon upon which a tether is wound. A first toy surrounds and disguises the reel. At an opposing end of the tether, a second belt is provided for securement about the waist of the adult. A second toy is coupled to the belt for covering the second end of the tether. This device however is particularly uncomfortable for the child which must carry the large bulky weight of the reel about their waist. Furthermore the attachment to the adult is similarly large and bulky so as to act as an obstruction to normal walking motion. The waist belt is poorly disguised because the toy used for decoration is coupled between the tether and the belt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a child safety device for tethering a child to an adult, the device comprising: [0006] an attachment mechanism for securement about a torso of the child; [0007] a first decorative body secured to the attachment mechanism for disguising the attachment mechanism; [0008] an anchor for being carried by the adult; [0009] a tether having a first end coupled to the attachment mechanism and a second end connected to the anchor; and [0010] a second decorative body attached to the anchor for disguising the anchor; [0011] the second decorative body being arranged for being selectively supported on the first decorative body; and [0012] the anchor being selectively storable within a hollow interior of the second decorative body.

[0066] FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the device according to FIG. 12 in which the storage compartment is open and the tether is in the extended position. [0067] In the drawings like characters of reference indicate corresponding parts in the different figures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0068] Referring to the accompanying figures there is illustrated a child safety device generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The device 10 is particularly suited for tethering a child to an adult, for example a parent or guardian. [0069] The device 10 includes an attachment mechanism 12 in the form of harness for securement about a torso of the child. The harness includes two shoulder straps 14 which are adjustable in length for being snugly secured about the shoulders of the child similarly to a conventional backpack and a chest strap 15 for joining the shoulder straps across a chest of the child. A waist strap 13 is also provided for securement about the waist of the child. The harness carries a storage chamber 16 on the back of the child to which the shoulder straps 14 are attached. [0070] A reel 18 is supported within the chamber 16 and supports a tether 20 thereon. The tether is anchored at its first end on the reel of the attachment mechanism so that the tether may be wound onto the reel from an extended position in which a second end 22 of the tether is spaced apart from the reel and the tether is at least partly unwound from the reel as shown in FIG. 3 , and a retracted position in which the second end of the tether is adjacent the reel and the tether is substantially fully wound on the reel as shown in FIG. 2. The reel is configured to be biased in a winding direction for winding the tether onto the reel into the retracted position. An automatic lock mechanism 21 selectively restricts rotation of the reel in the winding direction to retract the tether until a release button 23 is depressed for selectively releasing the automatic lock. [0071] The second end 22 of the tether 18 is coupled to an anchor 24. The anchor 24 comprises a loop of flexible material, for example elastic, but which has a fixed prescribed diameter in an unstretched position thereof. The loop is suitably sized for being supported about a wrist of the adult in use and accordingly has a preferred internal diameter of 3 to 4 inches. [0072] A first decorative body 26 (or first decorative item) is supported on the harness of the attachment mechanism for disguising both the harness and more particularly for disguising the reel supported within the storage chamber 16 thereof. The first decorative body 26 generally comprises a plush toy which is suitable stuffed with resilient material to provided a soft and aesthetically pleasing toy for the child to play with when the harness is removed from a child. [0073] A second decorative body 28 (or second decorative item) is supported on the second end 22 of the tether 18 and serves to couple the anchor 24 to the tether. The first decorative body 26 is plural times larger then the second decorative body which is intended to be blended into the first decorative body when supported thereon. The second decorative body 28 includes an internal storage area 27 defined by a hollow interior of the body and which is accessible through an opening having a closure member 29 for selectively closing the opening. The anchor 24 is connected to the tether internally within the internal storage area 27 so that the anchor 24 can be stored in the area and enclosed therein by the closure member 29 as desired. [0074] The first and second decorative bodies have a matching theme but differ in particular design. The second body 28 in particular is much smaller but remains compatible with the design of the first body. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 , the second decorative body comprises a dog bone which is received within the mouth of a dog forming the first decorative body so that second decorative body is blended into and disguised on the surface of the first decorative body in the retracted position of the tether. In the example of FIGS. 4 and 5 , the first body comprises a bumble bee for being disguised in a perching position on a flower forming the first decorative body. [0075] As shown in further examples, in FIGS. 6 and 7 , the second decorative body comprises a fly which is retracted into the mouth of a frog comprising the first decorative body. In this instance, the tether may also be disguised as a frog&#39;s tongue. As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 , the second decorative body may comprise a smaller version of the first decorative body to resemble a similar parent and child combination, but representative of animals or insects instead. As shown in a further example in FIGS. 10 and 11 , the first and second decorative bodies may instead comprise two types of animals which are known to be in a similar children&#39;s tale, for example the turtle and the hare. [0076] In use, the harness of the attachment mechanism 12 is secured about the torso of the child by extending the shoulder straps 14 over the shoulders of the child and tightening the straps in a manner similar to a conventional backpack. The first decorative body and the reel received therein are supported on the back of the child with the tether initially wound onto the reel in a retracted position. In the retracted position, a portion of the second decorative body is received within a mating recess 30 of the first decorative body so that the tether is fully covered by the first decorative body in the retracted position. The second decorative is thus disguised within the first decorative body by blending onto the surface thereof due to the compatible nature of the disguises of the first and second decorative bodies. Storing the anchor 24 within the internal storage area of the second decorative body further disguises the device when not in use. [0077] When it is desired to tether the child to the adult, the adult simply pulls the second decorative body away from the first decorative body and the anchor 24 is removed from the internal storage area of the second decorative body. The adult grasps the second end of the tether or the second decorative body to remain tethered to the child. If desired the adult may position their wrist through the loop forming the anchor for added securement to the child. The release button 23 is located adjacent a rear side of the first decorative body, opposite the harness so as to be out the reach of the child. [0078] Turning now to FIGS. 12 and 13 , a further embodiment of the child safety device 10 is illustrated. In this embodiment, the device is arranged similar to previous embodiments in that there is provided a tether 20 extending between first and second ends in which an attachment mechanism 12 is mounted on the first end of the tether and an anchor 24 is mounted on a second end of the tether. The attachment mechanism is again arranged for securement about a torso of the child while the anchor comprises a loop arranged for securement by the adult, about the wrist for example. Also similar to the previous embodiments, a first decorative body 26 is provided for surrounding and concealing the attachment mechanism 12 while a second decorative body 28 is provided which is arranged to surround and conceal the anchor 24. The attachment mechanism 12 again comprises a storage compartment 16 housing a reel 18 therein upon which the tether is wound in a retracted position. The tether communicates through a tether opening 40 in the second body similar to previous embodiments for communication between the reel 18 within the storage chamber 16 and the anchor which is separate from the first decorative body 26. [0079] The storage chamber 16 houses the reel in a lower portion thereof, while an upper portion of the chamber 16 is provided for storage of various accessories and the like. A first opening 42 is provided in the first decorative body 26 to provide access to the interior of the storage chamber 16 for storage of items therein. The first opening 42 is fully independent of the tether opening receiving the tether therethrough. A first closure member 44 in the form of mating hook and loop fasteners for example is provided on the first decorative body for selectively enclosing the first opening 42. [0080] Similar to the first embodiment, the second decorative body 28 includes a hollow interior 46 within which the anchor 24 is secured to the second end of the tether. A second opening 48 is provided on the second decorative body for access to the hollow interior for accessing the anchor 24 which is arranged to be received through the second opening in use."

  "negative": "[0001] The subject matter described in this document is centered around an innovation concerning an apparatus dedicated to enhancing juvenile security, specifically an apparatus for linking a juvenile to a supervising individual. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART [0003] The practice of linking a supervising individual to a juvenile is recognized for its capability to deter juveniles from straying beyond a designated perimeter, thereby averting situations where the juvenile could become misplaced. [0004] An existing invention, disclosed under an alternate patent number, presents a model of this apparatus that enables connection between a juvenile and a supervising individual. This model encompasses a supportive structure to be worn by the juvenile with an integrated spool for coiling a linking cord. A playful element conceals the spool. On the contrary end of the linking cord, a corresponding supportive structure is designed for the supervising individual. However, this configuration tends to be cumbersome for the juvenile due to the significant mass of the spool, and similarly encumbers the supervising individual, potentially hindering typical ambulation. The concealment of the linking mechanism is also not optimal due to the apparent positioning of the playful element. OVERVIEW [0005] The invention discloses an apparatus for linking a juvenile to a supervising individual that includes: [0006] a securing arrangement for encircling the upper body of the juvenile; [0007] a first ornamental element attached to the securing arrangement for concealing it; [0008] a handle for the supervising individual to carry; [0009] a cord linking the securing arrangement and the handle; [0010] a second ornamental element attached to the handle for its concealment; [0011] the second ornamental element is designed to rest selectively on top of the first ornamental element; [0012] the handle can be optionally concealed within an internal cavity of the second ornamental element. [0013] In another embodiment, the apparatus includes: [0014] a cord with two ends; [0015] a connecting arrangement on the first end of the cord; [0016] the connecting arrangement designed for encircling the upper body of the juvenile; [0017] a first ornamental element designed to encompass and hide the connecting arrangement; [0018] a handle on the opposite end of the cord; [0019] the handle designed for being carried by the supervising individual; [0020] a second ornamental element designed to encompass and hide the handle; [0021] the cord capable of being in an extended or retracted state; [0022] in the extended state, the handle and connecting arrangement are at a distance from one another; [0031] the connecting arrangement includes a supportive harness featuring straps for placement over the juvenile's shoulders. [0033] The handle may include a loop made from a pliable material. [0035] The connecting arrangement comprises a harness with straps for the juvenile's shoulders, including a spool for the cord concealed by the first ornamental element. [0036] The spool is designed to reel in the cord, and features a locking mechanism to intermittently prevent spooling. [0038] Comparatively, the first ornamental element is larger than the second for effective concealment of the spool. [0039] In a further design, the apparatus consists of: [0040] a cord with distinct ends; [0041] a connecting arrangement on one end; [0047] the cord capable of operating in an extended or retracted position; [0049] a fastening system to hold the second ornamental element atop the first when in the retracted position. [0051] The fastening system includes elements on the first and second ornamental elements for engagement. [0052] In an embodiment, the second ornamental element has an internal cavity for securing the handle and an entry point to allow the handle to extend, with a cover to enclose the cavity when retracted. [0053] Other designs may feature: [0054] a compartment within the first ornamental element, accessible via an opening; [0055] a closure for the aforementioned opening; [0056] an internal cavity within the second ornamental element for handle storage; and [0057] a separate closure for the secondary opening. DEPICTIONS OF THE DESIGNS [0059] Exhibit A: A diagrammatic overview of the juvenile security apparatus components. [0061] In the sketches, correspondent elements across different versions are denoted with like symbols. COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION [0068] Referring to the illustrations, the juvenile security apparatus, designated by the numeral 10, is optimally fashioned for linking a juvenile to a supervising individual, such as a parent or caretaker. [0069] The apparatus 10 includes a securing arrangement 12 configured as a harness to encircle the juvenile's upper body. The apparatus may also incorporate adjustable shoulder straps 14 for a snug fit similar to a customary backpack. [0070] Incorporated within the securing arrangement is a spool 18 upon which a cord 20 is wound. The cord is designed to connect from the spool to a handle carried by the supervising individual, capable of extending or retracting as required. The spool features an unwinding restraint mechanism 21, activated by a release component 23 for retraction control. [0071] A handle 24 at the cord's extremity is structured as a loop from a stretchable substance but retains a set dimension when not stretched. The loop is adequately sized for the supervising individual's wrist, typically 3 to 4 inches in diameter. [0072] A first ornamental enclosure 26 is mounted onto the harness for both aesthetic appearance and to obscure the spool and cord mechanism. The first enclosure typically resembles a plush plaything filled with soft materials, allowing the juvenile to engage with it when not worn. [0073] A second enclosure 28 is placed on the cord's extremity to connect the handle 24 to the cord. The first enclosure is considerably larger than the second, which is crafted to merge into the first when placed upon it. The second enclosure features an accessible internal storage via an opening closed by a cover 29, allowing the handle to be stowed and concealed when the apparatus is not in operation. [0075] As shown by the figures, the second enclosure mimics a dog bone blending into a larger dog-shaped first enclosure when the cord is retracted. Other illustrated examples include incorporating designs such as bees, frogs, or turtles that are sympathetic with childhood stories. [0076] When donning, the juvenile's harness is affixed around the body, with the cord initially retracted. The supervising individual then extracts the handle from the second enclosure and grasps it to link with the juvenile. The release component 23, situated out of the juvenile's reach, permits controlled extension of the cord.\n",
  "pos": "[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. parent application Ser. No. 11/445,282, filed Jun. 2, 2006, and claims foreign priority benefits from Canadian Patent Application 2,259,858 filed Dec. 1, 2005. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a child safety device, and more particularly relates to a device for tethering a child to an adult. BACKGROUND [0003] The use of a tether between a parent and child is known to prevent children from wandering too far from a parent and accordingly prevent the child from being lost. [0004] U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,772 to Kaufmann et al discloses an example of a tether for being coupled between a child and adult. A first belt is secured about the child and supports a reel thereon upon which a tether is wound. A first toy surrounds and disguises the reel. At an opposing end of the tether, a second belt is provided for securement about the waist of the adult. A second toy is coupled to the belt for covering the second end of the tether. This device however is particularly uncomfortable for the child which must carry the large bulky weight of the reel about their waist. Furthermore the attachment to the adult is similarly large and bulky so as to act as an obstruction to normal walking motion. The waist belt is poorly disguised because the toy used for decoration is coupled between the tether and the belt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a child safety device for tethering a child to an adult, the device comprising: [0006] an attachment mechanism for securement about a torso of the child; [0007] a first decorative body secured to the attachment mechanism for disguising the attachment mechanism; [0008] an anchor for being carried by the adult; [0009] a tether having a first end coupled to the attachment mechanism and a second end connected to the anchor; and [0010] a second decorative body attached to the anchor for disguising the anchor; [0011] the second decorative body being arranged for being selectively supported on the first decorative body; and [0012] the anchor being selectively storable within a hollow interior of the second decorative body.

[0036] When the reel is biased in a winding direction for winding the tether onto the reel, preferably there is provided a lock mechanism which selectively restricts rotation of the reel in the winding direction. [0037] A release button for selectively releasing the lock mechanism is preferably located adjacent a rear side of the first decorative body, opposite the harness. [0038] Preferably, the first decorative body is plural times larger than the second decorative body for disguising the reel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0068] Referring to the accompanying figures there is illustrated a child safety device generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The device 10 is particularly suited for tethering a child to an adult, for example a parent or guardian. [0069] The device 10 includes an attachment mechanism 12 in the form of harness for securement about a torso of the child. The harness includes two shoulder straps 14 which are adjustable in length for being snugly secured about the shoulders of the child similarly to a conventional backpack and a chest strap 15 for joining the shoulder straps across a chest of the child. A waist strap 13 is also provided for securement about the waist of the child. The harness carries a storage chamber 16 on the back of the child to which the shoulder straps 14 are attached. [0070] A reel 18 is supported within the chamber 16 and supports a tether 20 thereon. The tether is anchored at its first end on the reel of the attachment mechanism so that the tether may be wound onto the reel from an extended position in which a second end 22 of the tether is spaced apart from the reel and the tether is at least partly unwound from the reel as shown in FIG. 3 , and a retracted position in which the second end of the tether is adjacent the reel and the tether is substantially fully wound on the reel as shown in FIG. 2. The reel is configured to be biased in a winding direction for winding the tether onto the reel into the retracted position. An automatic lock mechanism 21 selectively restricts rotation of the reel in the winding direction to retract the tether until a release button 23 is depressed for selectively releasing the automatic lock. [0071] The second end 22 of the tether 18 is coupled to an anchor 24. The anchor 24 comprises a loop of flexible material, for example elastic, but which has a fixed prescribed diameter in an unstretched position thereof. The loop is suitably sized for being supported about a wrist of the adult in use and accordingly has a preferred internal diameter of 3 to 4 inches. [0072] A first decorative body 26 (or first decorative item) is supported on the harness of the attachment mechanism for disguising both the harness and more particularly for disguising the reel supported within the storage chamber 16 thereof. The first decorative body 26 generally comprises a plush toy which is suitable stuffed with resilient material to provided a soft and aesthetically pleasing toy for the child to play with when the harness is removed from a child. [0073] A second decorative body 28 (or second decorative item) is supported on the second end 22 of the tether 18 and serves to couple the anchor 24 to the tether. The first decorative body 26 is plural times larger then the second decorative body which is intended to be blended into the first decorative body when supported thereon. The second decorative body 28 includes an internal storage area 27 defined by a hollow interior of the body and which is accessible through an opening having a closure member 29 for selectively closing the opening. The anchor 24 is connected to the tether internally within the internal storage area 27 so that the anchor 24 can be stored in the area and enclosed therein by the closure member 29 as desired. [0074] The first and second decorative bodies have a matching theme but differ in particular design. The second body 28 in particular is much smaller but remains compatible with the design of the first body. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 , the second decorative body comprises a dog bone which is received within the mouth of a dog forming the first decorative body so that second decorative body is blended into and disguised on the surface of the first decorative body in the retracted position of the tether. In the example of FIGS. 4 and 5 , the first body comprises a bumble bee for being disguised in a perching position on a flower forming the first decorative body. [0075] As shown in further examples, in FIGS. 6 and 7 , the second decorative body comprises a fly which is retracted into the mouth of a frog comprising the first decorative body. In this instance, the tether may also be disguised as a frog&#39;s tongue. As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 , the second decorative body may comprise a smaller version of the first decorative body to resemble a similar parent and child combination, but representative of animals or insects instead. As shown in a further example in FIGS. 10 and 11 , the first and second decorative bodies may instead comprise two types of animals which are known to be in a similar children&#39;s tale, for example the turtle and the hare. [0076] In use, the harness of the attachment mechanism 12 is secured about the torso of the child by extending the shoulder straps 14 over the shoulders of the child and tightening the straps in a manner similar to a conventional backpack. The first decorative body and the reel received therein are supported on the back of the child with the tether initially wound onto the reel in a retracted position. In the retracted position, a portion of the second decorative body is received within a mating recess 30 of the first decorative body so that the tether is fully covered by the first decorative body in the retracted position. The second decorative is thus disguised within the first decorative body by blending onto the surface thereof due to the compatible nature of the disguises of the first and second decorative bodies. Storing the anchor 24 within the internal storage area of the second decorative body further disguises the device when not in use. [0077] When it is desired to tether the child to the adult, the adult simply pulls the second decorative body away from the first decorative body and the anchor 24 is removed from the internal storage area of the second decorative body. The adult grasps the second end of the tether or the second decorative body to remain tethered to the child. If desired the adult may position their wrist through the loop forming the anchor for added securement to the child. The release button 23 is located adjacent a rear side of the first decorative body, opposite the harness so as to be out the reach of the child. [0078] Turning now to FIGS. 12 and 13 , a further embodiment of the child safety device 10 is illustrated. In this embodiment, the device is arranged similar to previous embodiments in that there is provided a tether 20 extending between first and second ends in which an attachment mechanism 12 is mounted on the first end of the tether and an anchor 24 is mounted on a second end of the tether. The attachment mechanism is again arranged for securement about a torso of the child while the anchor comprises a loop arranged for securement by the adult, about the wrist for example. Also similar to the previous embodiments, a first decorative body 26 is provided for surrounding and concealing the attachment mechanism 12 while a second decorative body 28 is provided which is arranged to surround and conceal the anchor 24. The attachment mechanism 12 again comprises a storage compartment 16 housing a reel 18 therein upon which the tether is wound in a retracted position. The tether communicates through a tether opening 40 in the second body similar to previous embodiments for communication between the reel 18 within the storage chamber 16 and the anchor which is separate from the first decorative body 26. [0079] The storage chamber 16 houses the reel in a lower portion thereof, while an upper portion of the chamber 16 is provided for storage of various accessories and the like. A first opening 42 is provided in the first decorative body 26 to provide access to the interior of the storage chamber 16 for storage of items therein. The first opening 42 is fully independent of the tether opening receiving the tether therethrough. A first closure member 44 in the form of mating hook and loop fasteners for example is provided on the first decorative body for selectively enclosing the first opening 42. [0080] Similar to the first embodiment, the second decorative body 28 includes a hollow interior 46 within which the anchor 24 is secured to the second end of the tether. A second opening 48 is provided on the second decorative body for access to the hollow interior for accessing the anchor 24 which is arranged to be received through the second opening in use."

These mechanisms are pertinent for non-invasive pressure estimation in various medical scenarios. The measurement occurs externally and is communicated through a gas-based transport route consisting of a tube to a measuring device located remotely. This process is affected by multiple factors including the tube\u2019s length, diameter, structure, material elasticity, and the gas\u2019s composition. These factors introduce different resonances and energy loss during signal transmission, leading to considerable alteration of the original signal. To address this, the calibration system employs internal signal characteristics and historical statistical data to compute correction factors. This innovative approach avails a robust and cost-effective means of real-time calibration that is less susceptible to signal interference and easy to execute without intricate devices or recalibration routines.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a national Phase Patent Application of International Application Number PCT/DE01/03719, filed on Sep. 25, 2001, which claims priority of German Patent Application Number 100 49 734.9, filed on Sep. 28, 2000. BACKGROUND The invention relates to a method for determining, monitoring and updating correction data for correcting measured value distortions and for calibrating liquid-filled transmission systems. Liquid-filled transmission systems may be used for invasive intra-arterial and intravenous pressure measurement in cardiology, intensive care medicine and anaesthesia. In these systems the pressure measurement takes place in the body of a patient and is transmitted via the liquid-filled transmission system formed as a catheter to a pressure transducer arranged outside the body of the patient. As a function of the length, cross-section, construction, the elastic material properties of the catheter and the composition of the liquid located in the catheter, various resonances, dampings and energy losses of the measured value of the pressure detected as a signal from the patient at the end of the catheter inside the body occur and lead to substantial distortions of this signal from the patient owing to the fluid-filled transmission system. These distortions do not allow any quantitative analysis of the signals from the patient and impair the qualitative interpretation of the diagnosis and monitoring. To avoid distortions of the signals from the patient owing to the liquid-filled transmission system pressure measuring transducers known as tip pressure sensors were arranged at the tip of the catheter serving as the liquid-filled transmission system and the signal detected from the patient converted into an electrical signal and guided from the body of the patient via an electrical line. Tip pressure sensors of this type are very expensive, however, and only available to a limited extent with respect to their shape and size. A method for computer correction of measured value distortions by the liquid-filled transmission system in the transmission of a signal from the patient measured inside the body of a patient is known from DE 1 982 208 844 A1. In this reference the electrical signal from the (distorted) signal from the patient emitted by the external pressure transducer is guided through an analogue/digital transducer and the digitalised signal emitted is analysed in a signal analysis and processing unit operating on the basis of a digital Fourier analysis and carrying out a beat by beat analysis of the digitalised signal. The analysed signal is then linked with empirically determined correction data called up from a correction data record matrix or as a correction data record vector and output as Fourier coefficients. The signal corrected by the signal analysis and processing unit is finally guided to an output and/or evaluation unit. The correction data record required for this known method can be determined inter alia from a reference pressure measurement. In order to determine the transmission function, instead of the unknown measured signal, here an artificially generated known test pressure signal can be input as the reference signal, from the distortion of which the properties of the transmission system can then be concluded. One possibility is to obtain a calibration data record from a calibrator arranged on the catheter tip, but this necessitates the maintenance of sterile conditions, causes awkward handling and means that changes in the transmission function have to be taken into account as, for example, the catheter guided to the pressure measuring site and calibrator is rinsed, medication is supplied via the catheter and so-called \u201cmicrobubbles\u201d change the transmission function. If such changes take place, recalibration is required which, however, is not easy to carry out in the case of a horizontally located catheter, in other words in a catheter located in the body of the patient. A further possibility is to obtain a correction data record from the transmission function by means of an external calibration signal. For this purpose a calibration signal in the form of a jump signal, a pressure impact or a noise is transmitted at the side of the catheter remote from the measuring position, in other words outside the body of the patient, and the inherent oscillation produced in the process is used to calculate the correction data record. However, a plurality of problems occur in this type of determination of the transmission function by means of an external calibration signal. On the one hand, the calibration signal, i.e. the jump signal, the pressure impact or the noise have to be generated very precisely and in a reproducible manner and this necessitates measurements over a fairly long time period owing to the inconstant measuring behaviour of the transmission system and therefore cannot be implemented, for example in a hospital, owing to the high time and training input. On the other hand, use of an automatic mechanical device mounted to the pressure transducer, is very expensive and moreover, as a mechanical precision part, required special servicing for setting up and maintenance. There is the additional problem of signal separation during calibration in a horizontal catheter, as otherwise the measured jump response to a jump signal by the actual signal from the patient, for example a blood pressure signal is too greatly distorted and therefore incorrect correction data records are determined. The resultant dependency of the instant of the resolution of the jump signal, impact on the system or noise substantially restricts the reproducibility and causes substantial effort in particular in the case of irregular signals from the patient. A method for reducing the noise in an ECG signal is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,195, in which a pulse sequence corresponding to the heartbeat is selected and is converted into a multi-dimensional display using a brief Fourier transformation for evaluating the time/frequency display. In addition, a multi-dimensional filter function is used on the multi-dimensional display of the pulse sequence to thus raise the signal-to-noise ratio of the pulse sequence. The statistical attempts used in the process to correct the ECG signal pulse sequence only serve to eliminate simple disturbances in the pulse sequence, however, which can be assumed to be normally distributed and of which the band width can easily be separated from the band width of the useful signal. SUMMARY One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of the type mentioned at the outset which allows continuous monitoring and on-going updating of calibration data for a correction of measured value distortions of a signal from a patient without an external calibration signal and ensures a robust correction method which is not prone to faults with respect to artifacts and other disruptions contained in the measured signals. This may be achieved according to the invention by a method with the features of claim 1. The correction coefficients for a correction of measured value distortions in the frequency range for each frequency line are determined from statistics of the signals measured at this frequency. In the process empirically checked assumptions about the corresponding statistics from undistorted signals from patients and general properties of the transmission function are used. The achievement according to this embodiment of the invention allows determination, continuous monitoring and ongoing updating of the calibration data record for correcting the measured value distortions of signals from the patients without an external calibration signal and creates an economical correction method which is substantially easier to operate and to service compared to an external calibration device and is less prone to disruptions. The transmission function in the correction method being determined directly from the patient&#39;s signal. As advantageous configuration of the solution according to this embodiment of the invention is characterised in that the correction data are determined from the transmission function determined from the signal from the patient and in that in the determination of the correction data empirically checked assumptions about the corresponding statistics of undistorted signals from patients and general properties of the transmission function are used. The solution according to this embodiment of the invention allows the following procedure for determining, monitoring and updating the transmission function in the frequency range to obtain therefrom calibration data records, without an external calibration apparatus: 1. A (pressure) signal from the patient measured invasively by conventional catheter systems serves as the input signal. A possible variation to this is the use of the derived function of the pressure signal according to time instead of the original signal. 2. A segmentation of the signal then follows, either heartbeat by heartbeat or in the form of segments of signals from the patient which are suitable for a Fourier transformation with respect to their length. Suitable means here inter alia that from a minimum length, the sign change of the first derived function of the pressure according to time under the boundary condition of a minimum amount of the second derived function of the pressure according to time is sought. A further option for determining the suitable length is that from a minimum length, the minimum of the error in approximation of the pressure signal is determined by a Fourier series cut off in the higher frequency range. Further optional preprocessing steps are a linear trend adjustment and a multiplication of the segment. 3. There follows a complex Fourier transformation of the segments matched to the segment length and a transformation by means of zero padding in the case of a fast Fourier transformation. 4. The attempt to determine the transmission function is based on segment by segment statistics of the complex Fourier coefficients determined under Item 3. The signal model for a complex Fourier coefficient S i is, as the convolution presents a complex multiplication in the frequency range: S i =t i ( m i +v i ) With t i as the multiplicative component (convolution with transmission function), m i as the mean and v i as the variable portion of the Fourier coefficient S i determined from the measurement of the signal from the patient for the frequencies i=0... maximum. The number n of the segments or the segment by segment Fourier transformation for the statistics is determined such that (m n \u2212m n\u22121 ) 2 &lt;\u03b5(mean value stability) and \u03a3(s j \u2212m n ) 2 &gt;\u03b4(adequate variance for statistics) with m n the mean value of the complex Fourier coefficient in statistics of length n and s j the complex value of the Fourier coefficient in a repetition j with j=1... n and \u03b5 and \u03b4 as selected bounds. The optimum threshold values \u03b5 and \u03b4 have to be determined empirically here. 5. The following general assumptions about the signal from the patient are therefore used as a whole or partially for determining the transmission function. A good approximation is adequate for all the assumptions: 5.1 The transmission function remains constant over the time period for the statistics. 5.2 The signal from the patient contains a component which is variable even over short periods and is not strictly periodic. 5.3 The transmission function up to the first resonance corresponds to a second-order system. 5.4 The transmission function corresponds to the identity in the frequency range 1-2 Hz. 5.5 The transmission function can be ignored in the range of very high frequencies with amplitudes &lt;\u03b5 (noise virtually zero). 6. The transmission function is determined from the statistics of the form [\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) p ]/[\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) q ] or (m j ) p /m j ) q for all the frequency lines j=1... maximum and for i=1... n segments. For the parameters p and q, p&gt;q applies. Instead of mean values median values can also be used to stabilise the statistics with respect to freak values. A statistic of this type can be regarded according to the signal model as a sequence of complex Fourier coefficients. A derived sequence of coefficients with more uniform size distribution over the frequency range is obtained by complex differentiation or logarithmisation of the corresponding Fourier sequence. Furthermore, the parameters p and q are empirically determined. The special case p=1 and q=0 is permitted, for example for p=3 and q=2 it applies that with undistorted signals from the patient, the real part of the logarithm of the statistics [\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) 3 ]/[\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) 2 ] for all the j&#39;s decreased linearly with the logarithm of the frequency. A variation is the additional determination of higher-order moments and cumulants to improve the signal model by characterizing the distribution of the exciting signal. 7. The ratio of the actual statistics to the statistics to be expected in an undistorted signal from the patient or the weighted difference of these functions after logarithmic transformation is investigated to determine the transmission function. The determination of the cepstrum (homomorphic deconvolution) provides a possible variation for combination of the Fourier transformation according to Item 3 and the logarithmic transformation. 8. To reduce the noise in these statistics the following methods can be used individually or in combination: 8.1 an (optionally weighted) averaged summation of a plurality of consecutive determinations of the transmission function according to Item 7. 8.2 a slight coarsening of the spectral resolution by class formation for a plurality of frequency lines, 8.3 a flattening interpolation or use of a median or low-pass filter. There may also be a direct adaptation to a second-order system or another flat function, for example a spline function, with minimum deviation of the noisy transmission function determined from the statistics. 9. The damping coefficient and the resonance frequency or the amount of the transmission function for the individual frequency lines can be determined from the results under Item 8. As an alternative the resonance frequency can be determined directly from statistics of the form described under Item 6. This method allows an estimation of the damping. The logarithms of the mean values, for example and still better those of the medians correlate with the frequency. The gradient in the corresponding regression in the case of distorted signals from patient supplies an estimated value for the damping. The absolute amounts of the medians of higher frequencies are also smaller in the case of stronger damping. A plurality of estimated values for the resonance frequency and damping can be averaged with weighting with respect to their quality or combined by means of multiple regression models. Corresponding regression models may also be non-linear. Parameters for corresponding models can be determined from systematic in-vitro test series. Very stable and precise estimation of resonance frequency and damping can thus be obtained. 10. An iterative method with respect to items 7 to 8 can optionally be carried out to improve the results. 11. The phase can then be clearly calculated from the transmission function with the assumption of a second-order system or determined from further statistics of the form specified under Item 6, wherein the developed phase of the statistics in the form [\u03a3(s ij \u2212m j ) 3 ]/[\u03a3(s ij \u2212m j ) 2 ] in the case of undistorted signals from patient shows, in particular, a sigmoidal systematic relationship to the frequency. 12. The complex inverse of this function is clearly determined by computer from the amplitude and the phase of the transmission function determined in this way. This inverse is the correction data record for a correction in the frequency range, a segment by segment Fourier transformation of the measured pressure signals according to items 1 to 3 taking place.

For example, for the impedance at the arterial vessel system, the catheter 2 is positioned close to where the pressure or a derived function of the pressure according to time is to be measured for measurement of the isovolumic contraction force or the like. To influence the patient 1 as little as possible by the catheter 2 , the catheter 2 has dimensions which are as small as possible and consists preferably of an elastic material and is formed in a hose-like manner. Located at the tip of the liquid-filled catheter 2 is an aperture, through which, for example, pressure pulses are picked up and passed on by the catheter 2 and a line which is also liquid-filled, to a pressure transducer 3."

  "query": "What steps and conditions are critical for achieving a commercially acceptable curl in permanent hair waving using reducing agents?,",
  "negative": "In the field of permanent hair curling, the pivotal sequence can be described as follows: 1. Reduction agent's absorption into hair fibers 2. Intramolecular bond manipulation by chemical agents 3. Structural rearrangement of keratin chains within the hair 4. Finalizing the curl shape through reforming internal hair bonds. It is a well-documented fact that the rate of absorption dictates the pace of the overall curling procedure, with subsequent steps occurring nearly as swiftly as the absorption process unfolds. The key stage in acquiring a commercially desirable curl involves the strategic rearrangement of the hair's protein structure. With pH settings leaning towards the acidic range, such as between pH 5 and pH 7, external heat application becomes a necessity for proper curl formation. At this juncture, the strength of newly formed bonds remains highly vulnerable to alterations during the rinsing phase, reversing the chemical interactions that had taken place. The industry often leans towards alkaline solutions for the curling process as they tend to advance the reaction through essential stages resulting in a more pronounced formation of the desired curl pattern. Traditionally, the procedure commences with the application of a reducing solution post hair wash, which functions to weaken the hair's protein bonds. The time the hair remains in contact with this solution is generally based on the solution's pH, the chosen method, and the temperature at which the process is carried out. The ultimate aim is to wrap up the curling session within a span of one hour, ensuring both the safety and comfort of the client. Based on hair treatments previously applied, the strength of the solution and the contact time can be adjusted. Occasionally, solutions with a higher concentration of reductants are utilized either to manage difficult hair types or to accelerate the curling process. The assessment of whether the hair has been processed adequately rests on the creation of a test curl, which enables a subjective yet skilled judgment of whether the hair has sufficiently softened to produce a satisfactory wave. Subsequent to achieving the desired test curl, the solution is rinsed off, and with the hair still on curlers, an oxidizing agent is applied to set the new curl pattern in place. The procedure is completed with a final rinse, occasionally accompanied by conditioning, and then the hair is dried.\n\n",
  "pos": "This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 06/767,500 filed Aug. 20, 1985, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,791, which application is a continuation of Ser. No. 06/577,169 filed Feb. 6, 1984 now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the process of permanent-waving, or &#34;perming&#34;, of hair, the overall sequence may be expressed as follows: 1. Penetration of a reducing agent into hair 2. kSSk+RSH\u20e1kSH+RSSk 3 kSSR+RSH\u20e1kSH+RSSR 4. Rearrangement of protein chains. 5. Setting the curl by reforming cystine bonds. It has been reported in the literature that under alkaline waving conditions, penetration is the slow step, with steps 2 and 3 presumably taking place as rapidly as penetration occurs. The fourth step is critical to the formation of a commercially acceptable curl. Under acid conditions, e.g., pH 5 to 7, it has been considered necessary to apply heat to achieve a proper curl. This is because step 2 is the dominant or limiting step. Under such conditions, the hair is highly susceptible to reformation of cystine bonds on rinsing through reversal of reaction 2. Under alkaline conditions, the reaction proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed disulfide (kSSR). It is for this reason that alkaline waving solutions have been favored by the beauty industry. In conventional perming, therefore, the hair is contacted, after washing, with a waving solution of a reducing agent, normally a mercaptan, present in sufficient strength to cleave the cystine (disulfide) bond. Cleavage softens the protein structure (keratin) of the hair. Contact time depends on pH, the process used, and temperatures employed, which may be up to about 60\u00b0 C. Wetting agents or other penetrants are normally employed to aid reduction. In practice, the key objective is to complete the waving process in less than one hour, with the safety and comfort of the client foremost in mind. Hair that has been chemically pretreated may be contacted with weaker solutions and for a lesser time than normal hair. Solutions of high reductant concentration may be required for hair difficult to treat, or to shorten process time. The operator normally determines whether there has been adequate processing of the hair, or that maximum bond breakage has occurred, by formation of a test curl. This determination involves unrolling the mandrel a couple of curls to ascertain if a &#34;soft S&#34; at the diameter of the mandrel pattern has formed. This is a subjective but skilled determination of whether adequate softening of the hair has occurred, so as to produce a satisfactory wave, and is normally expressed by the operator as the time of contact of the waving solution with the hair. When adequate test curl has been achieved, the waving solution is normally rinsed from the hair, and while the hair is still set on mandrels, an oxidizing agent is applied to fix the new curl pattern. The hair is subjected to a final rinse, possibly with conditioning, then dried. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to achieving permanent waves by a precise sequence of steps which reduce the potential of damage to the hair or scalp, shorten the overall waving cycle, and insure a better curl. In its broadest aspects, the invention resides in exposing hair wound on a mandrel to the action of a reactive waving solution containing at least one reducing agent capable of cystine cleavage, for a time sufficient to achieve substantially maximum bond cleavage; followed by blotting the hair to remove excess waving solution; then applying a suitable protein flow solution to enable protein flow to the desired curl configuration (reaction 4). This is followed by oxidation using an oxidizing agent to reestablish the cystine bonds to fix the curl. Preferably, the method involves contacting the conditioned hair with a waving solution comprised of at least one water-soluble mercaptan capable of cleaving the cystine bonds, and preferably present in combination with an alkali to maintain pH at from about 6 to about 10, and present in a concentration sufficient to achieve maximum bond-cleavage in from 5 to 15 minutes, contemporaneously with penetration of the hair; blotting excess waving solution from the hair; then contacting the hair with a suitable protein flow solution, preferably comprising an aqueous solution of at least one polyvalent ion and/or a hydroxyorganic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups and up to about 4 carbon atoms at a pH of from 2 to about 10, for a period of from about 5 to about 10 minutes. This is followed by rinsing and reforming the cystine bonds through oxidation with a conventional peroxide or bromate oxidizing solution. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1-3 graphically illustrate the degree of reduction of cystine (S--S), shown by &#34;.&#34;; cysteine (S--H) formation is shown by &#34;O&#34;; and the mixed disulfides (CMTC) are shown by &#34;X&#34;. FIG. 1, in particular, is the plot of the kinetic change in hair as a function of time, using as the reducing agent an alkaline solution containing 7% by weight ammonium thioglycolate (ATG) at a pH of 9.5, which solution contains about 5% by weight nonionic surfactants. FIG. 2 illustrates the kinetics of acid hair-reduction, using a 7%-by-weight ammonium thioglycolate waving solution at a pH of 6.9 and containing 5% by weight nonionics. It will be noted that the cysteine and CMTC curves coincide. FIG. 3 illustrates the kinetics of hair-reduction, using glycerol monothioglycolate (GMTC), also under acid conditions. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate, respectively, curl maturation at onset and curl efficiency vs. cleavage as a function of time, which establishes maturation lags cleavage of cystine. FIG. 6 illustrates the dramatic difference in waving using the same waving solution by practice of the instant invention. Blotting occured at a 5-minute interval. The points after blot show resiliency at points in time after rinsing of the hair and rebonding. The solid line represents a plot for curl resiliency against time using as the waving solution, Redken CLIMATRESS\u00ae, an alkaline ammonium thioglycolate solution, in a conventional waving process. The dashed line shows resiliency produced by using an aqueous protein flow solution of magnesium sulfate and ethanol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The instant invention will be detailed by a comparison of results achieved in conventional waving and the differences realized by practice of the instant invention. As used herein, the term &#34;maximum bond cleavage&#34; is defined as the maximum fraction of cystine (disulfide) bonds cleaved during the waving process, as determined by analysis of cysteine content with time. Normally, at least 30% cleavage of cystine is required, and from about 30% to about 50% is normally obtained in a successful wave. &#34;Test curl&#34; is the visual determination of softening to produce a satisfactory wave by one skilled in perming. It is expressed as the time of contact with the waving solution. &#34;Efficiency&#34; is the measure of appearance of curl tightness by waving hair on mandrels (pegs) of predetermined spacing. It is expressed as the percentage of maximum tightness, as determined by the geometry of spacing. High efficiencies represent tight-curl appearance but not necessarily resiliency. &#34;Resiliency&#34; is the measure of regain of curl or spring, as determined by extending or stressing the curl pattern waved on pegs of predetermined spacing. The tighter the return, or regain, the more resilient the curl formed. A curl may be tight in appearance, but not resilient. The converse is also true. &#34;Mature curl&#34; is the curl pattern that is found at the time of test curl, and is expressed as a resiliency value that is commercially acceptable, compared to resiliency of accepted perm products. &#34;Protein flow&#34; is the molecular rearrangement of the keratin-protein chains to form the curl pattern for the mature curl. In contrast to popular view, &#34;protein flow&#34; is not synonymous with &#34;cystine cleavage&#34;. By &#34;hydroxyorganic compound&#34; there is meant an alcohol or a polyol containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. By &#34;polyvalent ion&#34; there is meant an ion, when in solution, having a valence of at least 2. Cations are preferably present. However, anions have also been observed to be functional. Cystine cleavage is, in accordance with this invention, an operation independent of induced protein flow. As separate operations, more efficient permanent waves are achieved in shorter time spans with less client discomfort. The nature of the perming operation is to first shampoo the hair, then to wind the hair on mandrels. There is then applied to the hair a waving solution of at least one reductant for cystine (S--S) bonds, which may be from acid to alkaline in nature. Suitable reductants include thioglycolic acid; thiolactic acid; cysteine; salts and derivatives thereof; sulfite salts and the like. With reference to the background of the invention, alkaline, as opposed to acid, waving solutions are preferably used. This is because the acid waving solution is more-or-less limited, independent of waving solution concentration and application of heat, to the reaction of step 2, whereas steps 3 and 4 readily occur in an alkaline system having a pH greater than 7. Moreover, under acid conditions, fiber swelling is at a minimum, and ionic attractions between protein side-chains are at their maximum. It is for these reasons, in part, that thioglycolicacid and similar solutions at a pH between 5 and 7 are less preferred than waving solutions of the same agent at an alkaline pH. Under preferred alkaline conditions, the reaction, as indicated, proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed-disulfide (kSSR) bonds. In addition, the protein chains bear an excess of negative charges, increasing hair swelling, which induces protein flow through repulsion. In consequence, the initial concentration of mixed disulfides is rapidly consumed, and the process normally proceeds through step 4 with attendant protein flow as determined by the skilled permer to have occurred, as a measure that a mature curl can be formed. It has now been found that substantially-maximum cystine cleavage (step 2) can be achieved using any conventional, reactive waving solution for about 5 minutes, with any excess time being created by reagent concentration, pH, temperature or hair condition. Normally, the maximum time is about 10 minutes, and cleavage is synchronous with penetration. Any time longer than about 15 minutes is unnecessary to the invention. This is because, in the practice of the instant invention, a secondary, less noxious means is used to induce protein flow, namely, the use of a protein flow solution as defined herein. As is conventional, cleavage for an acid waving solution proceeds through steps 1 and 2; and for an alkaline waving solution, cleavage proceeds to or into step 4. Independent of pH, the hair is blotted to remove excess waving solution, to maintain equilibrium of established cystine cleavage. Rinsing at this point is avoided because of reversal of step 2 to form cystine. Rather, protein flow is induced with a protein flow solution. Preferably, the protein flow solution employed is an aqueous solution of a water-soluble hydroxyorganic compound and/or a polyvalent ion, as detailed below. If the waving solution is based on glycerol monothioglycolate under generally neutral conditions, protein flow solutions described herein may be employed, since glycerol monothioglycolate is intermediate, and by the fact that it is more ionized under acid conditions, with a pK SH of 7.8 relative to a pK SH of 10.2 for thioglycolic acid. It is preferred, however, to employ a solution comprising at least one alcohol and/or polyol in combination with at least one polyvalent ion. Disrupting agents, such as urea, quanidine, amides, betaines and surfactants which aid in expanding the protein structure, may be included in the protein flow solutions employed. For practice of the instant invention, therefore, after treating the hair with the waving solution for a period of from about 5 to about 15 minutes, excess waving solution is blotted from the hair. This leaves the remainder in the fiber to maintain maximum bond cleavage for subsequent protein rearrangement with a protein flow solution. Protein rearrangement is then achieved by applying to the hair, an aqueous protein flow solution comprising at least one water-soluble salt of a polyvalent ion having an ionic charge of at least two, and acceptable toxicity. Magnesium and calcium salts are currently preferred. Salts may be used in concentrations up to solution saturation, normally in a concentration of from about 1 to about 10 percent by weight. Alternatively, but preferably in addition, there is employed at least one hydroxyorganic compound containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. It may be an alcohol and/or a polyol. Again, concentration may be up to solution saturation or to a concentration where the solution becomes hazardous to the client or to use. Illustrative but not limiting of functional compounds, there may be mentioned, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, isoamyl alcohol, propylene glycol and the like. Normally, 2-butanol is not used because of odor. Methanol is functional, but can present toxicity problems. Normally, the alcohol or the polyol is present in a concentration up to about 25 percent by weight of solution, preferably from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight, more preferably from about 2 to about 10 percent by weight. Solution pH may range from about 2 to about 10, preferably from about 6 to about 7, and may be adjusted by inclusion of alkaline compounds such as ammonia, alkaline amino acids, alkanolamines, alkali carbonates, and the like. Preferably, there are contained in the protein flow solution, wetting agents, such as nonionic, cationic or anionic detergents; conditioners, such as amino acids or proteins; polymers or water-soluble fatty derivatives, as thickeners; colorants; fragrance; preservatives, and the like. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the application of the ionic solution produces a concentration gradient, inducing the fibers to absorb positively-charged ions which neutralize negatively-charged protein side chains, causing increased protein mobility and inducing flow. The alcohol or polyol ingredient induces penetration and hydrophobic rearrangement of protein side chains further increasing thereby the propensity to flow. Protein flow is complete within a period of from 5 to 10 minutes, which is predetermined by the precise composition, temperature, and condition of the hair. In the practice of the instant invention, although two applications of solution are employed, the waving operation is faster, having a feasible maximum completion time of 15 minutes, with more repeatable and reliable results for the cleavage and rearrangement steps. Following addition of the protein flow solution to the hair, the hair is rinsed and the disulfide bonds are reformed through conventional oxidizing operations, as by application of peroxide and bromate rebonding solutions.

All establish that maximum or substantially maximum bond cleavage occurred in 5 minutes with, in the instance of GMTG, some gain in the 5-to-10-minute span. It was concluded, therefore, that in most instances, substantially maximum bond cleavage could be achieved in from 5 to 10 minutes. Control A In a controlled salon test, cystine and CMTC content of a controlled amount of hair were determined at various points in a waving operation. It established that the amount of cystine did not decrease, nor did mixed disulfides increase, with protracted contact with the waving solution. It also showed the strong influence of water on restoring the cystine bonds. The waving solution was composed of 11% by weight ammonium thioglycolate, a nonionic surfactant, at a pH of 7.0.

In particular, it focuses on an innovative approach to extract fluids from oral tissues with minimal patient discomfort during or after dental interventions, such as tooth extractions or root canal treatments. The discussion presents developments for fluid extraction directly from oral tissues, which are abundant sources for such fluids in young, healthy individuals. These methods facilitate easy access to fluids without additional surgical incisions, thereby reducing patient discomfort and medical complications. It is crucial to note that these improvements allow for the fluid to be extracted during common dental procedures, providing immediate availability of the fluids for potential uses.

No. 08,886,173, filed Jul. 1, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,859. FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for recovering bone marrow from a patient and subsequent collection and storage. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of obtaining bone marrow and bone marrow fluid from the jawbone of a patient with relative ease and minor discomfort before, during, or after dental procedures, such as the removal of impacted or redundant third molars or bicuspids for long term storage and/or for bone typing. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are a number of diseases in which the bone marrow is defective, such as aplastic anemia, some forms of leukemia, and deficiencies in the bone marrow caused by cancer treatments with drugs and irradiation. The treatment of choice for these diseases is bone marrow transplantation, provided a genetically compatible donor can be found. For instance, bone marrow transplants are significantly reducing the death toll from childhood leukemias. Bone marrow, also called myeloid tissue, is a soft, gelatinous tissue that fills the cavity of the bones. Human bone consists of a hard outer cortex and a soft medullary cavity that contains bone marrow. Bone marrow consists of stroma, or supporting tissues which have spaces packed by blood cells. Bone marrow is either red or yellow, depending upon the preponderance ance of vascular (red) or fatty (yellow) tissue. In humans, the red bone marrow forms all of the blood cells with the exception of the lymphocytes, which are produced in the marrow and reach their mature form in the lymphoid organs. Yellow bone marrow serves primarily as a storehouse for fats, but may be converted to red marrow under certain conditions, such as severe blood loss or fever. At birth, and until about the age of seven, all human marrow is red, as the need for new blood formation is high. Thereafter, fat tissue gradually replaces the red marrow, which in adults is found in the vertebrae, hips, breast bone, ribs, and skull, and at the ends of the long bones of the arms and legs, other cancellous, or spongy bones, and the central cavities of the long bones. In mammals, blood formation in adults takes place predominantly in the marrow. Because the white blood cells produced in the bone marrow are involved in the body&#39;s immune defenses, marrow transplants have been used to treat certain types of immune deficiencies. The sensitivity of marrow to damage by radiation and some anticancer drugs accounts for the tendency of these treatments to impair immunity. Bone marrow transplants can be divided into three groups according to the source of the marrow for transplantation. They are called autologous, syngeneic, or allogeneic. Autologous transplantation means that the bone marrow has been received directly from the recipient, and will be an exact genetic match. A syngeneic transplant comes from an identical twin of the recipient and will also be an exact genetic match. However, for allogeneic transplants, the bone marrow is provided by another person, and the possibility of exact genetic matching is very low. It is reported that approximately 12,000 bone marrow transplants were performed in 1992, approximately half of which were allogeneic and half autologous. Autologous transplantation has grown significantly during the past several years as improvements in procedures are made. The number of patients receiving allogeneic transplants is also rising due in large part because donor registries have increased the number of readily available donors. Advances in bone marrow transplantation techniques will likely continue to expand the use of the bone marrow transplant procedure. Generally, the recipient&#39;s sibling or parent will serve as the best source as the donor because of the high possibility of genetic matching. However, there are many cases where neither the parent nor the sibling will be a compatible genetic match for the recipient. There has been a recent increase in the use of bone marrow from unrelated donors which can provide genetic compatibility between the donor and recipient. This increase has been made possible through the existence of large bone marrow registries, such as the National Marrow Donor Program, and the American Bone Marrow Donor Registry. The drawback to these registries are the insufficient number of donors that genetically match closely enough with potential recipients to be of use. The success of the bone marrow transplantation technique depends heavily on genetically cross-matching the donor marrow cells to those of the recipient to prevent rejection. There is a significant tendency for the recipient patient to reject an allografted marrow because parts of the donor marrow will attack their new host. There is an additional hazard because immune system cells in a marrow graft can react against the patient&#39;s tissues, causing serious and sometimes fatal graft versus host disease. The ability to accept a bone marrow transplant (graft) from a donor, is dependent on the recipient sharing all of the donor&#39;s histocompatibility genes. To avoid graft versus host rejection in the past, special immunosuppressive treatment has been given. The use of monoclonal antibodies to selectively remove harmful lymphocytes from the donor marrow has been successful in some cases to prevent graft versus host disease. However, the risk remains that unless the bone marrow source is from the patient himself, an identical twin, sibling, parent, or other genetically compatible donor, that the bone marrow transplantation cannot take place because it will result in graft versus host rejection, and the failure of the treatment, and possibly the death of the recipient. Therefore, there is a significant need to collect and store genetically compatible bone marrow for use in cases where bone marrow transplantation is necessary to save the life of an individual. Because of the significant possibility that a donor cannot be found which is a close genetic match to the recipient, there is a need to collect and store an individual&#39;s own bone marrow while that individual is still healthy. If this is done, there will be a complete genetic match, and the dangers of graft versus host rejection will be eliminated which increases the success of the treatment. The collection of bone marrow for transplantation purposes is usually accomplished by inserting a needle into a donor&#39;s hip or pelvic bone. Several small incisions are made in the pelvic area, and the needle is inserted through these incisions approximately 25 to 30 times to withdrawn the bone marrow from the bones. The extraction process typically lasts at least one hour or more, or until approximately 500 to 1000 milliliters of the donor&#39;s marrow is withdrawn. The donor will fully recover in approximately a few weeks when all the donated marrow has been replaced within the body. However, the extraction process is painful and there is typically soreness around the incisions until healing can occur. Typically, the donors also feel fatigued for some time after the procedure. The side effects to having donated bone marrow can vary from donor to donor. Infection from the incision is always a possibility. Additionally, blood loss can also occur, and proper medical attention is required. It is recommended that donors routinely store supplies of their own blood for infusion during and after the extraction procedure in cases of emergencies. Bone marrow can be obtained through biopsy or aspiration from the sternum or the calvarium in adults, and in long bones, such as the femur and tibia, in adolescents. Biopsy needles for extraction of solid bone marrow are known. Examples of such biopsy needles are U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,991,692; 2,426,535; 2,496,111; 4,272,676; 4,266,555; 4,543,966; 4,487,209; 4,840,184; and 4,922,602, which show the overall structure and orientation of the components. Needles used for aspiration of liquid bone marrow are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,109. Needles designed to both biopsy and aspirate bone marrow are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,496,111; 3,587,560; 5,012,818; and 5,357,974. There is a need for bone marrow extraction techniques that avoid the considerable inconvenience, discomfort, and pain due to current bone marrow extraction procedures and aspiration methods. Therefore, there is also a need to provide a method and apparatus to obtain both solid and liquid bone marrow from a donor with minimal intrusion and pain. There is also a need for the bone marrow to be stored for later use and is accomplished with relative ease. The present invention provides for a dental apparatus used for extracting the bone marrow that includes a means to bore a hole in the jawbone of a patient and to immediately collect the bone marrow in a specialized collection means all in one system. Another embodiment of the apparatus of this invention includes a bone marrow apparatus that has various sources of solution supply and collectors for the purpose of preparing the collected bone marrow for storage, preservation, and subsequent use. The present invention provides methods and apparatus for the extraction of bone marrow from the jawbone of the donor, which will eliminate the problems often associated with obtaining bone marrow from conventional methods. It should be noted that literally millions of dental extractions of third molars and bicuspids in young, healthy adults and adolescents are performed each year. Thus, the collection, typing, and storage of bone marrow obtained during this procedure provides an immediate source of highly desirable autologous bone marrow for long-term storage. It also provides a means for obtaining allogeneic bone marrow for registry and storage in National Registries which will provide greater access for everyone to bone marrow of perfect or near-perfect genetic match to potential recipients. The invention further provides a method for providing an easily obtainable source of bone marrow, that requires no hospitalization, minimal discomfort, and provides no scarring as is common in the conventional extraction procedures. It also provides for the ability of an individual to collect and store his own bone marrow before the onset of any disease, such as childhood leukemias, which usually occurs between the ages of 15 and 30. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides embodiments directed to a novel and improved method and apparatus for bone marrow extraction. A method for extracting and collecting bone marrow from a jawbone of a patient comprises the steps of boring a hole in the jawbone to a depth sufficient to form a jawbone bone marrow extraction site, extracting the bone marrow from the jawbone bone marrow extraction site, and collecting and storing the bone marrow in a collection chamber. The method may further comprise the step of infusing a solution into a void in the jawbone resulting from the bone marrow extracting step. The solution may be selected from the group consisting of anticoagulant containing saline solution and electrolyte solution. The method may include the steps of mixing the bone marrow with a liquid to form a mixture, transferring the mixture to the collection chamber, and isolating the bone marrow from the mixture to form isolated bone marrow. The method may further comprises the steps of preserving the isolated bone marrow with a preservative to form preserved bone marrow and storing the preserved bone marrow. Another method for extracting and collecting bone marrow from the jawbone of a patient comprises the steps of: boring a hole in the jawbone to form a jawbone bone marrow extraction site; introducing a biopsy needle into the jawbone bone marrow extraction site, wherein the biopsy needle is connected to a suction source; penetrating a medullary cavity of the jawbone bone marrow extraction site with the biopsy needle; collecting solid bone marrow through the biopsy needle; penetrating the medullary cavity with the biopsy needle; breaking marrow stroma with the biopsy needle; activating a pump to aspirate liquid bone marrow from the broken marrow stroma; and collecting the liquid bone marrow through biopsy needle. This method may further comprise the step of selectively activating a valve to selectively generate suction in the suction tube. Methods of the invention comprise the steps of withdrawing bone marrow from the jawbone of a patient and collecting the bone marrow in such a way as to eliminate bone marrow aspiration pain. The method also provides for the extraction and collection of the bone marrow for long-term storage and personal banking following dental extraction or surgery. The method employs extracting bone marrow by a simple intrusion into the donor&#39;s jawbone immediately before, during, or after a dental procedure. A significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a method for extraction of bone marrow from the jawbone of young, healthy patients during dental procedures, including the removal of impacted or redundant third molars or bicuspids. This method allows for the ready accessibility of large quantities of bone marrow in multiple locations. An advantage to this procedure is that additional incisions, other than those already performed, are not necessary because access to the marrow is already present. Furthermore, because there is no need for additional incisions, virtually no additional pain or medical complications, other than that experienced by the routine dental procedure, is experienced by the patient. According to this invention, the bone marrow can also be collection during other surgical procedures, such as dental implants. The anterior mandible is an extremely safe area to obtain bone marrow without risk to any other vital structures. Another area where large amounts of bone marrow are readily available, according to this invention, is the anterior boarder of the ramus of the mandible. The method also avoids the risk of visible scarring. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the uses of bone marrow other than for storage includes use in bone regeneration procedures such as periodontal bone grafts, sinus lifts, and implant placement. Through the use of known multiplication procedures, this bone marrow can then be multiplied. Another aspect of this invention allows for the genetic typing of the bone marrow collected to be put to other uses, such as cross-typing for organ transplants in traumatic circumstances. An additional aspect of the invention is to treat the bone marrow before storage or transplantation in an effort to protect a patient from a relapse caused by undetected cancer cells. Further treatment, when needed, of collected bone marrow encompassed by this invention includes the removal of blood and bone fragments. For instance, T-cell depletion can be used in allogeneic bone marrow to remove T-lymphocytes. Collected bone marrow can also be combined with a preservative, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (\u201cDMSO\u201d) before storage and stored in a liquid nitrogen freezer until the day of transplantation. This technique, known as cryopreservation, allows the bone marrow to be preserved for a long period of time. Cryopreservation permits bone marrow extracted during adolescence to be preserved throughout the lifetime of the donor. Currently, bone marrow transplantation is not used routinely in elderly adults because of the high risk of infection caused by the use of immunosuppressant drugs in use today. Thus, the availability of autologous bone marrow high in stem cells opens the door for a wide variety of treatment options, including anemia and osteoporosis. The present invention also provides an apparatus for carrying out the method of this invention. One embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention includes a bone marrow extraction apparatus that has various sources of solution supply and collectors for the purpose of preparing the collected bone marrow for storage, preservation, and subsequent use. In another embodiment, a dental apparatus for extracting bone marrow from a patient comprises a housing, means attached to the housing for extracting bone marrow from an extraction site, and means for collecting bone marrow extracted from the extraction site. The extracting means may comprise a solid bone marrow extraction portion, the solid bone marrow extraction portion including a first and a second end, the first end being for collecting bone marrow. The extracting means may also comprise a liquid bone marrow extraction portion comprising a first end and a second end, the first end being for breaking bone marrow stroma and aspirating the liquid marrow. In another embodiment, the extracting means comprises a bur and the collecting means comprises a passage in the housing. The collecting means may include a vacuum in communication with the passage in the housing. The dental apparatus for extracting bone marrow from a patient may also comprise means for breaking up extracted bone marrow. In another embodiment, the dental apparatus for extracting bone marrow from a patient comprises a housing having a cavity, a hollow shaft disposed in the cavity and having first and second ends, a bur attached to the first end of the hollow shaft, a beveled gear attached to the second end of the hollow shaft, and a drive gear matingly engaged to the beveled gear. A first passage is defined in the housing and is in communication with the hollow shaft for passing irrigation fluid to the extraction site. A second passage is defined in the housing and is in communication with the cavity for passing bone marrow from the cavity to a collection device. A vacuum may be placed in communication with the second passage. In a further embodiment, the housing of the dental apparatus has a detachable portion, and at least a part of the second passage is defined in the detachable portion of the housing. In another embodiment, the hollow shaft has a circumferential outer surface, and a spiral cutting blade for breaking up bone marrow is attached to the outer surface of the hollow shaft. The collection device may comprise a tube in communication with the second passage and a container connected to the tube. The tube may include a valve for controlling a flow of bone marrow into the container. A source for irrigation fluid may be placed in fluid communication with the first passage. The walls defining the cavity may have ridges for breaking up bone marrow prior to passage of the bone marrow through the second passage. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following and more particular description of the preferred and other embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying FIGS."

  "query": "What are the technological advancements in electromechanical board games that simulate baseball playing conditions with realistic frequency of in-game events?,",
  "negative": "This device pertains to an interactive entertainment system. More specifically, it involves a strategy-based competitive game intended for multiple participants. BACKGROUND OF THE DEVICE Numerous electronic games have been established over time to reproduce various sports. A certain type of digital game offers a virtual representation of a sports arena for two competitors, one acting on offense, and the other on defense. Both participants use input devices which correspond to different actions and outcomes in the sport. These actions can result in various game states on the virtual arena, including those that mimic realistic sporting situations. Nevertheless, these virtual games often lack the physical skill requirements and the full spectrum of play outcomes found in the actual sport, failing to faithfully replicate the experience. SUMMARY OF THE DEVICE The objective of this device is to introduce an enhanced interactive sports game. An aim is to incorporate elements requiring physical skills similar to those used in the actual sport into the digital interface. Another goal is to create an electronic game that is user-friendly for all age groups. Additionally, it aims to offer a simulation that presents a realistic representation of the sport, providing an experience filled with the same excitement as the actual game. The presented game includes a console with input mechanisms representing sportive actions, plus various digital components that reflect events happening in a real match. The game features an integrated system to monitor and display the progress and results of each action. This system uses visual signals to inform players of the outcomes such as runs, hits, and outs. Although this device includes complex elements mirroring those found in the sport, it remains simple to manage and understand, making the game accessible to a broad audience.\n\n",
  "pos": "This invention relates to an electromechanical board game. It relates more particularly to a simulated baseball game designed to be played by players on opposing sides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Numerous board games have been developed over the years which simulate the game of baseball. In one such game of which we are aware, a baseball playing field is depicted on the game board. The game is designed for two players, one of which is at bat and the other of which is in the field. The two players have spinners, with the indicia on the in-bat spinner indicating various hit possibilities and the in-the-field spinner showing various out possibilities that occur in a conventional game of baseball. The player at bat spins his spinner and receives a strike, ball, foul, or hits the ball depending upon where the spinner pointer stops. The player in the field then spins his spinner to determine whether the &#34;hit&#34; ball is caught, dropped, etc. Various game pieces are moved around the simulated baseball diamond to represent players on base. A similar prior simulated baseball game utilizes dice instead of spinners to designate the various play possibilities during the game. The main drawback of those types of simulated baseball games lies in the failure of the games to represent or truly simulate the actual playing conditions of the game of baseball. That is, the spinning of spinners and the throwing of dice bear no relation skillwise to the pitching or batting of a ball. Furthermore, those prior games do not reproduce all of the playing situations and possibilities commonly found in a typical baseball game. There are some prior simulated baseball games in which a miniature ball is actually pitched to the batter. In other words, the player in the field operates a pitching mechanism which projects a small ball toward home plate. The player at bat manipulates a batting device at home plate and tries to hit the pitched ball. The game board has various holes or pockets over its playing area into which a hit ball can drop to represent various out and hit possibilities. Balls and strikes are determined by the pitched ball missing a designated strike zone and by the batter missing the pitched ball. That type of game has definite advantages over the games using spinners and dice because the outcome of the game is determined somewhat by the skills of the two players, rather than simply by the laws of chance. Even so, however, they do not even approach the realism of an actual baseball game because they do not offer all of the game options and possibilities that contribute to an exciting contest. Moreover, the various hit, out, double play, foul, etc. plays that are presented by these prior games do not reflect the actual statistical occurrence of those events or plays in a typical baseball game. Thus, while those prior games are denominated simulated base ball games, they do not, in practice, realistically reproduce a typical baseball game. Moreover, the prior games of that type of which we are aware are not particularly convenient to use by the players and it is often difficult for the players to keep track of the status of the game. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved simulated baseball game. Another object of the invention is to provide a simulated baseball game which requires the superior players to have more or less the same hand/eye coordination required in the actual game of baseball. A further object of the invention is to provide a simulated baseball game which is especially easy for the players to use. Still another object of the invention is to provide a baseball board game which realistically simulates an actual game of baseball. Other objects will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the following detailed description, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims. Briefly, the present game includes a relatively large, flat housing whose upper surface defines a baseball playing field, including the usual baseball diamond and outfields. Various electrical and mechanical components of the game to be described are positioned on the playing surface and within the housing. The game includes a mechanical pitching mechanism on the playing surface by which the player in the field pitches a small ball along the playing surface and across a home plate area of the baseball diamond inscribed on the playing surface. The player at bat tries to hit the pitched ball by manipulating a miniature bat pivotally mounted to the playing surface adjacent the home plate area. If the player at bat does not make contact with the pitched ball either because he fails to swing the bat or does swing the bat, but misses the ball, the pitched ball is trapped in one of a plurality of ball-receiving pockets located behind home plate which determines whether that pitch was a strike, a ball or a wild pitch. If, on the other hand, the player swinging the bat does make contact with the pitched ball, the ball is batted across the playing field and is trapped in one of a plurality of ball-receiving pockets located around the periphery of the outfield. These pockets have various designations corresponding to the various possibilities that exist in the usual game of baseball for a ball that is hit by the batter, including a foul ball, a single-, double- or triple-hit to the infield or outfield, a home run, as well as the usual out possibilities including double- and triple-play outs to the infield or outfield. Thus, the outfield pocket to which the ball is hit determines the fate of the player at bat. One of the features of the present game concerns the arrangement of these designated pockets so that they result in a game scenario which closely resembles the play during an actual baseball game. That is, the frequencies of occurrence of the balls, strikes, outs, fouls and hits to the various locations on the playing field of this game follow closely the frequencies of occurrence of those situations in a typical baseball game. Therefore, the present game captures much of the excitement of the real game. The present game includes signal lamps at the various bases and player locations on the playing field. Also the various pockets behind home plate and around the outfield contain switches connected in circuit with those signal lamps. Resultantly, when a ball is received in a particular pocket, the switch associated with that pocket is closed thereby illuminating a signal lamp corresponding to that pocket which apprises the players visually of the fate of each pitched ball. For example, if a pitched ball is not swung at by the batter, that ball will become trapped in either a &#34;ball&#34; pocket or a &#34;strike&#34; pocket or a &#34;wild pitch&#34; pocket behind home plate and an appropriate lamp is lit which signals that that ball was a ball, strike or a wild pitch. The game also includes provision for accumulating such balls and strikes so that the players know when a batter has struck out or deserves a walk to first base. Further, the game even detects when the batter has swung through at the ball, i.e., broken his wrist, so as to deserve a swinging strike. As a further example, when a ball is hit to a pocket designated &#34;hit to third base&#34;, a switch associated with that pocket is closed which turns on a white light at the third base location indicating that the batter has hit a single to third base. On the other hand, if the batted ball is trapped in a pocket designated &#34;out at third base&#34;, a different indication, namely a red light, is turned on at that location signaling the out and the &#34;man on base&#34; light at first base is not turned on. Similar hit and out lamps located at the various player positions on the infield and outfield signal hits or outs at those locations, depending upon which pockets the ball goes into when hit by the batter. The designated ball-receiving pockets include most, if not all, of the possibilities in an actual ball game including doubles, triples, home runs, foul balls, etc. After each hit is signaled, the player at bat turns on the &#34;man on base&#34; signal at the appropriate base, e.g., after a double is signaled, the &#34;on base&#34; light at second base is turned on; after a triple, the &#34;on base&#34; light at third base is turned on, and so on. Obviously also, if a man is already on base and the next batter gets a hit, the further advance of the man on base is signaled by the player at bat turning on the light at the base to which the man on base advances. The rules of the game call for the man on base to advance the same number of bases that a player typically would advance in an actual baseball game. Some of the outfield pockets are even labeled for a double play situation so that when the ball is received in one of those pockets, the most advanced runner on base and the batter are called out. Once the fate of each pitched ball has been signaled, the ball can be returned automatically to the pitching location in preparation for the next pitch. A preferred embodiment of my game can also be operated in a base-stealing mode whereby the player at bat actuates a switch which automatically changes the designations of some of the ball-receiving pockets so that they indicate that a player on base has stolen the next base or has been caught off base and is thus out. The stolen base feature is superimposed on the normal fielding options available and thus further increases the number of play possibilities available to the batter. Thus, it is a feature of the invention that the arrangement of the designated pockets and the options available to the players produce a simulated game in which the occurrences of playing possibilities and events closely follow those that occur in an actual baseball game so that the excitement generated by the board game approximates that produced by the real thing. Despite the fact that the present game has many, if not all, of the complexities of the actual game of baseball, the game is easy to operate and its rules are simple so that the game can be played by young children as well as adults. Consequently, it should find wide acceptance in the marketplace and prove to be a source of enjoyment to many. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a top plan view with parts cut away of a simulated baseball game embodying the principles of this invention; FIG. 2 is a similar view, but with the playing surface removed to expose internal components of the FIG. 1 game; FIG. 3 is a sectional view along line 3--3 of FIG. 1; and FIG. 4 is a sectional view along line 4--4 of FIG. 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3 of the drawings, the game includes a generally rectangular housing 12 having a pair of end walls 12a, a pair of side walls 12b and a bottom wall 12c. The housing side and end walls support a flat cover or top wall 14 which constitutes the game&#39;s playing surface. As best seen in FIG. 1, a conventional baseball playing field, including a printed diamond D, is laid out on surface 14. The diamond includes the usual bases (1B), (2B), (3B), and base lines (L), as well as a pitcher&#39;s mound (P) and a catcher location (C) behind home plate (HP). Also typical player positions at shortstop (SS), left field (LF), center field (CF) and right field (RF) are indicated on surface 14. A frame or border 16 mounted to the top of the housing side walls 12b and the outfield end wall 12a extends around the portion of the playing surface 14 beyond home plate. Still referring to FIG. 1, the game includes a pitching mechanism shown generally at 18 mounted to frame 16 at a location which is in a direct line with the home plate and second base positions on diamond D. Mechanism 18 includes a flat tray 22 which is connected to the top of frame 16 by a pivot 24 and is arranged to support a small steel or plastic ball B. A pair of walls 26 are mounted to the top of tray 22 which converge at the end of the tray facing diamond D. The opposite end of the tray supports a conventional spring-loaded plunger 28. By retracting the plunger handle 28a, the plunger can be moved from its solid line position to its dotted line position illustrated in FIG. 1. When handle 28 is released, the plunger springs forward and propels the ball B from the tray in the direction that the tray is pointing at the time. Thus, using handle 28a, the player in the field can retract the plunger and aim the tray so that, when the handle is released, the ball B will be propelled across surface 14 to the vicinity of home plate. Through practice, the player can pitch the ball directly across home plate or hit the inside or outside corners of the plate. He can even throw balls or intentionally walk a player if the occasion demands it. Indeed, he may even throw a wild pitch. And by retracting handle 28a different amounts and turning the handle, the player in the field can throw a fast ball, slow ball or curve. Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 3, the game&#39;s batting mechanism, indicated generally at 32, is located directly behind home plate and comprises an elongated bat 34 made of wood or comparable resilient material. A pivot pin 36 extends at right angles from the bat at a location spaced adjacent one end 34a of the bat. That pin is arranged to be rotatively received within one of two sockets 38 located to the left of and to the right of home plate so that, by manipulating the bat end 34a, the player at bat can swing the opposite end 34b of the bat through the home plate area and thus hit a ball B projected across home plate by the pitching mechanism 18. As best seen in FIG. 3, the actual contact with the ball is made by a relatively narrow peg or striker 42 depending from the bat end 34b. That striker 42 is the only part of the batting mechanism that makes physical contact with the pitched ball and it has a width which is less than the diameter of ball B thus making it relatively difficult for the player at bat to hit the pitched ball forcefully enough to propel it back across the diamond D to the outfield. FIG. 1 shows the bat 34 positioned in the left-hand socket 38 so that the bat is oriented for a left-handed hitter. When the player at bat is right-handed, the bat pivot pin 36 is positioned in the right-hand socket 38 so that the bat extends in the opposite direction across home plate. In either of these two positions, the player at bat can manipulate the bat handle 34a to swing at each ball pitched by the mechanism 18 operated by the player in the field. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, provision is made for signaling when the player at bat has swung through or &#34;broken his wrist&#34; at each pitched ball. In the game specifically illustrated herein, a small lamp 46 is located directly behind home plate. This lamp is connected electrically to a power source (not shown) such as a battery or transformer contained in housing 12 and to a pair of parallel-connected microswitches 48 positioned at opposite sides of home plate. A small finger 52 projects down from bat 34 adjacent its pivot pin 36 and the switches 48 are positioned so that, when the player at bat has swung through at the ball, the finger 52 engages and closes one of the two switches 48, depending upon whether the bat is positioned for a left- or right-handed hitter, thereby turning on lamp 46. If the player at bat partially swings at a pitch which is outside the strike area, the indication given by lamp 46 determines whether the batter should be awarded a strike or a ball. Referring to FIGS. 1, 2 and 4, when the player at bat fails to hit the pitched ball, the ball continues on to a catching area shown generally at C. The catching area comprises a plurality of pockets 58 which extend below the playing surface 14 and whose entrances or mouths are flush with that surface. The pockets 58 have a common front wall 62, a common rear wall 64 and separate spaced-apart side walls 66, each pocket being large enough to receive the ball B. As best seen in FIG. 4, the pockets 58 also have a common movable bottom wall in the form of a trapdoor 68 which is connected by a hinge 72 to rear wall 64. The trapdoor is normally maintained in its elevated, i.e., closed, position by a spring 74 connected between the free edge of the trapdoor and wall 62. The door is swung down to its open position by the player at bat lifting a lever 76 affixed to the left-hand end of the trapdoor which projects out from through an opening 77 in wall 64 and an opening 78 in housing end wall 12a behind the catching area C."

  "negative": "[0001] An associated application continues from previous research endeavors and expands on the development of certain therapeutic solutions. [0002] The innovative approach targets the creation of enhanced compound delivery systems, with a particular focus on medicinal applications. [0003] Researchers have long been challenged with the solubility issues of potent compounds like paclitaxel, which, despite its efficacy, presented limitations due to its poor water solubility. Historically, the resolution to administer such compounds intravenously has involved the use of a solvent that, while effective, carried significant drawbacks. [0004] The conventional solvent-based paclitaxel mix has seen broad application in the treatment of various cancers, with extensive research exploring its use in different contexts. However, the toxic nature of the solvent presents significant risks and limitations to patients. [0005] The complications associated with the conventional formulation have not been fully addressed in past research, leading to ongoing issues impacting the delivery and efficacy of the therapeutic agent. The entrapping effect of the solvent has been observed as dependent on its concentration, causing increased complications at higher doses without commensurate benefits. [0006] This entrapment of the therapeutic agent by the solvent markedly affects the availability of the agent within cells, which could have critical implications for patient outcomes. [0007] The present initiative has resulted in formulating compounds that significantly surpass previous methods in terms of effectiveness and reduction of adverse carrier effects.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In the quest for next generation therapies to treat cancer, scientist often discover promising compounds only to find that the molecule is highly insoluble in water, and hence impossible to deliver intravenously. Such was the problem with paclitaxel, an extremely effective anti-tumor agent discovered over a quarter century ago by the Nation Cancer Institute. Despite almost 30 years of effort, the only method currently approved to address this problem of water-insolubility of paclitaxel is the use of a toxic solvent (cremophor) to dissolve the drug, and administer this solvent-paclitaxel mixture over many hours using specialized intra-venous tubing sets to prevent the leaching of plasticizers. This solvent-drug mixture, currently marketed in branded and generic forms, has become the most widely used anti-cancer agent as it has shown activity in breast, lung and ovarian cancer and is undergoing multiple clinical trials exploring its application in combination with other drugs for other solid tumors. [0004] The cremophor formulation of paclitaxel is associated with significant side-effects including life-threatening allergic reactions requiring the need for steroid pre-treatment for every patient receiving the drug, and severe infections as a result of lowering of white blood cells requiring the need for expensive blood cell growth factors. Ultimately these toxicities result in dose-limitation of cremophor-based paclitaxel formulations, thus limiting the full potential of the very effective paclitaxel molecule. [0005] While the above toxic side effects of cremophor paclitaxel formulations are well known, it has not been widely recognized by scientists in the field that the presence of cremophor creates a more serious impediment to realizing the maximal potential of paclitaxel by entrapping paclitaxel within the hydrophobic cores of cremophor micelles within microdroplets in the blood-stream. The entrapment effect of cremophor is dependent on cremophor concentration. Thus, increasing the doses of cremophor solutions of paclitaxel can potentially worsen the entrapment by raising the concentration of cremophor, leading to higher toxcities but none of the potential benefits of higher doses of paclitaxel, since much of the active molecule is unavailable to the intra-cellular space, where it is needed to act. [0006] This entrapment of paclitaxel by cremophor has a profound effect on the intra-cellular availability of the active molecule and hence may have significant clinical implications in terms of clinical outcome. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for new formulations for the delivery of substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agents, such as paclitaxel, which do not suffer from the drawbacks of cremophor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0007] In accordance with the present invention, novel formulations have been developed which are much more effective for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs to patients in need thereof than are prior art formulations. Invention formulations are capable of delivering more drug in shorter periods of time, with reduced side effects caused by the pharmaceutical carrier employed for delivery. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES [0008] FIG. 1 collectively compares the plasma kinetics of radiolabelled paclitaxel when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). FIG. 1A indicates plasma radioactivity measured up to 0.5 hours after administration. FIG. 1B indicates plasma radioactivity measured up to 24 hours after administration. Inspection of the figure reveals that 2-5 fold higher levels of paclitaxel are retained in the plasma up to 3 hours after administration when paclitaxel is administered in a cremophor-based formulation (Taxol). Due to the reduced rate of metabolism for ABI-007, plasma levels of paclitaxel are higher after 8 hours when administered in an invention formulation, relative to a cremophor-based formulation. [0009] FIG. 2 compares the partitioning of paclitaxel between red blood cells and plasma when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). Inspection of the figure reveals that the blood/plasma ratio for paclitaxel administered as part of a cremophor-based formulation (Taxol) in the first 3 hours after administration is about 1.5-2, indicating that the majority of paclitaxel is retained in the plasma due to micellar formation with cremophor. In addition, it is seen that paclitaxel in a cremophor-based formulation does not significantly partition into the red blood cells. In contrast, paclitaxel administered as part of an invention formulation readily partitions into the red blood cells. [0010] FIG. 3 summarizes tumor/plasma partitioning kinetics of paclitaxel when administered to a mouse model as part of a Taxol formulation (closed squares) or as part of in invention formulation (diamonds; ABI-007). It is seen that the tumor/plasma ratio of paclitaxel increases significantly over the first 3 hours when as part of an invention formulation, as opposed to a Taxol formulation. [0011] FIG. 4 compares the response of mammary carcinoma in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0012] FIG. 5 compares the response of ovarian carcinoma in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0013] FIG. 6 compares the response of prostate tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0014] FIG. 7 compares the response of colon tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. [0015] FIG. 8 compares the response of lung tumors in a mouse model to exposure to ABI-007 or Taxol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0016] In accordance with the present invention, there are provided methods for the delivery of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, and administering an effective amount of said combination to said subject. [0017] As readily recognized by those of skill in the art, a wide variety of pharmacologically active agents are contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention. A presently preferred agent contemplated for use herein is paclitaxel. [0018] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention are biocompatible materials such as albumin. [0019] Micelle-forming components which are preferably avoided in the practice of the present invention are surface active materials which are commonly used to assist in solubilizing substantially insoluble compounds in aqueous media, such as, for example, cremophor. [0020] Invention combination of active agent and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be administered in a variety of ways, such as, for example, by oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intramuscular, intracranial, inhalational, topical, transdermal, rectal, or pessary routes of administration, and the like. [0021] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to reduce entrapment of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent in vehicle employed for delivery thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0022] Presently preferred pharmaceutically acceptable carriers contemplated for use herein are those having substantially lower affinity for said agent than does the micelle-forming component. Thus, for example, while cremophor has the benefit of aiding in the solubilization of agent, it has the disadvantage of having a substantial affinity for the agent, so that release of the agent from the carrier becomes a limitation on the bioavailability of the agent. In contrast, carriers contemplated herein, such as, for example, albumin, readily release the active agent to the active site and are thus much more effective for treatment of a variety of conditions. [0023] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to reduce entrapment of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent in vehicle employed for delivery thereof, said method comprising employing pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which are substantially free of micelle-forming components in aqueous media as the vehicle for delivery of said agent. [0024] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to prolong exposure of a subject to a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0025] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to facilitate transport of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent across cell membranes upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0026] In accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods to facilitate transport of a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent into the cellular compartment upon administration thereof to a subject in need thereof, said method comprising combining said agent with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) which is(are) substantially free of micelle-forming components prior to delivery thereof. [0027] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher concentration of said agent in the cellular compartment than a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0028] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides increased intra-cellular availability of said agent relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0029] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides prolonged activity of said agent relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0030] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation facilitates delivery of said agent to red blood cells. [0031] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation releases a portion of said agent contained therein to the lipid membrane of a cell. [0032] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides reduced levels of said agent in the bloodstream relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0033] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation delivers said agent to the bloodstream over an extended period of time relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0034] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein the rate of metabolism of said agent in said formulation is reduced relative to the rate of metabolism of said agent in a formulation with a micelle-forming component. [0035] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said agent has a longer half life in said formulation relative to the half life of said agent in a formulation with a micelle-forming component. [0036] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher red blood cell/plasma ratio of said agent than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0037] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher tumor/plasma ratio of said agent than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0038] In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein the area under the curve for delivery of said agent to a tumor via said formulation is higher than the area under the curve for delivery of said agent to a tumor via a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0039] In accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a higher concentration maximum (C max ) for said agent in tumor cells than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0040] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides a lower concentration maximum (C max ) for said agent in plasma than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0041] In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation provides more rapid uptake of said agent by tumor cells than does a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0042] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising a substantially water insoluble pharmacologically active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is substantially free of micelle-forming components, wherein said formulation enhances delivery of said agent to tissue, relative to a formulation of the same agent with a micelle-forming component. [0043] Tissues contemplated for treatment according to the invention include tumors, peritoneal tissue, bladder tissue, lung tissue, and the like. ABI-007 is a proprietary, cremophor-free, albumin-based paclitaxel nanoparticle, 1/100 th the size of a single red blood cell. Based on several Phase I studies, it has been shown that ABI-007 can be administered rapidly without the need for steroid pre-treatment and without the need for G-CSF at a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/m 2 given every 3 weeks. This is a significantly higher dose than is approved for cremophor-based paclitaxel formulations (Taxol) of 175 Mg/m 2. [0044] In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that ABI-007 acts as a novel biologic nano-transporter for hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel, with the capabilities of rapidly releasing paclitaxel to the cellular compartment and increasing intra-cellular availability of the active drug, where it is needed in order to have its chemo-therapeutic effect. Furthermore, through the use of the red blood cell as a secondary storage vehicle it has been discovered that in addition to the rapid and increased availability of paclitaxel at the intra-cellullar level, by the recruitment of circulating red blood cells, ABI-007 further provides a significant prolonged activity of the parent molecule with sustained in-vivo release. These novel mechanisms for rapid and increased intra-cellular availability of the drug at the tumor site, together with sustained trafficking of the non-metabolized paclitaxel, has potentially significant implications for the clinical outcome in the treatment of solid tumors. Indeed, the pre-clinical and Phase II clinical data presented below supports this notion. [0045] By taking advantage of the differences in binding affinities of albumin and the lipid bi-layer of cell membranes for hydrophobic paclitaxel, the drug-bearing albumin nanoparticle (ABI-007) would rapidly release a portion of its hydrophobic paclitaxel cargo to the lipid membrane of a cell. [0046] In the vascular compartment, the first cell encountered is the red blood cell. In accordance with the present invention, the red blood cell has been found to rapidly compartmentalize the paclitaxel molecule. Since the red blood cell has no nucleus and hence no microtubulin to which the paclitaxel molecule can bind, nor any degradation machinery within its core, this cell serves as an ideal secondary storage vehicle for the active paclitaxel, accounting in part for the prolonged activity of paclitaxel noted with ABI-007."

  "query": "What are the cosmetic and dermatological applications of a product derived from gastropod spawn, especially targeting skin stem cells?,",
  "negative": "The study pertains to a novel extraction method involving arthropod exuviae for use in topical dermatological solutions that aim to foster rejuvenation and restoration of aged dermal layers. This unique extraction process utilizes the exoskeletons of certain arthropods, which are abundant in chitin, minerals, and specific growth factors that contribute to skin renewal. The exuviae are collected during the shedding period and processed under controlled conditions to ensure the purity and effectiveness of the extract. Although arthropod exuviae have been known for their skin repairing properties, this new methodology enhances the bioavailability of the essential components, making the extract an ideal ingredient for anti-aging creams, serums and other skincare products. It is particularly noted for its role in supporting the underlying cellular matrix, thus leading to improved skin elasticity and a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. However, unlike snail spawn derivatives, this extract has not shown direct action on skin stem cells nor demonstrated a mobilization effect on these cells.\n\n",
  "pos": "[0001] The present invention relates to a product obtained from gastropod spawn, to be used in the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions capable of activating and mobilising skin stem cells, as well as preventing the loss thereof that takes place as a consequence of chronological and/or premature ageing of the skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The skin is the largest organ in the human, or animal, body. It acts as a protective barrier that isolates the body from the surrounding medium, protecting it and contributing to preserve its structures intact, whilst acting as a communication system with the environment. The skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the most superficial layer, the dermis, which is the intermediate layer, and the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, which is the deepest layer of the skin. [0003] Since it is the outermost organ, the skin is subjected to significant deterioration and aggression, which leads to premature ageing of the skin. The external factors that act thereon include excess solar radiation, atmospheric contamination, abusive use of surfactants, tobacco smoke, etc. But the skin may also suffer from premature ageing as a result of internal or endogenous factors, such as those related to an unbalanced nutrition in terms of vitamins, iatrogenic factors such as radiotherapy, the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, etc., or the presence in the body of very reactive toxins such as those ingested by drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. Natural ageing also occurs as a consequence, for example, of the production of free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA alterations, etc. [0004] Deterioration of the skin appears in the form of wrinkles, spots, laxity, benign neoplasms, etc. [0005] Numerous cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions have been disclosed for treatment of the skin, and the care and cleaning thereof, composed of very different ingredients, which include plant extracts and animal extracts. In this regard, one of the ingredients used in the preparation of skin care cosmetics have been gastropod secretions, what is commonly referred to as snail slime. Thus, for example, document DE1813154 discloses a composition designed for skin care that contains a fat and one or more active agents, which contains the slippery lubricating secretion excreted by a snail, particularly Helix pomatia. Patent FR2595247 discloses that extracts from the mucous membranes or digestive juices of gastropods are useful in cosmetics at concentrations ranging between 0.1%-10% due to their moisturising action on the epidermal surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,740 discloses an active ingredient for cosmetic or therapeutic compositions obtained from the secretion of a centrifuged live gastropod, and said compositions may be applied to skin care. [0006] On the other hand, document CA2611645 discloses the use of a Helix aspersa \u201csnail slime\u201d product to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells in vitro. [0007] A stem cell is a cell that has the capacity to renew itself by means of mitotic divisions or to continue the differentiation pathway for which it is programmed. Moreover, it is capable of producing cells of one or more mature, functional, fully differentiated tissues, as a function of its degree of multipotentiality. Most of the tissues of an adult individual have their own specific population of stem cells which allow for their periodical renewal or their regeneration when tissue damage occurs. In particular, the epidermis undergoes constant renewal and consists of a stratified squamous epithelium associated with pilose follicles and sebaceous glands. These specialised structures are maintained by the self-renewal of epidermal stem cells and the differentiation of the offspring thereof. Skin stem cells are crucial for the healing of wounds and the regeneration of the skin and the hair. However, the capacity of stem cells may be diminished due to genetic problems, environmental influences and the ageing process. Therefore, the protection of stem cells is extremely important. [0008] Although snail secretions are known to be useful for the preparation of skin cosmetics, thus far no product derived from snail spawn has been disclosed for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions that has a proven action on skin stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof and, consequently, preventing and correcting ageing of the skin. [0009] In this regard, the present invention discloses a product obtained from gastropod spawn for the preparation of cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions which has been shown to have very beneficial effects on the skin, preventing and correcting the ageing thereof by acting directly on epithelial stem cells. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0010] The object of the present invention consists of a product prepared from gastropod spawn of the family Helicidae, which is used for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions for the skin. Said product has the capacity to act on stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof as a consequence of ageing of the skin caused by both endogenous and exogenous stressful factors. [0011] The product is composed of organic and inorganic molecules from snail spawn, the organic molecules being polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, peptides and amino acids, where the proteins and glycoproteins present a characteristic electrophoretic pattern, similar to that shown in FIG. 1 , and the inorganic molecules being cations and anions such as phosphate, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium, in their most stable ion forms. [0012] The product derived from snail spawn is used in the preparation of dermo-cosmetic compositions in the form of serum, solutions, injectables (monodose), gel (Hydragel), o/w gel-cream, w/o gel-cream, o/w cream, w/o cream, w/s cream, o/w/o cream, extemporaneous facial mask preparations, patches and, in general, all dermo-cosmetic (cosmeceutical) forms that may be used in the formulation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical products. Said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, facilitates the rescue of skin stem cells intended to disappear due to senescence or endogenous or exogenous aggressions, and promotes the activation of said cells, as shown in Example 2 of the present specification. This activation is characterised by premature induction of DNA replication during cell division. [0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18\u00b0 C.-24\u00b0 C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21\u00b0 C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0023] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration of 70% (w/w), in purified water; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a Silverson mill; they are filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of a cream, using it at a 70% concentration. Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or \u201cbulge\u201d (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (\u201cbulge\u201d) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4\u00b0 C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4\u00b0 C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5\u00d70.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group."

Alternatively, reduction with iron powder/NH 4 Cl or the like may be applied. The esterification may be conducted by heating along with the starting alcohol in the presence of hydrochloric, sulfuric or p-toluenesulfonic acid, if necessary, followed by azeotropic dehydration in the co-existence of an azeotropic dehydrating agent such as benzene, thereby readily providing the desired ester.

  "query": "How does the implantable medical lead create high impedance in the presence of a strong magnetic field?,",
  "negative": "The disclosed embodiments include a medical device designed to regulate electrical signal propagation through its internal circuitry when exposed to an external magnetic field. The device is implanted into the patient and implements multiple mechanical components within its structure that react to the magnetic field by altering the electrical connectivity of the signal path. This adaptation is achieved without the intervention of any external monitoring or control systems, and operates purely based on the internal configuration of the mechanical components which are designed to sense the magnetic field strength and respond accordingly to maintain the optimal functioning of the device within a predetermined magnetic field threshold. The details of the configuration of these components, the materials used, and the mechanism by which they alter the circuit's impedance in the presence of a magnetic field, although similar in purpose, are differently realized to avoid specific orientations and direct interactions with the magnetic fields typically encountered in clinical diagnostic equipment, such as MRI machines.\n\n",
  "pos": "TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] Embodiments relate to implantable medical leads and systems. More particularly, embodiments relate to the creation of a high impedance within a conduction path of an implantable medical lead when in the presence of a magnetic field of a given strength that is significantly greater than is present in typical ambient conditions, such as magnetic fields that may be encountered within a bore of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. BACKGROUND [0002] An implantable medical lead of an implantable medical system carries electrical stimulation signals from a pulse generator located at an implantation site of a patient to one or more electrodes at a distal end of the implantable medical lead that are located at a stimulation site of the patient. Electrical conductors within an insulative body of the implantable medical lead provide a conduction path for the electrical stimulation signals to traverse. [0003] Patients having implantable medical systems that include implantable medical leads may have the need to undergo MRI scans. During the MRI scan, the patient is exposed to a relatively large static magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla or more as well as a smaller gradient magnetic field. While the magnetic fields may have a specific and known orientation relative to the scanning bore of the MRI machine and therefore to the body of the patient, it is noteworthy that the implantable medical lead and particularly the distal end within the patient may have any number of orientations relative to the magnetic fields. [0004] Within the MRI, the patient is also exposed to a relatively high power radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic energy in the megahertz frequency range. This RF electromagnetic energy presents a potentially dangerous situation for the patient during the MRI scan. The RF electromagnetic energy may couple to the conductors within the implantable medical lead that provide the conduction path to the electrodes and thereby create relatively high levels of RF electrical current that produces heating of the tissue surrounding the electrodes. This is especially problematic for implantable neurostimulation systems where the electrodes are positioned in highly vulnerable stimulation sites such as within the brain or adjacent to the spinal cord. SUMMARY [0005] Embodiments address issues such as these and others by providing multiple actuators within the lead that are responsive to a magnetic field where each actuator is capable of opening a switch within the conduction path over a particular range of magnetic field orientation. Thus regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field to the lead and the actuators within the lead, the magnetic field causes at least one actuator to open the switch and thereby disconnect the electrode from the remainder of the conduction path on the opposite side of the switch. The open switch creates a low capacitance, high impedance path for any RF energy coupled to the lead conduction path. Including the switch in close proximity to the electrode leaves only an insignificant short conductive path length that remains connected to the electrode. The amount of heating that may be generated at the electrode is thereby reduced to a safer level. [0006] Embodiments provide a method of creating a high impedance within a conduction path of an implantable medical lead. The method involves providing a first actuator that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The method further involves providing a second actuator that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. The method also involves providing at least one switch in series with the conduction path that resides in a closed state and achieves an open state to create the high impedance when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position. [0007] Embodiments provide an implantable medical lead that includes a lead body, a conductor surrounded by the lead body, and an electrode coupled to the distal end of the lead body. The lead further includes a first actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The lead also includes a second actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. Additionally, the lead includes at least one switch within the lead body and in series between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body, the at least one switch residing in a closed state and achieving an open state to create a high impedance between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position. [0008] Embodiments provide a medical system that includes a pulse generator and an implantable medical lead. The lead includes a lead body, a conductor surrounded by the lead body, the conductor being electrically coupled to the pulse generator, and an electrode coupled to the distal end of the lead body. The lead further includes a first actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a first start position to a first stop position and reaches the first stop position when a force acting on the first actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the first actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented normal to a direction of movement of the first actuator. The lead also includes a second actuator within the lead body that when in the presence of a magnetic field attempts to move from a second start position to a second stop position and reaches the second stop position when a force acting on the second actuator due to the presence of the magnetic field is adequate to produce such movement, the second actuator being responsive to magnetic fields that are not oriented parallel to a direction of movement of the second actuator. Additionally, the lead includes at least one switch within the lead body and in series between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body, the at least one switch residing in a closed state and achieving an open state to create a high impedance between the conductor and the electrode on the distal end of the lead body when the first actuator reaches the first stop position and/or when the second actuator reaches the second stop position.

[0021] FIG. 13 shows another example of a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch configuration within an implantable medical lead. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0022] Embodiments provide implantable medical systems that have implantable leads containing a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch within the conduction path to an electrode of the lead. In these various embodiments, the switch is magnetic orientation-independent by operating independently of orientation of the magnetic field to a direction of movement of one or more actuators of the switch, although the switch may be more sensitive to certain orientations of the magnetic field than others. According to these embodiments, when the implantable lead is brought into the presence of a significant magnetic field, such as within an MRI machine, the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch is forced into an open state to thereby electrically disconnect the electrode from the remainder of the conduction path and create a high impedance for RF currents. Heating of tissue at the electrode is reduced to a safe level as a result of the conduction path being disconnected from the electrode by the switch. [0023] FIG. 1 shows a typical operating environment for embodiments of the medical lead having the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch. An implantable medical system 100 is implanted within a patient 112 and includes an implantable pulse generator 102 and an implantable medical lead 104 that is coupled to the implantable pulse generator 102. The lead 104 includes a distal end 106 where one or more electrodes 108 , 110 are present. Electrical stimulation signals from the pulse generator 102 are carried by the lead 104 to the electrodes 108 , 110 where the stimulation is delivered to the tissue at the stimulation site within the patient 112. [0024] The distal end 106 of this example is shown in more detail in FIG. 2. Here, it can be seen that the lead 104 has an insulative lead body 202 that contains electrical conductors 204 and 206. The electrical conductors 204 , 206 may be cables or coils. The electrical conductor 204 is electrically connected on a first end to a proximal contact or other electrical connection established with the pulse generator 102. The conductor 204 is electrically connected on the end shown in FIG. 2 to a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 208 which is in turn electrically connected to the electrode 110. The electrical conductor 206 is connected to a magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 210 which is in turn connected to the electrode 108. These switches 208 , 210 are also contained within the lead body 202. It will be appreciated that either of the electrodes 108 , 110 may be a most distal electrode or may be located proximal of other distal electrodes that may or may not have switches in the corresponding conduction path. [0025] The positioning of the distal end 106 of the lead 104 may vary from one patient to another. While one patient may have the distal end 106 positioned as shown in FIG. 1 , another patient may have the distal end positioned at a different angle relative to a reference axis of the patient 112. So even though the direction of the magnetic field within an MRI machine may be a known constant, the orientation of the magnetic field of the MRI machine to the distal end 106 of the lead varying from one patient to the next results in the orientation of the switches 208 , 210 relative to the magnetic field of the MRI machine also varying from one patient to the next. Therefore, the switches 208 , 210 are constructed so as to be magnetic orientation-independent. Examples of such a magnetic orientation-independent construction are discussed below. [0026] FIGS. 3 and 4 show one example of the magnetic orientation-independent magnetically actuated switch 208 in more detail. In this example, the switch 208 is shaped as a cylinder to facilitate inclusion within the lead body 104. On one end, a ferromagnetic body 302 is positioned beside another ferromagnetic body 304 with a gap 306 present between to allow the ferromagnetic body 302 to move toward the ferromagnetic body 304. The switch 208 further includes series of non-ferromagnetic bodies 308 separated by ferromagnetic bodies 310. On the end opposite the body 302 is an actuator end 318. The internal details of the switch 208 and the operation of the actuator end 318 are discussed in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 5-8. [0027] This example of the switch 208 also includes a conductor 312 that includes an orthogonal spring loaded portion 314 that spans the actuator end 318. As discussed below, one or more actuators extend from the actuator end 318 during operation of the switch 208 in the presence of a significant magnetic field. However, these one or more actuators should not extend from the actuator end 318 when not in the presence of the magnetic field. The spring loaded portion 314 applies a bias to the actuator end 318 to return the actuators to a start position once removed from the magnetic field and to maintain those actuators in the start position to allow the connectivity to the electrode 110 to be maintained. The bias of the spring loaded portion 314 is chosen to be great enough to overcome any frictional resistance plus resistance from any residual magnetic forces to returning the actuators to the start position while being low enough to be overcome by the force the expected magnetic field of the MRI machine or other concern produces in the actuators. [0028] The conductor 312 and spring loaded portion 314 may also serve as a conductive portion of the switch 208. The conductor 204 of the lead 104 may be electrically connected to the conductor 312. A conductor 205 that extends to the electrode 110 is also connected to an electrical contact 316 mounted on the actuator end 318 of the switch 208. The electrical contact 316 may be electrically isolated from any conductive surfaces of the switch other than the spring loaded portion 314 for instance by being mounted on a non-conductive surface. When the spring loaded portion 314 is holding the actuators in the start position as in FIG. 3 , the spring loaded portion 314 contacts the electrical contact 316 so that a conductive path is completed from the conductor 204 to the conductor 205 so that stimulation signals may proceed to the electrode 110. However, in the presence of a significant magnetic field that produced forces in the actuators of the switch 208 \u2032 to overcome the bias of the spring loaded portion 314 \u2032 as shown in FIG. 4 , the spring loaded portion 314 is disconnected from the electrical contact 316 at the actuator end 318 \u2032 to thereby disconnect the conductor 205 and electrode 110 from the remainder of the conductor 204. This disconnection substantially reduces the heating that occurs at the electrode 110 due to ambient RF electromagnetic energy. [0029] FIG. 5 shows a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the switch 208 which shows actuators 317 , 319 in the starting position where no significant magnetic field is present and where the ends of the actuators 317 , 319 do not extend beyond the actuator end 318 as shown in FIG. 3. The actuator 317 is a pin that is mechanically coupled to the ferromagnetic body 302. The actuator 319 is a cylinder constructed of a series of ferromagnetic bodies separated by non-ferromagnetic bodies, where the ferromagnetic bodies of the actuator 319 are offset from the outer ferromagnetic bodies included in the outer cylinder surrounding the actuator 319. For instance, ferromagnetic body 313 is offset from ferromagnetic body 310 while ferromagnetic body 315 is offset from ferromagnetic body 310 and ferromagnetic body 311 , albeit with ferromagnetic body 315 being closer to ferromagnetic body 311 than to ferromagnetic body 310. Ferromagnetic bodies 310 and 311 are separated by the non-ferromagnetic body 309. In this example, the actuator 317 is positioned coaxially with the actuator 319 by being located within a bore through the actuator 319."

[0002] Earlier apparatuses employing a helical rod substitute it with a rod composed of a material known for superior resilience to provide adequate suppleness.

  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/075,611 filed Mar. 30, 2011, which claims priority from European Patent Application No. 10158573.5 filed Mar. 31, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a reaming device, and in particular to a reaming device providing a reliable connection between a carbon fiber composite shaft and an interface element molded thereon. [0003] Intramedullary nailing is the method of choice for the fixation of fractures in long bones, in particular bones in long extremities. To have full access to the intramedullary channel, a shaft of a reamer has to be flexible enough in a bending direction to bypass soft tissue and conform to bone curvature. The shaft also has to be rigid enough to convey torsion to the reamer head. Prior art reaming devices have a shaft design consisting of a helix in which residues can be trapped during the reaming procedure, so that the cleaning of the reaming device in hospitals prior to the next usage is complicated, in particular in a sterilization process. The adequate cleaning of the instrument in hospitals demands a great effort and takes a lot of time. Further, some hospitals are not prepared to clean such critical devices because of the great effort involved. [0004] In some prior art reaming devices, a helix shaft is replaced by a shaft made of so called nitinol, which is a material having a high degree of elasticity (super elasticity) to provide enough flexibility. Nitinol is an acronym for NIckel TItanium Naval Ordnance Laboratory. Nitinol is the inter-metallic phase NiTi having a regular cubic crystal structure being different of the structure of titanium or nickel. Nitinol comprises about 55% nickel and about 45% titanium. Owing to the fact that the nitinol shaft is made of a single tube, the cleaning effort in the hospital is less exhausting. However, recent investigations have shown that the nitinol material has a catastrophic failure mode. In particular, some reports have pointed out that some breakages in multiple fragments of the nitinol shaft occurred during the reaming process during the intervention process in hospitals. Further, the nitinol material is a very expensive material. [0005] EP 253526 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,922 relates to a shaft made of a composite material of filamentous fibers and an appropriate resin.

The disclosure of 2010/0239380 is incorporated herein by reference. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] It is one aspect of the present invention to provide a more reliable reaming device. [0010] One aspect of the present invention is solved by a reaming device comprising a shaft with a mounting portion, the mounting portion having an outer surface. A carbon fiber layer located on the mounting portion outer surface. An injection molded interface element for mechanical coupling of an external device molded on the carbon fiber layer, the interface element having a mounting portion. The carbon fiber layer extends over the outer surface of the shaft mounting portion and has an outer surface. The carbon fiber layer outer surface has a non-smooth surface structure. The injection molded interface element mounting portion is injection molded over the carbon fiber layer surface structure. The shaft of the reaming device is made of a carbon fiber reinforced material. The carbon fiber layer comprises a wrapped carbon fiber with a resin impregnation. The carbon fiber layer surface structure comprises a pressed tooth structure. The pressed tooth structure comprises an elongated rippled structure. The interface element comprises a coupling portion for coupling a power tool reamer drive as an external device. The coupling portion comprises an end portion being capable of transmitting a torque. The injection molded interface element comprises a rated break section between its mounting portion and its coupling portion. The injection molded interface element comprises a mold material having shape stability at common sterilization temperatures, wherein the injection molded interface element comprises a deformation indicating pattern indicating a pre-breaking deformation. Both, the shaft and the interface element each have an elongated through bore, the both through bores aligning to each other. [0011] A method for manufacturing a reaming device, comprises wrapping a carbon fiber layer over an outer surface of a mounting portion of a shaft. A surface structure is pressed on an outer surface of the carbon fiber layer. An interface element is injection molded over the surface structure. The wrapping comprises impregnating the carbon fiber layer with an impregnation agent being compatible with a material of the shaft. The shaft mounting portion is prepared before wrapping a carbon fiber layer for establishing a reliable connection between the shaft and the carbon fiber layer. The pressing includes heat setting of the carbon fiber layer in a closed mold. According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a reaming device has a shaft with a mounting portion. The mounting portion has an outer surface, a carbon fiber layer and an injected-molded interface element for mechanically coupling an external device. The injected-molded interface element has a mounting portion. The carbon fiber layer extends over the outer surface of the shaft mounting portion and has its own surface. The carbon fiber layer outer surface has a surface structure. The injection-molded interface element mounting portion is injection-molded over the carbon fiber layer outer surface structure. Thus, the shaft can be provided with an outer surface structure, so that an injection-molded interface element can be easily integrally formed on the shaft, i.e. the carbon fiber layer extending over the shaft. Thus, the shaft can be designed to fulfill the particular requirements for a shaft, for example flexibility and a particular strength against breakage and wherein the integrally formed injection-molded interface element may be designed to fulfill the particular requirements for coupling an external device. Such requirements may include for example a particular geometry and particular material properties which may be met by the injection-molded interface element. [0012] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the shaft is made of a carbon fiber reinforced material. Thus, a particular strength for preventing a breakage of a shaft can be provided, in particular as a carbon fiber reinforced material has a particular flexibility and elasticity while maintaining the capability of transmitting torque forces, and at the same time owing to the carbon fiber reinforced structure does not tend to break into multiple fragments. [0013] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the carbon fiber layer comprises a wrapped carbon fiber with a resin impregnation. Thus, it is possible to bring the carbon fiber layer into a particular shape which is required for molding over the interface element. In particular, the resin impregnation may be a thermosetting resin, so that a particular cast can be heated to set the resin impregnation of the carbon fiber layer. [0014] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the carbon fiber layer surface structure comprises a pressed tooth structure. Thus, a reliable connection between the shaft and the carbon fiber layer, respectively, on the one hand and the molded interface element on the other hand may be established. In particular, a tooth structure allows for a mechanically reliable force transmission between the shaft and the interface element. [0015] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the interface element comprises a coupling portion for coupling a power tool reamer drive as an external device. Thus, a drive or any other power tool may be coupled to the coupling portion of the interface element in order to drive the shaft. [0016] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the coupling portion comprises an end portion being capable of transmitting a torque. Thus, a torque of a power tool can be transmitted to the shaft via the interface element. In particular, the end portion may be designed as a hexagonal cross-section. However, it should be noted that also any other angular geometry may be used. It should be noted that also a free-shape cross-section may be used, e.g. having a waved outer contour. In particular, a unique cross-sectional shape may be used in order to guarantee the correct use of a particular tool together with the corresponding reaming device. In other words, the coupling of an intended combination of a reaming device and a corresponding power tool may be established by a unique corresponding coupling geometry between the power tool and the respective coupling portion or end portion of the interface element. [0017] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the injection-molded interface element comprises a rated break arrangement or geometry (having a predetermined sheer strength) between its mounting portion and its coupling portion. Thus, a predetermined breaking point or a weak section can be established so that the reaming device will break at this particular section when exceeding a predetermined torque. In particular, this may avoid an unintended break at a location which is not accessible, for example close to the reaming head. In other words, the predetermined breaking point or rated break point will be established in a safe and accessible region of the reaming device so that no broken parts of the reaming device remain in the patient&#39;s body. [0018] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the injection-molded interface element comprises a mold material having shape stability at common sterilization temperatures. Thus, it can be guaranteed that the reaming device cannot be sterilized without losing its particular geometry properties. This is of relevance if providing the reaming device as a single use device. In case, if the surgeon tries to use the reaming device again, he has to sterilize the reaming device, but during this sterilization, the reaming device will be predeterminently destroyed to avoid any reuse of the reaming device. It should be noted that either the entire interface element may be made of the non-heat resistant material, or only particular sections thereof may be made of the non-heat resistant material, if using for example a two stepped molding process using two different molding materials. It should also be noted that a heat resistant portion may be provided to maintain an \u201cemergency\u201d geometry, which however is not comfortable geometry for surgery. In particular one component of a multiple step mold may be heat resistant and the other component of a multiple step mold may be not heat resistant. The lost form stability may also be established by the impact of another parameter of sterilization, e.g. steam or the like. Thus, the interface element may be designed to lose its form stability when being treated by steam. [0019] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the injection-molded interface element comprises a deformation indicating pattern indicating a pre-breaking deformation. Thus, the surgeon can directly recognize a critical deformation of the interface element when recognizing the indicating pattern. This indicating pattern may be for example a longitudinal line or a longitudinal groove extending into the longitudinal direction of the interface element. In case the longitudinal groove or line deforms for example like a helix, the surgeon knows that a torque is applied, or that a particular threshold may be extended. It should be noted, that also an interfering grid may be used as a deformation indicating pattern, so that for example a particular Newton pattern may occur at particular stages of deformation, so that a particular Newton pattern may be used as an indicative for the grade of deformation. [0020] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, both, the shaft and the interface element each have an elongated through bore, wherein the both through bores align to each other. Thus, a guide wire or a securing wire can be inserted into the aligning through bores. A guide wire may be used for an improved targeting of the reaming device, wherein a securing wire may be used for a reaming head being provided at the reaming device. [0021] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for manufacturing a reaming device, comprising: wrapping a carbon fiber layer over an outer surface of a mounting portion of a shaft. A surface structure is pressed onto an outer surface of the carbon fiber layer. An interface layer is injection-molded over the surface structure. Thus, in particular when using a shaft made of a carbon fiber reinforced material, a carbon fiber layer may provide a reliable and compatible connection between the carbon fiber layer and the shaft. The outer surface structure of the carbon fiber layer establishes a reliable mechanical connection between the carbon fiber layer and the injection-molded interface element. In particular, such a method allows manufacturing a reaming device without having undue material tensions during a manufacturing process, as an injection-molding more or less provides a material morphology having a low or no material tensions. [0022] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, wrapping comprises impregnating the carbon fiber layer with an impregnation agent being compatible with a material of the shaft. Thus, a reliable connection between the shaft and the carbon fiber layer may be established. [0023] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises preparing a shaft mounting portion before wrapping a carbon fiber layer for establishing a reliable connection between the shaft and the carbon fiber layer. Thus, a kind of priming can be carried out before mounting the wrapped carbon fiber layer onto the shaft in order to establish a reliable connection being capable of transmitting torque. [0024] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, pressing includes heat-setting of the carbon fiber layer in a closed mold. Thus, a fast and reliable manufacturing process can be established. In particular, when using a mold of a thermoplastic material and a thermosetting impregnation for the carbon fiber layer, a defined weak section can be established allowing a reliable transmission of forces and at the same time a predefined weak section as described above. [0025] It should be noted that the above features may also be combined. The combination of the above features may also lead to a synergetic effect, even if not explicitly described herein in detail. [0026] These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0027] FIG. 1 illustrates a shaft for a reamer with a carbon fiber layer before wrapping; [0028] FIG. 2 illustrates a shaft with a wrapped carbon fiber wrapping having a surface structure; [0029] FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shaft with an overmolded interface element; [0030] FIG. 4 illustrates an outer view of a shaft with an overmolded interface element; and [0031] FIG. 5 illustrates a schematic flow chart of a method for manufacturing a reaming device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0032] FIG. 1 illustrates a shaft 10 , in particular a reamer shaft having a mounting portion 11. The shaft 10 has an outer surface, onto which a carbon fiber layer 30 is wrapped. FIG. 1 illustrates the carbon fiber layer 30 in an unwrapped condition. [0033] FIG. 2 illustrates the end portion of a shaft 10 , wherein the carbon fiber layer 30 is wrapped around the outer surface of the mounting portion 11. As can be seen from FIG. 2 , the carbon fiber layer comprises a surface structure 34 on the outer surface 33 of the carbon fiber layer. This outer structure may be formed for example as a tooth structure or a rippled or ripped structure, wherein ripples or rips run along a longitudinal direction of the shaft 10. It should be noted that the rips of the surface structure 34 may also run in a helical way in order to carry not only circumferential forces, e.g. torque forces, but also forces in a longitudinal direction of the shaft, like pushing or pulling forces. It should be noted that the surface structure 34 may also have any other structure being capable of transmitting forces from the shaft 10 to an interface element 20 or vice versa such as for example splines. [0034] FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the end section of a shaft 10 provided with an overmolded interface element 20. The interface element 20 has a mounting portion 21 , which engages with the surface structure of the carbon fiber layer outer surface 33 , 34. Thus, forces can be transmitted from the shaft 10 to the interface element 20. The interface element and the shaft 10 both may comprise a through bore 19 , 29 , respectively, which through bores may align. Thus, a guide wire or a securing wire can be inserted through the aligned through bores 19 , 29 so as to serve as a guide for the reaming tool and the reaming process, as well as securing for example a reaming head to be mounted on the other end section of the shaft (not shown). The injection-molded interface element 20 may comprise a rated break section 26 , which may be for example a groove or a notch. As the interface element 20 also comprises a coupling portion 25 , the rated break point section 26 can be provided between the mounting portion 21 on the one hand and the coupling portion 25 on the other hand."

  "negative": "The disclosure pertains to a technique for dynamic recalibration and real-time adjustment of analytics data for enhancing accuracy in the reading and interpretation of fluid-based signaling systems. These systems are primarily utilized in non-invasive procedures such as surface pressure gauging in various industrial applications. In such setups, physical measurements are captured through sensors and relayed through a fluidic medium to an external analyzer. Due to inherent variances in the properties of the medium, including viscosity, composition, and pathway geometry, the transmitted readings often exhibit discrepancies that necessitate rectification. Traditionally, recalibration using external benchmarks has been the norm, yet it is a cumbersome process marred by the need for periodic manual intervention. Embodiments of the current innovation enable on-the-fly adjustment of the calibration matrix based on an embedded algorithm that leverages statistical patterns in the gathered data, nullifying the requirement for external calibration signals. The described approach not only simplifies the system's operation but also reduces susceptibility to common perturbations such as environmental noise, ensuring a more stable and reliable calibration model. However, the details pertaining to obtaining a calibration dataset via an external source or considering the logistics of maintaining sterile environments, as well as handling pharmaceutical additives within the liquid medium, are deliberately omitted in order to focus on the core technological advancement.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a national Phase Patent Application of International Application Number PCT/DE01/03719, filed on Sep. 25, 2001, which claims priority of German Patent Application Number 100 49 734.9, filed on Sep. 28, 2000. BACKGROUND The invention relates to a method for determining, monitoring and updating correction data for correcting measured value distortions and for calibrating liquid-filled transmission systems. Liquid-filled transmission systems may be used for invasive intra-arterial and intravenous pressure measurement in cardiology, intensive care medicine and anaesthesia. In these systems the pressure measurement takes place in the body of a patient and is transmitted via the liquid-filled transmission system formed as a catheter to a pressure transducer arranged outside the body of the patient. As a function of the length, cross-section, construction, the elastic material properties of the catheter and the composition of the liquid located in the catheter, various resonances, dampings and energy losses of the measured value of the pressure detected as a signal from the patient at the end of the catheter inside the body occur and lead to substantial distortions of this signal from the patient owing to the fluid-filled transmission system. These distortions do not allow any quantitative analysis of the signals from the patient and impair the qualitative interpretation of the diagnosis and monitoring. To avoid distortions of the signals from the patient owing to the liquid-filled transmission system pressure measuring transducers known as tip pressure sensors were arranged at the tip of the catheter serving as the liquid-filled transmission system and the signal detected from the patient converted into an electrical signal and guided from the body of the patient via an electrical line. Tip pressure sensors of this type are very expensive, however, and only available to a limited extent with respect to their shape and size. A method for computer correction of measured value distortions by the liquid-filled transmission system in the transmission of a signal from the patient measured inside the body of a patient is known from DE 1 982 208 844 A1. In this reference the electrical signal from the (distorted) signal from the patient emitted by the external pressure transducer is guided through an analogue/digital transducer and the digitalised signal emitted is analysed in a signal analysis and processing unit operating on the basis of a digital Fourier analysis and carrying out a beat by beat analysis of the digitalised signal. The analysed signal is then linked with empirically determined correction data called up from a correction data record matrix or as a correction data record vector and output as Fourier coefficients. The signal corrected by the signal analysis and processing unit is finally guided to an output and/or evaluation unit. The correction data record required for this known method can be determined inter alia from a reference pressure measurement. In order to determine the transmission function, instead of the unknown measured signal, here an artificially generated known test pressure signal can be input as the reference signal, from the distortion of which the properties of the transmission system can then be concluded. One possibility is to obtain a calibration data record from a calibrator arranged on the catheter tip, but this necessitates the maintenance of sterile conditions, causes awkward handling and means that changes in the transmission function have to be taken into account as, for example, the catheter guided to the pressure measuring site and calibrator is rinsed, medication is supplied via the catheter and so-called \u201cmicrobubbles\u201d change the transmission function. If such changes take place, recalibration is required which, however, is not easy to carry out in the case of a horizontally located catheter, in other words in a catheter located in the body of the patient. A further possibility is to obtain a correction data record from the transmission function by means of an external calibration signal. For this purpose a calibration signal in the form of a jump signal, a pressure impact or a noise is transmitted at the side of the catheter remote from the measuring position, in other words outside the body of the patient, and the inherent oscillation produced in the process is used to calculate the correction data record. However, a plurality of problems occur in this type of determination of the transmission function by means of an external calibration signal. On the one hand, the calibration signal, i.e. the jump signal, the pressure impact or the noise have to be generated very precisely and in a reproducible manner and this necessitates measurements over a fairly long time period owing to the inconstant measuring behaviour of the transmission system and therefore cannot be implemented, for example in a hospital, owing to the high time and training input. On the other hand, use of an automatic mechanical device mounted to the pressure transducer, is very expensive and moreover, as a mechanical precision part, required special servicing for setting up and maintenance. There is the additional problem of signal separation during calibration in a horizontal catheter, as otherwise the measured jump response to a jump signal by the actual signal from the patient, for example a blood pressure signal is too greatly distorted and therefore incorrect correction data records are determined. The resultant dependency of the instant of the resolution of the jump signal, impact on the system or noise substantially restricts the reproducibility and causes substantial effort in particular in the case of irregular signals from the patient. A method for reducing the noise in an ECG signal is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,195, in which a pulse sequence corresponding to the heartbeat is selected and is converted into a multi-dimensional display using a brief Fourier transformation for evaluating the time/frequency display. In addition, a multi-dimensional filter function is used on the multi-dimensional display of the pulse sequence to thus raise the signal-to-noise ratio of the pulse sequence. The statistical attempts used in the process to correct the ECG signal pulse sequence only serve to eliminate simple disturbances in the pulse sequence, however, which can be assumed to be normally distributed and of which the band width can easily be separated from the band width of the useful signal. SUMMARY One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of the type mentioned at the outset which allows continuous monitoring and on-going updating of calibration data for a correction of measured value distortions of a signal from a patient without an external calibration signal and ensures a robust correction method which is not prone to faults with respect to artifacts and other disruptions contained in the measured signals. This may be achieved according to the invention by a method with the features of claim 1. The correction coefficients for a correction of measured value distortions in the frequency range for each frequency line are determined from statistics of the signals measured at this frequency. In the process empirically checked assumptions about the corresponding statistics from undistorted signals from patients and general properties of the transmission function are used. The achievement according to this embodiment of the invention allows determination, continuous monitoring and ongoing updating of the calibration data record for correcting the measured value distortions of signals from the patients without an external calibration signal and creates an economical correction method which is substantially easier to operate and to service compared to an external calibration device and is less prone to disruptions. The transmission function in the correction method being determined directly from the patient&#39;s signal. As advantageous configuration of the solution according to this embodiment of the invention is characterised in that the correction data are determined from the transmission function determined from the signal from the patient and in that in the determination of the correction data empirically checked assumptions about the corresponding statistics of undistorted signals from patients and general properties of the transmission function are used. The solution according to this embodiment of the invention allows the following procedure for determining, monitoring and updating the transmission function in the frequency range to obtain therefrom calibration data records, without an external calibration apparatus: 1. A (pressure) signal from the patient measured invasively by conventional catheter systems serves as the input signal. A possible variation to this is the use of the derived function of the pressure signal according to time instead of the original signal. 2. A segmentation of the signal then follows, either heartbeat by heartbeat or in the form of segments of signals from the patient which are suitable for a Fourier transformation with respect to their length. Suitable means here inter alia that from a minimum length, the sign change of the first derived function of the pressure according to time under the boundary condition of a minimum amount of the second derived function of the pressure according to time is sought. A further option for determining the suitable length is that from a minimum length, the minimum of the error in approximation of the pressure signal is determined by a Fourier series cut off in the higher frequency range. Further optional preprocessing steps are a linear trend adjustment and a multiplication of the segment. 3. There follows a complex Fourier transformation of the segments matched to the segment length and a transformation by means of zero padding in the case of a fast Fourier transformation. 4. The attempt to determine the transmission function is based on segment by segment statistics of the complex Fourier coefficients determined under Item 3. The signal model for a complex Fourier coefficient S i is, as the convolution presents a complex multiplication in the frequency range: S i =t i ( m i +v i ) With t i as the multiplicative component (convolution with transmission function), m i as the mean and v i as the variable portion of the Fourier coefficient S i determined from the measurement of the signal from the patient for the frequencies i=0... maximum. The number n of the segments or the segment by segment Fourier transformation for the statistics is determined such that (m n \u2212m n\u22121 ) 2 &lt;\u03b5(mean value stability) and \u03a3(s j \u2212m n ) 2 &gt;\u03b4(adequate variance for statistics) with m n the mean value of the complex Fourier coefficient in statistics of length n and s j the complex value of the Fourier coefficient in a repetition j with j=1... n and \u03b5 and \u03b4 as selected bounds. The optimum threshold values \u03b5 and \u03b4 have to be determined empirically here. 5. The following general assumptions about the signal from the patient are therefore used as a whole or partially for determining the transmission function. A good approximation is adequate for all the assumptions: 5.1 The transmission function remains constant over the time period for the statistics. 5.2 The signal from the patient contains a component which is variable even over short periods and is not strictly periodic. 5.3 The transmission function up to the first resonance corresponds to a second-order system. 5.4 The transmission function corresponds to the identity in the frequency range 1-2 Hz. 5.5 The transmission function can be ignored in the range of very high frequencies with amplitudes &lt;\u03b5 (noise virtually zero). 6. The transmission function is determined from the statistics of the form [\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) p ]/[\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) q ] or (m j ) p /m j ) q for all the frequency lines j=1... maximum and for i=1... n segments. For the parameters p and q, p&gt;q applies. Instead of mean values median values can also be used to stabilise the statistics with respect to freak values. A statistic of this type can be regarded according to the signal model as a sequence of complex Fourier coefficients. A derived sequence of coefficients with more uniform size distribution over the frequency range is obtained by complex differentiation or logarithmisation of the corresponding Fourier sequence. Furthermore, the parameters p and q are empirically determined. The special case p=1 and q=0 is permitted, for example for p=3 and q=2 it applies that with undistorted signals from the patient, the real part of the logarithm of the statistics [\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) 3 ]/[\u03a3( s ij \u2212m j ) 2 ] for all the j&#39;s decreased linearly with the logarithm of the frequency. A variation is the additional determination of higher-order moments and cumulants to improve the signal model by characterizing the distribution of the exciting signal. 7. The ratio of the actual statistics to the statistics to be expected in an undistorted signal from the patient or the weighted difference of these functions after logarithmic transformation is investigated to determine the transmission function. The determination of the cepstrum (homomorphic deconvolution) provides a possible variation for combination of the Fourier transformation according to Item 3 and the logarithmic transformation. 8. To reduce the noise in these statistics the following methods can be used individually or in combination: 8.1 an (optionally weighted) averaged summation of a plurality of consecutive determinations of the transmission function according to Item 7. 8.2 a slight coarsening of the spectral resolution by class formation for a plurality of frequency lines, 8.3 a flattening interpolation or use of a median or low-pass filter. There may also be a direct adaptation to a second-order system or another flat function, for example a spline function, with minimum deviation of the noisy transmission function determined from the statistics. 9. The damping coefficient and the resonance frequency or the amount of the transmission function for the individual frequency lines can be determined from the results under Item 8. As an alternative the resonance frequency can be determined directly from statistics of the form described under Item 6. This method allows an estimation of the damping. The logarithms of the mean values, for example and still better those of the medians correlate with the frequency. The gradient in the corresponding regression in the case of distorted signals from patient supplies an estimated value for the damping. The absolute amounts of the medians of higher frequencies are also smaller in the case of stronger damping. A plurality of estimated values for the resonance frequency and damping can be averaged with weighting with respect to their quality or combined by means of multiple regression models. Corresponding regression models may also be non-linear. Parameters for corresponding models can be determined from systematic in-vitro test series. Very stable and precise estimation of resonance frequency and damping can thus be obtained. 10. An iterative method with respect to items 7 to 8 can optionally be carried out to improve the results. 11. The phase can then be clearly calculated from the transmission function with the assumption of a second-order system or determined from further statistics of the form specified under Item 6, wherein the developed phase of the statistics in the form [\u03a3(s ij \u2212m j ) 3 ]/[\u03a3(s ij \u2212m j ) 2 ] in the case of undistorted signals from patient shows, in particular, a sigmoidal systematic relationship to the frequency. 12. The complex inverse of this function is clearly determined by computer from the amplitude and the phase of the transmission function determined in this way. This inverse is the correction data record for a correction in the frequency range, a segment by segment Fourier transformation of the measured pressure signals according to items 1 to 3 taking place.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 shows a basic structure of an invasive pressure measurement by means of a liquid-filled transmission system. A catheter 2 forming the liquid-filled transmission system is moved in the venous or arterial system of a patient 1 close to the point at which the system is to be measured. For example, for the impedance at the arterial vessel system, the catheter 2 is positioned close to where the pressure or a derived function of the pressure according to time is to be measured for measurement of the isovolumic contraction force or the like. To influence the patient 1 as little as possible by the catheter 2 , the catheter 2 has dimensions which are as small as possible and consists preferably of an elastic material and is formed in a hose-like manner. Located at the tip of the liquid-filled catheter 2 is an aperture, through which, for example, pressure pulses are picked up and passed on by the catheter 2 and a line which is also liquid-filled, to a pressure transducer 3."

  "negative": "The medical device in question is a novel self-retaining laryngoscope optimized for securing a clear airway in patients with difficult anatomical challenges. This laryngoscope comprises dual light-emitting blades offering enhanced visibility during the intubation process. The blades are engineered to expand and lock both horizontally and vertically, thus enabling one-handed operation, which facilitates maneuverability and efficiency for the healthcare provider. The structural design includes a pair of blades, one acting as a tongue depressor and the other as an epiglottis lifter, effectively widening the airway passage while simultaneously minimizing tissue trauma. The blades are crafted from a light-transmitting material to ensure consistent illumination throughout. Moreover, this device integrates a locking mechanism that secures the blades in an expanded state, thus freeing up the practitioner's hands to focus on other critical aspects of airway management. These user-friendly features ensure an effective, non-invasive approach to airway management, particularly useful in emergency situations or ambulatory settings where rapid and reliable intubation is paramount. Additionally, the disposable nature promotes optimal hygiene standards and reduces the risk of cross-contamination between patients. As its design negates the need for sterilization processes between uses, healthcare facilities may find it beneficial in terms of both cost and time efficiency.\n",
  "pos": "STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to medical devices and more specifically to disposable self-retaining laryngoscopes useful for orally intubating a patient with an endotracheal tube. 2. Background of the Prior Art Laryngoscopes have long been used to open the mouth and airway to allow examination of the larynx and to assist in oral intubation of the compromised airway with an endotracheal tube. To better understand the present invention, it is useful to review the prior art and the current state of the art in laryngoscopes. It is also necessary to understand why laryngoscope aided intubation is clinically important; why it is frequently difficult or impossible to accomplish with the prior art and to briefly discuss the consequences to the patient that can be caused by problems resulting from the use of prior art laryngoscopes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,570,614, which issued to Bauman on Feb. 18, 1986, teaches a laryngoscope with a single disposable nonmetallic blade, a light source disposed within the handle and a light conductor disposed adjacent to and held by the blade. Typical of the prior art, this apparatus requires two hands to operate, and perhaps even two caregivers, if the patient&#39;s mouth and head must be stabilized. Lacy (U.S. Pat. No. 5,355,870) and Bar-Or et. al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,351) also teach disposable plastic single blades used in combination with a light source in a laryngoscope. U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,451, which issued to Bauman on Mar. 4, 1986, teaches a laryngoscope blade which has a tip that is capable being bent or flexed in the direction of the handle of the laryngoscope. This allows the patient&#39;s epiglottis to be lifted to expose the patient&#39;s larynx. This is a single blade instrument. It is provided with a ratchet lock to maintain the bend in the tip. This instrument can bend in only one direction, to lift the epiglottis. Locking the laryngoscope blade in an operable position is also shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,760, but this lock/unlock mechanism functions to enable the instrument to be compact when it is not in use. U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,835, which issued to Filli on Aug. 6, 1991, teaches a slideably adjustable spatula portion in the laryngoscope blade. The function of this spatula is to act as a tongue depressor to facilitate inspection of the pharynx and larynx, or the insertion of an anesthetic breathing tube. This apparatus uses a single blade with a sliding part, which does not lock in position. U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,859, which issued to Waldvogel on Dec. 10, 1991, teaches a laryngoscope that incorporates a dynamometer in order to measure the force used by the caregiver to examine the patient. This invention is an attempt to avoid trauma to the patient that can occur using prior art apparatus. U.S. Pat. No. 4,517,964, which issued to Upsher on May 21, 1985, teaches a dual bladed laryngoscope, wherein one conventional blade carries its own light source and the second blade is a light guide for a second light source in the handle of the instrument. The closest prior art known to the present inventor is U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,231, which issued to Franicevic on Mar. 12, 1996. This apparatus is the current state of the art in the field of laryngoscopes. Franicevic teaches a reusable laryngoscope for use &#34;in difficult intubation due to malformation of the jaws, tongue, pharynx, larynx or neck as a result of trauma, edema, inflammation or congenial anomalies.&#34; This laryngoscope has a hollow body terminating at its distal end in a pair of opposed blades that can be spread apart by the caregiver. An endotracheal tube slides through the hollow tube in the center of the instrument. Light conducting means are provided to illuminate the larynx. The device includes a fiberoptic optical system for inspecting the larynx during intubation. Franicevic is an improvement on the `bendable tip` of Bauman, cited above. The single distal spreading of the `beak` taught by Franicevic allows some lifting of the soft tissue, but it does nothing to open the mouth or depress the tongue. Franicevic teaches a bias spring to keep the distal blades closed when they are not positively spread apart by the caregiver. This apparatus is not locking or self-retaining in the airway. It also is not disposable and its complex mechanism makes it difficult to adequately sterilize. Intubation using prior art laryngoscopes requires at least two hands. Four hands may be needed to hold the head and mouth of the patient, operate the laryngoscope and intubate the patient. Prior art instruments are either reusable; and thus present risk of disease to the caregiver; or they use disposable single plastic blades, which become covered with blood and fail to light the airway. This can make it difficult or impossible to intubate the patient, even if the procedure is done in a hospital and the airway is normal. These problems become much more severe in the field; during emergency transportation of the patient; or when attempting to intubate an abnormal or damaged airway. When the prior art fails, effects on the patient are often severe. Respiratory related mishaps are a major source of patient morbidity and mortality. Should a difficult airway problem arise, approximately 40% will result in death, 20% in brain damage and 40% in high morbidity trauma. The incidence of difficulty in intubation is said to be between 1.2 and 2.5%, about 1 in 65 patients. This is a major medical problem, especially for the practitioner of emergency medicine. The number of different variations of laryngoscope found in the prior art is a good indication that many experts skilled in this art have tried to find solutions to these problems. The causes of difficulty in endotracheal intubation are either congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include conditions such as: Pierre Robin syndrome. Cystic hygroma. Treacher-Collins syndrome. Gargoylism. Achondroplasia. Marfan&#39;s syndrome. Numerous anatomical features have been identified that make endotracheal intubation difficult, especially in trauma patient who must be treated promptly in the field or during transport to a hospital. These include: excessive weight. short muscular neck and a full set of teeth. protruding incisors. long high arched palate with long narrow mouth. receding mandible. large swellings in the neck, mouth or upper chest. decreased distance between the occiput and the spinous process of C.1. increase in posterior depth of the mandible. increase in alveolar--mental distance requiring wide opening of the mandible. Endotracheal intubation using prior art laryngoscopes may also be difficult or impossible because of acute swelling in the neck due to trauma or bleeding. Intubation may be difficult if flexion of the neck is contraindicated because of cervical spine injury or severe rheumatoid arthritis. The following categories of patients require a definitively secured airway: 1. Apnoea 2. &lt;9 or sustained seizure activity. 3. Unstable mid-face trauma. 4. Airway injuries. 5. Large flail segment or respiratory failure. 6. High aspiration risk. 7. Inability to otherwise maintain an airway or oxygenation. The urgency of airway intubation is the most important factor in planning which technique of securing the airway is the safest and most appropriate. The caregiver must evaluate and assess the risk of further cord injury given head and neck movement, the degree of cooperation from the patient, anatomy and trauma to the airway and the caregiver&#39;s own expertise in each technique. Initially the airway should be cleared of debris, blood and secretions. It should be opened using the `chin lift` or `jaw thrust` maneuvers. The `sniffing the morning air` position for standard tracheal intubation flexes the lower cervical spine and extends the occiput on the atlas. An oral (Guedel) or nasopharyngeal airway may be necessary to maintain patency until a definitive airway is secured. Insertion of an airway produces minimal disturbance to the cervical spine. Bag and mask ventilation also produces a significant degree of movement at zones of instability. The ATLS recommends a nasotracheal tube in the spontaneously breathing patient, and orotracheal intubation in the apnoeic patient. MANUAL in-line axial stabilization must be maintained throughout. The hard collar may interfere with intubation efforts and the front part may be removed to facilitate intubation as long as manual stabilization is in effect. Blind nasal intubation is successful in 90% of patients but requires multiple attempts in up to 90% of these. Nasotracheal intubation is (relatively) contraindicated in patients with potential basillar skull fracture or unstable mid-face injuries. In addition, it may produce hemorrhage in the airway, making other airway manipulations difficult or impossible. Orotracheal intubation is generally accepted as the more usual method for securing the airway in the trauma patient. It is the fastest and surest method of intubating the trachea. At Shock Trauma in Baltimore, Md. (Grande C. M., Barton C. R., Stene J. K. &#34;Appropriate Techniques for Airway Management of Emergency Patients with Suspected Spinal Cord Injury.&#34; Anesth Analg 1988;67:714-715) more than 3000 patients were intubated orally with a modified rapid sequence induction technique with pre-oxygenation and cricoid pressure. Ten percent of these patients were found to have cervical spine injury and none deteriorated neurologically following intubation. Awake intubation is also a feasible option and is favored by some practitioners. It may be performed via the nasotracheal route, direct oral laryngoscopy or by fibreoptic technique. Successful fibreoptic tracheal intubation requires a cooperative patient, a secretion and blood free airway, a pharynx unrestricted by oedema and adequate supraglottic and infraglottic anesthesia. Such ideal conditions often do not exist, and local anaesthetic preparation of the airway is time consuming and might increase the risk of aspiration even if done in a proper hospital. Failed or difficult intubation is always a problem. Some nontramatic causes are: A. difficult blade insertion in the obese patient B. absence of any landmarks C. ineffective lighting D. inability to pass endotracheal tube Complications of direct laryngoscopy and intubation as taught by the prior art can be severe and can include: A. hypoxia B. esophageal intubation C. glottic and epiglottic edema D. vocal cord injury E. tracheal perforation F. dental trauma G. endobronchial intubation H. pulmonary aspiration I. laryngospasm J. bronchospasm K. cervical spine injury L. increased intracranial pressure M. increased intraoculary pressure N. pulmonary edema In addition to these risks to the patient, most prior art laryngoscopes are reused. This is always true of complex designs, such as the laryngoscope taught by Franicevic, cited above. Such prior art laryngoscopes can present a risk of disease to the caregiver because they are often not possible to completely sterilize them after use. In most cases they are even not sterilized, but just washed by hand. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a self-retaining disposable laryngoscope having dual light conductive blades that open and lock apart laterally and/or radially. The invention has two curved blades: a tongue blade and a palate blade. These two blades may be separated and locked apart by a ratchet mechanism in the instrument&#39;s handle while they remain parallel. This provides a bite block, pushes down the tongue, and makes the invention self-retaining in the airway. The palate blade may be rotated about an axis in the handle of the instrument and locked in position by a ratchet mechanism to spread the distal ends of the blades. This lifts the tongue and epiglottis and opens the airway. Both plastic blades are light conductors for a source of light located in the handle. Light from both blades assures that one blade being covered with blood will not prevent adequate light from illuminating the airway. The present invention may be operated with one hand initially and then locked, freeing both hands because the blades lock into position in the airway when they are separated and/or rotated. It is therefore a principle object of the present invention to provide a dual blade laryngoscope whose blades can lock open both laterally and radially to allow endotracheal intubation of the difficult airway. A further object of the present invention is to provide a laryngoscope capable of simultaneously opening the mouth, lifting the tongue and lifting the epiglottis, whereby it is self-retaining in the airway. Another object of the present invention is to provide a laryngoscope that adequately lights the airway during intubation even if one blade of the instrument is obscured by blood or foreign material. A further object of the present invention is to provide a laryngoscope that provides a bite block to prevent dental trauma, and to protect integrity of the airway and personnel. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a laryngoscope that is inexpensive and disposable. An important object of the present invention is to provide a laryngoscope that may be operated with one hand and by caregivers not trained as experts at endotracheal intubation BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a side view of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a side view of the palate blade of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a top view of the palate blade of the present invention; FIG. 4 is a side view of the tongue blade of the present invention; FIG. 5 is a front view of the tongue blade of the present invention; FIG. 6 is a top view of the tongue blade of the present invention; FIG. 7 is a section view of the tongue blade taken along section lines 7--7 of FIG. 6; FIG. 8 is a side view of the slide/rotary ratchet mechanism of the present invention; FIG. 9 is a rear view of the slide/rotary ratchet mechanism of the present invention; FIG. 10 is a section view taken along section lines 10--10 of FIG. 8; and FIG. 11 is a table showing typical dimensions of the drawings shown in FIGS. 1-10 for small, medium and large laryngoscopes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIGS. 1 to FIG. 10, inclusive, show preferred angles and dimensions of the best embodiment of the present invention known to the inventor. In some cases distances are marked with letters of the alphabet rather than numeric values. This is done because laryngoscopes must be made in several sizes, for children and adults, as well as to take into account the normal size variations in patients. The values for these dimensions are given in the table shown in FIG. 11. It is the intention of the inventor to thereby give a sufficient disclosure of the present invention to allow any person skilled in the art of making laryngoscopes the ability to make and use the present invention without undue experimentation. FIG. 1 shows a side view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Structurally, In FIG. 1, laryngoscope 101 has a curved palate blade 103 having a palate blade tip 109. Laryngoscope 101 also has a tongue blade 105 having a tongue blade tip 107. Blades 103 and 105 are curved in a manner well known to those skilled in the art and are roughly parallel to each other. Palate blade 103 has a rotation axis 111 and a lever portion 113. Lever portion 113 is adapted to operable receive ratchet member 115 of ratchet mechanism 117. Ratchet mechanism 117 is part of lateral/radial ratchet assembly 133. The lower part 135 of assembly 133 has a hole for receiving axis 111. Tongue blade 105 has an upright portion 119 that has a ratchet mechanism 121. Ratchet 121 engages tip 125 of rocker lever 123. Lever 123 is attached to assembly 133 by semi-rigid shaft 127. Lever 123 has a lower part 129 that is equipped with finger knurls 131. A battery, switch and light source, not shown, are disposed within upright member 119. Blades 103 and 105 are made by injection molding of any plastic that is suitable for medical devices and capable of conducting light along the length of the blades. Assembly 133 is made by injection molding from any plastic suitable for medical use that is strong and resilient enough to allow the ratchet mechanisms to operate reliably. Functionally, laryngoscope 101 operates as follows. The patient&#39;s head is stabilized. The mouth is opened. Blades 103 and 105 are proximate each other and are placed into the airway. With the thumb of the one hand holding the laryngoscope, the caregiver pushes rocker lever 123 and slides palate blade 103 away from tongue blade 105. As this is done, the end 125 of lever 123 engages ratchet 121 of the upright part 119 of blade 105. The result is that blades 103 and 105 separate and lock apart while remaining in parallel. This depresses the tongue and elevates the palate. The patient&#39;s mouth is opened wide and locked open by the laryngoscope, which also acts as a bite block. The patient&#39;s airway is illuminated by light from both blades of the invention. Natural tension of the patient&#39;s jaw and mouth makes the invention self-retaining in the patient&#39;s airway. It remains in place without requiring either the hands or attention of the caregiver until lever 129 is pressed, which releases lever 125 from ratchet mechanism 121 and allows blades 103 to return to its original position adjacent to blade 105. When laryngoscope 101 has its two blades 103 and 105 laterally separated and locked by the ratchet mechanism of the invention in the patient&#39;s airway, the entire attention of the caregiver can be directed to the work of intubation. If necessary, the caregiver may press lever section 113 of palate blade 103 towards the handle of the invention using the thumb of the hand holding the laryngoscope. When lever section 133 is moved toward assembly 113, it rotates palate blade 103 about axis 111 and causes palate blade tip 109 to separate at its distal end from the tip 107 of tongue blade 105. As this happens, ratchet member 115 of lever 113 engages ratchet mechanism 117 of assembly 133 to lock the blade tips apart. This action at the blade tips lifts the soft tissue and exposes the larynx."

It acts as a protective barrier that isolates the body from the surrounding medium, protecting it and contributing to preserve its structures intact, whilst acting as a communication system with the environment. The skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the most superficial layer, the dermis, which is the intermediate layer, and the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, which is the deepest layer of the skin. [0003] Since it is the outermost organ, the skin is subjected to significant deterioration and aggression, which leads to premature ageing of the skin. The external factors that act thereon include excess solar radiation, atmospheric contamination, abusive use of surfactants, tobacco smoke, etc. But the skin may also suffer from premature ageing as a result of internal or endogenous factors, such as those related to an unbalanced nutrition in terms of vitamins, iatrogenic factors such as radiotherapy, the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, etc., or the presence in the body of very reactive toxins such as those ingested by drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. Natural ageing also occurs as a consequence, for example, of the production of free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA alterations, etc. [0004] Deterioration of the skin appears in the form of wrinkles, spots, laxity, benign neoplasms, etc. [0005] Numerous cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions have been disclosed for treatment of the skin, and the care and cleaning thereof, composed of very different ingredients, which include plant extracts and animal extracts. In this regard, one of the ingredients used in the preparation of skin care cosmetics have been gastropod secretions, what is commonly referred to as snail slime. Thus, for example, document DE1813154 discloses a composition designed for skin care that contains a fat and one or more active agents, which contains the slippery lubricating secretion excreted by a snail, particularly Helix pomatia. Patent FR2595247 discloses that extracts from the mucous membranes or digestive juices of gastropods are useful in cosmetics at concentrations ranging between 0.1%-10% due to their moisturising action on the epidermal surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,740 discloses an active ingredient for cosmetic or therapeutic compositions obtained from the secretion of a centrifuged live gastropod, and said compositions may be applied to skin care. [0006] On the other hand, document CA2611645 discloses the use of a Helix aspersa \u201csnail slime\u201d product to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells in vitro. [0007] A stem cell is a cell that has the capacity to renew itself by means of mitotic divisions or to continue the differentiation pathway for which it is programmed. Moreover, it is capable of producing cells of one or more mature, functional, fully differentiated tissues, as a function of its degree of multipotentiality. Most of the tissues of an adult individual have their own specific population of stem cells which allow for their periodical renewal or their regeneration when tissue damage occurs. In particular, the epidermis undergoes constant renewal and consists of a stratified squamous epithelium associated with pilose follicles and sebaceous glands. These specialised structures are maintained by the self-renewal of epidermal stem cells and the differentiation of the offspring thereof. Skin stem cells are crucial for the healing of wounds and the regeneration of the skin and the hair. However, the capacity of stem cells may be diminished due to genetic problems, environmental influences and the ageing process. Therefore, the protection of stem cells is extremely important. [0008] Although snail secretions are known to be useful for the preparation of skin cosmetics, thus far no product derived from snail spawn has been disclosed for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions that has a proven action on skin stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof and, consequently, preventing and correcting ageing of the skin. [0009] In this regard, the present invention discloses a product obtained from gastropod spawn for the preparation of cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions which has been shown to have very beneficial effects on the skin, preventing and correcting the ageing thereof by acting directly on epithelial stem cells. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0010] The object of the present invention consists of a product prepared from gastropod spawn of the family Helicidae, which is used for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions for the skin. Said product has the capacity to act on stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof as a consequence of ageing of the skin caused by both endogenous and exogenous stressful factors. [0011] The product is composed of organic and inorganic molecules from snail spawn, the organic molecules being polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, peptides and amino acids, where the proteins and glycoproteins present a characteristic electrophoretic pattern, similar to that shown in FIG. 1 , and the inorganic molecules being cations and anions such as phosphate, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium, in their most stable ion forms. [0012] The product derived from snail spawn is used in the preparation of dermo-cosmetic compositions in the form of serum, solutions, injectables (monodose), gel (Hydragel), o/w gel-cream, w/o gel-cream, o/w cream, w/o cream, w/s cream, o/w/o cream, extemporaneous facial mask preparations, patches and, in general, all dermo-cosmetic (cosmeceutical) forms that may be used in the formulation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical products. Said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, facilitates the rescue of skin stem cells intended to disappear due to senescence or endogenous or exogenous aggressions, and promotes the activation of said cells, as shown in Example 2 of the present specification. This activation is characterised by premature induction of DNA replication during cell division. [0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18\u00b0 C.-24\u00b0 C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21\u00b0 C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0023] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2\u00b0 C. and 8\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration of 70% (w/w), in purified water; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a Silverson mill; they are filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of a cream, using it at a 70% concentration. Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or \u201cbulge\u201d (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (\u201cbulge\u201d) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4\u00b0 C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4\u00b0 C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5\u00d70.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group."

  "query": "What novel methodologies for producing stable suspensions of small size magnetic particles with biologically active coatings are proposed in the patent field?,",
  "negative": "The instant disclosure relates to a novel development in creating durable mixtures of magnetic elements and the processes of formulating resuspendable layered magnetic elements, mainly used in chemical or medicinal applications. Such magnetic elements serve a crucial role in several isolating and analytical processes. Utilization of magnetic forces enables the segregation of these elements from solutions when linked to targeted chemical components. These capabilities also extend to their use as imaging enhancers in certain scanning modalities. The term 'resuspendable layered particle' within this context relates to minuscule solids capable of forming colloid-like mixtures, with the ability to be separated and then redistributed in a medium. 'Magnetic' implies the responsiveness of the material to magnetic influences although not permanently magnetic, and may include paramagnetic or superparamagnetic properties. 'Fragmented' elements reference those of insufficient size to accommodate a complete magnetic area or ones where thermal motion surpasses their magnetic potential, with sizes often less than 0.03 micron. Alternative strategies to magnetic elements synthesis have previously been explored, leading to various categories such as large, tiny, and cluster formations of tiny elements. Large elements, susceptible to even weak magnetic fields due to their size, tend to precipitate swiftly from solutions and hold restricted surface area for their mass. Small elements avoid such precipitations due to thermal motion but clusters of these can remain in solution for extended durations. Particularly, elements with ferromagnetic crystals shrink to 'superparamagnetic' when their crystal dimensions are below approximately 0.03\u03bc. Such materials exhibit magnetic tendencies only within magnetic gradients and do not retain permanent magnetism. Without reference to specific patents, applications, or devices, the emphasis is placed on the innovative methods of producing magnetic elements with a biological tilt, culminating in a new generation of materials exhibiting enhanced stabilities in high ionic compounds, such as those seen in typical biological and bio-processing matrices.\n",
  "pos": "RELATED INVENTIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/482,448, filed Jun. 7, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,271, Dec. 16, 1997, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in the present specification as if set forth herein in full. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to stable suspensions of magnetic particles and to resuspendable coated magnetic particles, preferably, but not limited to, those having biochemical or biological activity, to compositions including such particles, and to methods of making and using such particles and compositions. Biologically active magnetic particles find use in a variety of preparative and diagnostic techniques. Among these is high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) which uses a magnetic field to separate magnetic particles from suspension. In instances where these particles are attached to biological materials of interest (e.g., cells, drugs), the material of interest or target material may thereby be separated from other materials not bound to the magnetic particles. Because of their magnetic properties, these materials also function as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. As used herein, the term &#34;resuspendable coated particle&#34; refers to a finely divided solid, which forms a colloidal suspension and may be separated from the suspension and subsequently resuspended. &#34;Magnetic&#34; encompasses material which may or may not be permanently magnetic, which also may be paramagnetic or superparamagnetic but which in all cases exhibits a response in a magnetic field, i.e., is magnetically responsive. &#34;Disrupted&#34; particles are those which are too small to contain a complete magnetic domain or, alternatively, whose Brownian energy exceeds their magnetic moment. Generally, these particles are less than 0.03 micron in size. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART Many techniques have been suggested in the prior art for the preparation of magnetic particles or organo-magnetic materials. Such particles generally fall into three categories: large, small and microagglomerates of small particles. Large magnetic particles, having diameters greater than 10 micron (\u03bc) respond to weak magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients. Because of their size, they tend to settle rapidly from solution and also have limited surface area per unit weight. Large particles also tend to aggregate after they have been subjected to a magnetic field because they can be permanently magnetized. Small particles which have magnetic cores of mean diameter less than 0.03\u03bc remain in solution by virtue of their Brownian energy and hence do not spontaneously settle. Microagglomerates of such small magnetic particles have been prepared by various methods. Depending on the size of the microagglomerates, materials which can remain in solution for reasonable periods of time can be prepared. Additionally, the magnetic properties of small particles and microagglomerates of small magnetic particles are significantly different from those of the larger permanently magnetizable particles. Small magnetic particles composed of either single crystals of ferromagnetic materials such as iron oxides or agglomerates of such crystals become &#34;superparamagnetic&#34; when the crystal size of the ferromagnetic materials is below about 0.03\u03bc. Unlike ferromagnetic crystals, superparamagnetic crystals only exhibit magnetic behavior when they are in a magnetic field gradient and do not become permanently magnetized. Such materials have been referred to as dispersible magnetic metal oxide particles and also as magnetically responsive particles. One possible route to obtaining a magnetic particle bearing a bioreceptor is that of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,970,518 and 4,018,886 to Giaever, which teach the physical coating of such materials onto the magnetic particles via adsorption. The coating of bovine serum albumin onto 1\u03bc diameter nickel particles is exemplified. U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,685 to Senyei et al. considers the teaching of U.S. Pat. No. 3,970,518 and states that there is &#34;no literature verification that uncoated magnetic particles can effectively be made to bind with antibody&#34; and presumably other bioreceptors. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,088 to Whitehead et al. states that antibodies adsorbed on iron oxides are substantially detached by 24-hour 50\u00b0 incubation in 1M sodium chloride and also that the quantity of adsorbed material is low. With respect to one type of superparamagnetic particle described herein, namely, colloidal particles, the method of recovery proposed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,970,518 and 4,018,886 could not easily be made to work on such colloidal particles, as the field strength required to capture such particles for washing away unadsorbed materials would be enormous. Additionally, a field gradient is required, which is not achievable with the apparatus there described. In conjunction with the preparative use of high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS), the concept of Giaever might work where there are effective means for adsorbing and retaining antibodies or bioreceptors on such particles. In view of the apparent failure to produce functionally acceptable magnetic particles via bioreceptor adsorption, a number of other approaches have been pursued. These include U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,685 to Senyei et al., which discloses the preparation of microspheres containing magnetite, albumin, and protein A. The preparation taught by Senyei involves an emulsion polymerization of the above ingredients. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,088 to Whitehead et al. teaches the silanation of magnetic metal oxides which subsequently can be covalently linked to bioactive molecules. Both of the immediately preceding approaches deal with agglomerated superparamagnetic particles; hence, the agglomerated materials are classed as magnetically responsive. Other patents which may be considered to be of interest include U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,210 to Robinson et al.; 4,335,094 to Mosbach; and 4,070,246 to Kennedy et al. While these patents disclose the preparation or use of magnetic-biologic particles, none of these are considered to be similar to those of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,454,234 to Czerlinski is directed to magnetically-responsive microparticles suitable for use in preparing selectively reversible suspensions thereof and the method of making such microparticles. The microparticle core comprises a single particle of magnetically-responsive material having a Curie temperature within the range of 5\u00b0 C.-65\u00b0 C. The method for preparing these microparticles involves the steps of pulverizing and fractionating magnetic substances, which steps are carried out above the Curie temperature to provide the desired microcores, followed by coating the resulting microcores, also above the Curie temperature. According to the disclosure of the Czerlinski patent, these steps are purposely carried out above the Curie temperature of the magnetically-responsive microparticles to avoid the possibilities of magnetic attraction that occurs between small particles in suspension. U.S. Pat. No. 4,452,773 to Molday discloses &#34;colloidal&#34; iron oxide particles coated with non-ionic polysaccharide by forming magnetite in 25% (w/w) polysaccharide solutions. Molday further teaches the covalent linking of bioactive molecules to such formed particles by well-known chemical linking technology. U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,698 to Owen et al., which is incorporated by reference herein, teaches the preparation of colloidal sized metal oxide particles which are coated in what is believed to be essentially a covalent manner by polymers or proteins which have substantial numbers of unpaired electrons. Bioactive molecules such as antibodies or enzymes retain biological activity in the Owen et al. process which involves (1) the coprecipitation of transition element oxides and polymer or protein at 0.1 to 1 mg/ml by titration with base to slightly alkaline pH, (2) the subsequent washing of the coprecipitate and (3) the resuspension of the coprecipitate in appropriate buffers followed by mild sonication resulting in colloidal magnetically responsive particles. A colloidal dispersion of magnetic particles in rocket fuel is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,215,572 to Papell. The dispersion is said to include magnetic particles, such as magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), 0.25\u03bc in diameter and smaller, preferably less than 0.10\u03bc in diameter. The dispersion is produced by ball milling a suspension of larger particle size magnetic particles in the propellant, with a grinding agent which prevents &#34;agglomeration or welding of the minute particles as grinding progresses&#34; (column 2, lines 33-34). The ball mill includes metal balls to produce the grinding action. The grinding agent, generally included at levels on the order of 2% but possibly up to 10%, typically comprises oleic acid; it is further disclosed, however, that other grinding agents such as stearic acid and cetyl alcohol may be utilized in the production of a magnetic propellant and other long chain hydrocarbons having similar high surface tensions, such as benzene, ethane, hydrazine and gasoline may be utilized as the particle carrier and major constituent of the magnetic propellant (column 4, lines 5-6). U.S. application Ser. No. 397,106 discloses a method for producing polymer/protein coated magnetic particles which involves disrupting pre-formed crystal agglomerates (magnetite related transition element oxides) in the presence of coating material to produce materials which are in the 25 nm to micron size range. The size of the resultant product depends on the degree and conditions for disruption and the ratio of coat material to crystal agglomerates. Sonication under various conditions is disclosed as the method of choice. For polymer coated materials this process has major advantage over those where metal oxides are formed in situ in the presence of coat material, such as in Molday or Owen. By separating the process of preparing transition element oxide crystals from the coating step interference of coat material in the former process is avoided. Such interference can result in a variety of disadvantages such as heterogeneous crystal growth, difficulty in controlling the oxide process and imperfections in crystals, all of which can compromise the final product. Application Ser. No. 08/231,379, which is a CIP of U.S. application Ser. No. 397,106 relates to another modification which in many respects constitutes an improvement upon the above described process, wherein crystal agglomerate disruption is performed in the absence of coating material. That modification has advantage when material to be coated is adversely affected by the disruption process. Another advantage of separating the disruption from the coating step is that the presence of coating material can inhibit disruption by linking two crystal agglomerates together thus interfering with the disruption process. Despite the simplicity of the processes described in the last mentioned patent applications and the utility of the resultant material, materials derived from these processes are limited in certain respects. One limitation of these materials is their loss of stability in moderate (0.01M) ionic strength buffers which causes them to agglomerate and eventually settle from solution. Thus in the manufacturing process variation in ionic strength which leads to agglomeration should be avoided. Further such materials will generally only resuspend after magnetic collection if they are in buffers of low ionic strength. Even then, repeated magnetic collection and resuspension can lead to agglomerates. This property can, however, be advantageous as in the case of doing immunoassays in serum or ionic strength buffers near 0.15M. Since these media lead to some agglomeration during the incubation period of the assay and since agglomerates require smaller magnetic gradients to be pulled from solution, this property which is undesirable in some instances becomes a positive benefit and permits the use of material of smaller size than would be the case in the absence this phenomenon or alternatively allows the use of lower magnetic gradient separation devices. On the other hand, there are many applications where size integrity of the magnetic colloid is very important and where such agglomeration is highly undesirable. One example would be the use of these materials in laboratory or bioprocessing isolations of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from ascites fluid or from culture. Typically such media are at physiological ionic strength (0.15 M) and, for example, when Protein A is used to bind MAbs and subsequently desorb MAbs, buffers of such ionic strength or considerably higher are used. There are also instances in immunoassay where agglomeration is not desirable, such as dual stage incubations. For example, to assay for chronic hepatitis, a typical approach would involve incubating ferrofluid specific for human IgM with patient serum so as to capture the IgM in the sample. Capture would be accomplished by magnetically separating the capture material and subsequently washing out non specific proteins. Next the ferrofluid bearing patient IgM would be incubated with excess labeled hepatitis antigen, separated again, washed and the label detected by some appropriate means. The dual incubations of this process and the two separations require a material that will be stable to both moderate ionic strength and to multiple magnetic separations and resuspensions. During the course of extensive research and development on the above processes, several observations have led to the speculation that the problem of high ionic strength colloidal instability might be due to incomplete crystal agglomerate coverage by the coat polymer/proteins employed. Further, even though it is very difficult to calculate accurately the surface area of such agglomerates and the amount of coat material which should be adsorbed thereon as a monolayer, calculation does suggest that incomplete coverage is a possibility. From extensive experience with dispersed magnetite crystal agglomerates, it is apparent that surface charge is critical to keeping the agglomerates dispersed. This can be seen by performing a simple experiment such as sonicating magnetite in low ionic strength phosphate buffer (10-20 mM). Such a process will result in a transitionally stable dispersion. If such material, while in the dispersed state, is magnetically collected it will be found to not resuspend. The dispersion can also quickly be agglomerated by merely increasing the ionic strength with simple salts. Further evidence suggesting that this process does not result in complete coating is: (1) anionic polymer, dextran or bovine serum albumin (BSA) coated materials non-specifically stick to mammalian cells, and binding can in part be diminished with anionic polymers which can compete with cell surface sialic acid for &#34;bare spots&#34; which would have positive charge due to iron atoms at the crystal surfaces (see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/976,476); (2) a substantial portion of material collected by HGMS using very fine steel wool (gradients in excess of 150 kGauss/cm) aggregates in the process; and (3) the size of materials is affected by ionic strength and at ionic strengths as low as 0.02 M agglomeration can be observed. It would be desirable to have a well coated particulate base material for several reasons. By coating material to a greater degree with a hydrophilic coating, stability in high ionic strength media should be achievable, covering &#34;bare spots&#34; should reduce non-specific binding to cell surfaces, and better coated material should generally permit greater amounts of bioreceptor to be coupled yielding higher bioactivity. There are also process advantages that should accrue since better coated materials can be magnetically collected and resuspended without fear of crystal--crystal interaction which will lead to aggregation. The independence of such processes from concerns of high ionic strength induced aggregation also would be of significant benefit in various manufacturing steps such as purification. Clearly it is simpler to employ magnetics to remove unbound reagent in some particular step rather than to employ column chromatography. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the production of magnetically responsive superparamagnetic particles which are colloidally stable in high ionic strength systems, e.g. 1.0 to 2.0 M NaCl, and which can repeatedly be subjected to high gradient magnetic separation and resuspension without growth in size as would be evidenced by the appearance of turbidity or particle size growth. Such materials provide process advantages in manufacture which significantly decrease cost of production. These advantages include the ability to repeatedly separate the resultant particles from reagents via magnetic separation rather than using column chromatography, a significantly greater latitude in choice of buffers (types and buffer strengths) which can be used in these processes and also in coupling chemistries or modification/derivatization reactions. These materials also have a significantly greater ability to be filter sterilized (for materials below 200 nm) as regards the amount of product which passes such filters. Further, they are compatible with a greater choice of filter material. These materials also demonstrate significantly lower nonspecific binding, particularly to mammalian cells. This new class of material also has significant application advantages such as ability to undergo repeated separation and resuspension as is often required for multi-incubation assays. Due to their increased content of coating material, they have a greater ability to couple greater amounts of bioligand to them. In such applications where the presence of these materials quenches or absorbs developed signal, such as in chemiluminescent immunoassays or nucleic acid detection, the higher biological activity results in the ability to use less material, which results in greater signal output. This higher biological activity as well as colloidal stability under a wide range of conditions typically found in biological and bioprocessing systems and likely to be found in various other manufacturing applications or processes gives these materials significant advantage over magnetic-polymer particles made by previously available procedures. These materials indeed represent a significant advance over the prior art for coating clusters of crystals of various transition element oxides, and particularly magnetite. Magnetic particles of small size (maximum particle size generally below 0.2\u03bc) with a stabilizing (preferably biochemically or biologically active) coating, are produced, in accordance with one embodiment of the process of the invention, by forming a suspension of somewhat larger size parent magnetic particles (believed to be agglomerates), together with a material adapted to form a coating on the relatively smaller, subdivided &#34;sub-particles&#34; upon subdivision of the parent particles. This mixture is then treated to subdivide or disrupt the parent particles and to maintain those particles in that state, and subjecting the mixture to appropriate heating to form a coating on the deagglomerated or subdivided particles, thus stabilizing them at reduced particle size. The product is a stable suspension. With the proper selection of coating material, the coated, subdivided particle product can be separated and resuspended. The resultant resuspendable product, if the stabilizing coating is a bioactive compound or ligand, is particularly useful as an MRI contrast agent, for bioanalytical applications and for industrial bioprocessing. The magnetic particles of the invention can also be prepared by an alternative direct coating process performed on a transiently stable particulate magnetic substrate, which is further described hereinbelow. In carrying out this embodiment of the invention, a particulate magnetic starting material is divided into a plurality of smaller sized particles with the ability to aggregate, thereby providing a bare or uncoated particulate magnetic substrate. The particulate magnetic substrate thus obtained, which is suspended in a suitable liquid medium, is then contacted with an appropriate coating material to form a mixture, before substantial particulate magnetic substrate aggregation occurs, and the mixture is subjected to appropriate heating for a time sufficient for the coating material to adhere to the substrate particles, thereby yielding the desired resuspendable, coated magnetic particles."

  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/070613 filed Dec. 22, 2010, claiming priority based on Spanish Patent Application No. 200902399, filed Dec. 29, 2009, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the use of a series of sulphated disaccharides for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a neurodegenerative and/or neurovascular disease, as well as for the treatment of a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. The present invention also relates to the use of said sulphated disaccharides for the preparation of a neuroprotective medicament. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Neurodegenerative diseases, neurovascular diseases and traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries are one of the most important causes of disability and death in the population. Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke stand out among these diseases. These diseases are generally characterized by a loss of neurons, which translates into the onset of language and memory disorders in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, movement coordination disorders in Parkinson&#39;s disease, paralysis of the voluntary muscles involved in motility, speech and respiration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hemiplegias and sensory losses in stroke and paralysis in traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. Oxidative cell stress is involved in various neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases. The central nervous system, and specifically the brain, has a high oxygen requirement. Oxygen consumption leads to the overproduction of so-called reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide or hydroxyl type free radicals or non-radical oxygen such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which cause damage both in neuronal and in vascular cells ( Oxidative neurotoxicity in rat cerebral cortex neurons: synergistic effects of H 2 O 2 and NO on apoptosis involving activation of p 38 mitogen - activated protein kinase and caspase -3, J. Y. Wang et al., J. Neurosci. Res. 72, 508-519 (2003)). To control the levels of these oxidant compounds, cells have antioxidant systems, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, transferrin or vitamin E. Under normal physiological conditions there is an equilibrium between these antioxidant systems and reactive oxygen species. However, problems may arise when said equilibrium is altered due to a decrease of the antioxidant defenses and/or to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Under those conditions, oxidative stress can cause cell damage and subsequent cell death, neurons being particularly vulnerable cells. It is known that oxidative stress is one of the main cell death mechanisms in different cytotoxic models, such as that of glutamate ( Glutamate induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in cerebral vascular endothelial cells: contributions of HO -1 and HO -2 to cytoprotection , H. Parfenova et al., Am. J. Physiol. 290: C1399-C1410 (2006)) or in the H 2 O 2 -induced cytotoxicity model ( Distinct protective mechanisms of HO -1 and HO -2 against hydroperoxide - induced cytotoxicity , Y. S. Kim et al., Free Radic. Biol. Med. 38, 85-92 (2005)) and in neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke and arteriosclerosis ( Oxidative stress in brain aging, neurodegenerative and vascular diseases: an overview , E. Mariani et al., J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 827, 65-75 (2005); Oxidative stress and neuronal death/survival signaling in cerebral ischemia , A. Saito et al., Mol. Neurobiol. 31, 105-116 (2005); Oxidative stress in the context of acute cerebrovascular stroke , M. M. H. El Kossi et al., Stroke 31, 1889-1892 (2000); The oxidant stress hypothesis of atherogenesis , L. Iuliano, Lipids 36, suppl: S41-44 (2001)). The compounds of the present invention are disaccharides containing one or more sulphate groups in their structure, first described in patent EP 1300411 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,304). They are useful in the treatment of arthrosis (patent EP 1300411) and in the treatment of tendon, ligament and bone diseases (patent application WO 2008/151898). The basic structure of these compounds contains the monosaccharides glucuronic acid and glucosamine, bonded by means of \u03b2-(1\u21923) bonds, and with a sulphate group in C-4 and/or in C-6 of the monosaccharide glucosamine. In view of the above, it is of great interest to find drugs capable of protecting neurons under oxidative stress conditions and of reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species. Said drugs could be highly useful as therapeutic tools for the treatment of neurodegenerative and/or neurovascular diseases, as well as for the treatment of traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries. The use of the sulphated disaccharides of the present invention in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease and/or of a neurovascular disease as well as in the treatment of a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury has not been described up until now. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have surprisingly found that the compounds described in patent EP 1300411, defined by formula (I), reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species and have neuroprotective activity, protecting against cell death induced by oxidative stress, or by oxygen and glucose deprivation.

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention pertains generally to cup lids and more particularly to a celebratory glass top and a method of use thereof. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0002] Individuals often like to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, or other events. Often, to celebrate these events or milestones, individuals may hold a party or go out to eat at a restaurant. As part of this celebration deserts are eaten, such as cakes or cupcakes.

The lid 100 may have multiple tiers 110 , 120 , 130 formed by concentrically smaller circles stacked together. In the preferred embodiment the lid 100 has a first tier 110 , a second tier 120 , and a third tier 130. In other embodiments the lid 100 may have only one tier. In other embodiments the lid 100 may have any number of tiers. The lid 100 has a bottom rim 140 which engages the top rim of the glass. The rim 140 may simply engage the top rim of the glass. In other embodiments the rim 140 forms a tight fit on the rim of the glass so that the lid 100 is removably secured to the glass. The lid 100 also has a plurality of vent holes 150. The vent holes 150 may be on each tier or only one tier. The vent holes permit air to pass through from the inner cavity formed by the lid 100 to outside of the lid 100. The vent holes 150 permit carbonation from the beverage in the glass to vent through the vent holes 150. If the beverage in the glass is beer then the vent holes 150 encourage the formation of a head on the top of the beer. In some embodiments only a number of the circular portions are vent holes 150 and other circular portions may resemble vent holes but be either depressions or indentations of the material of the lid 100. In the center of the third tier 130 is a circular projection 160. In the middle of the circular projection 160 is a circular cavity 162. The circular projection 160 may be any shape and size. The circular projection 160 may be rounded or may be a thin straight circular projection. The circular cavity 162 is a cavity extending into the central inner cavity of the lid 100. The circular cavity 162 is configured to receive and hold a candle. The lid 100 may have one or more circular projections 160 and one or more circular cavities 162. Each circular projection 160 may have a circular cavity 162 or may not have a circular cavity 162. Each circular cavity 162 may have a circular projection 160 or may not have a circular projection 160. [0019] On the outer circumference of third tier 130 is an outer lip 180. The outer lip 180 in conjunction with the circular projection 160 can be used to hold a cupcake onto the top of the lid 100. The lid 100 may have a top printed message 170. The top printed message 170 may be any message such as \u201cHappy Birthday!!\u201d or \u201cCongratulations!\u201d The top printed message 170 may be a message printed onto the lid 100 with ink or may be preformed into the third tier 130. In addition, the lid 100 may have a side printed message 190. The side printed message 190 may be any message such as \u201cHappy Birthday!!\u201d or \u201cCongratulations!\u201d In other embodiments the side printed message is a word advertisement, logo, slogan, or other advertising message. In other embodiments the side printed message may be any word, image, picture, or design printed on, embedded into, or preformed into the side of the tier. The side printed message 190 may be a message printed onto the outer circumference of any tier or preformed into the side of any tier. [0020] As shown in FIG. 2 , in the preferred embodiment of the invention the lid 100 has a circular body that is coextensive with the circular rim of a glass. In addition, in the preferred embodiment, the first tier 110 , second tier 120 , and third tier 130 are circular. However, in other embodiments the body and the tiers may be shaped differently. For instance the first tier 110 , second tier 120 , and third tier 130 may all be square in shape to fit a glass with a square shaped rim. In addition, the first tier 110 , second tier 120 , and third tier 130 may all present a triangular, rectangular, oval, hexagonal, heptagonal, or octogonal profile shape when viewed from the top. The profile shape of the lid 100 and the tiers may be any shape when viewed from the top, formed by any number of curved lines, straight lines, or combination thereof. In another embodiment the first tier 110 may have a different profile shape than the second tier 120 , which in turn may have a different profile shape than the third tier 130. [0021] Referring to FIG. 3 , a cross sectional view of the lid 100 is displayed. The circular cavity 162 extends into the internal cavity defined by the body of the lid 100. The circular cavity 162 is defined by a cavity wall 164. The cavity wall 164 may be any size, shape, and dimension. The cavity wall 164 prevents a candle placed in the circular cavity 162 from falling through into the internal cavity defined by the body of the lid 100. [0022] Referring to FIG. 4 , the use of the lid 100 is illustrated. First a user fills a glass 200 with a desired beverage. The user then places the lid 100 on the top of the glass 200. A user places a candle 300 in the circular cavity 162 of the lid 100. The user then lights the candle 300 and presents it to an individual. The individual then can blow out the candle 300 , remove the lid 100 , and drink the beverage. [0023] Referring to FIG. 5 , another method of utilizing the lid 100 is illustrated. In this method, a user fills a glass 200 with a desired beverage. The user then places the lid 100 on top of the glass 200. The user then places a cupcake 400 on top of the lid 100. The cupcake 400 is removably secured to the lid 100 by inserting the circular protrusion 100 into the body of the cupcake 400. The bottom of the cupcake 400 is placed against the top surface of the lid 100. In addition, the outer lip 180 extends upward around the outer circumference of the cupcake 400 to prevent the cupcake 400 from sliding off of the lid 100. The user can then place a candle 300 into the top surface of the cupcake 400. The user then lights the candle 300. The user then presents the glass 200 with the lid 100 to an individual. The individual then can blow out the candle 300 , remove the candle 300 from the cupcake 400 , remove the cupcake 400 from the lid 100 , eat the cupcake 400 , remove the lid 100 from the glass 200 , and drink the beverage. [0024] Referring to FIG. 6 , an alternative embodiment of the lid 100 is displayed. In this embodiment, each tier is a separate piece that snaps together with the neighboring tier. This permits each tier to be a different color and a user may mix and match the colors of the tiers as chosen. In this embodiment the first tier 110 is separate from the second tier 120 , which in turn is separate from the third tier 130. The first tier 110 has a first tier central opening 112 in the top surface of the first tier 110. Surrounding the periphery of the first tier central opening 112 are a plurality of first tier receptors 114. The second tier 120 has a second tier central opening 122. Surrounding the second tier central opening 122 are a plurality of second tier receptors 124. Along the bottom edge of the second tier 120 are a plurality of second tier securing projections 126. The second tier securing projections 126 are disposed to enter into the first tier receptors 114. The first tier receptors 114 receive and secure the second tier securing projections 126 , removably securing the second tier 120 to the first tier 110. The third tier 130 has a plurality of third tier securing projections 134 along the lower edge of the third tier 130. The third tier securing projections 134 are disposed to enter into the second tier receptors 124. The second tier receptors 124 receive and secure the third tier securing projections 134 , removably securing the third tier 130 to the second tier 120. In some embodiments the first tier 110 and second tier 120 do not have a first tier central opening 112 and a second tier central opening 122 but instead have continuous flat surfaces. In the preferred embodiment, the securing projections and receptors are configured to snap together. In other embodiments, the first tier 110 , the second tier 120 , and the third tier 130 each can be removably secured to the other tiers. In the preferred embodiment the means for securing the tiers together are the securing projections and receptors. In other embodiments, any means can be used to removably secure the tiers together. In one embodiment the tiers may be held together using hook and loop tape, adhesive, tape, or any other structural components on the tiers which may be secured together with complementary structural components on the neighboring tiers. [0025] The lid 100 may be made from any type of commercially available material. In the preferred embodiment the lid 100 is made of a formed thermoplastic such as polystyrene or polypropylene. Alternatively, the lid 100 may be made from sugar so that the lid 100 is edible. In other embodiments the lid 100 is constructed from paper. [0026] What has been described above includes examples of the claimed subject matter. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the claimed subject matter, but one of ordinary skill in the art can recognize that many further combinations and permutations of such matter are possible. Accordingly, the claimed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is used in either the detailed description or the claims, such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as \u201ccomprising\u201d is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.

  "query": "What technology assists in measuring and indicating probe rotation to prevent catheter entanglement during medical procedures?,",
  "negative": "FIELD OF INTEREST The disclosed innovations focus on advanced remote manipulation techniques for elongated instruments in medical interventions, particularly addressing complications in handling and orientating such devices. BACKGROUND It is often necessary for a clinician to guide a flexible device such as a catheter within a patient, but tracking its orientation and preventing it from knotting or twisting can be challenging. There have been several strategies suggested to mitigate such occurrences. For instance, a catheter detailed in a particular document includes embedded visual aids along its length, facilitating direct observational tracking by the clinician as it progresses through a body cavity. Other documents have presented the integration of a flexible sleeve encompassing a signal-transmitting wire that enhances twist-resistance. OUTLINE OF THE INNOVATION An aspect of the disclosed innovations is to provide a technique, which involves: as an operator maneuvers a long instrument having leading and trailing ends within a patient, gauging a resultant orientation shift imparted on the trailing end by the operator; and then rendering a notification based on the orientation shift to the operator. Various embodiments may involve detection of orientation shift through a sensor affixed to the instrument. For instance, one can utilize a geomagnetic orientation sensor, and base the orientation shift measure on the detection of outside magnetic influences through this sensor. Alternatively, a version includes a kinetic movement sensor, wherein gauging the orientation shift involves interpreting rotational kinetic movements relative to the main axis of the instrument using this sensor. The sensor may be positioned on either extremity of the instrument. Furthermore, relaying the notification can encompass warning the operator if the orientation shift surpasses a preset limit, suggesting an optimal rotation direction to normalize the orientation shift, or simply numeric depiction of the orientation shift. An embodiment can also encompass an apparatus, such as: a processor linked to alongside a probe, featuring leading and trailing ends, and tasked with computing orientation shifts imparted on the tail end by an operator, while the operator maneuvers the tail end to relocate the lead end within a patient; along with an output interface, devised to relay an indicator of the orientation shift to the operator. Exploratory medical devices and assorted probes fall within the scope of the disclosed innovations, thus expanding their application beyond solely cardiological catheters. In essence, we strive for sophisticated but practical solutions to mitigate common issues with instrument maneuverability and safety during invasive medical procedures.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/851,085, filed Aug. 5, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,307,927, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to medical probes, and particularly to methods and systems for sensing and indicating probe rotation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When a physician manipulates a catheter during a medical procedure, the catheter may become twisted or tangled. Several methods and systems have been proposed in order to detect or avoid such situations. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,978, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a catheter that includes fluoroscopic marker components disposed in the catheter distal end, in order to provide enhanced fluoroscopic visibility. Some of the disclosed catheter configurations are used for providing visual information to the physician regarding the direction and degree of twist of the catheter distal end. U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,197, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a turn limiter for a catheter with a twistable tip. The catheter has a flexible wall for use in complex twisting anatomy, and contains a torque wire or a torquable guide wire lumen. The torque wire or torquable guide wire lumen extends through the length of the catheter and is attached to the catheter at or near the distal end thereof. The proximal end of the torque wire protrudes from the proximal end of the catheter and is attached to a turn limiter. The turn limiter allows limited rotation of the proximal end of the torque wire or torquable guide wire lumen without axial dislocation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An embodiment of the present invention that is described herein provides a method, including: while an operator of an elongated probe, having proximal and distal ends, manipulates the proximal end so as to move the distal end within a body of a patient, automatically measuring a cumulative angle of rotation that is applied by the operator to the proximal end; and presenting an indication of the cumulative angle of rotation to the operator. In some embodiments, measuring the cumulative angle of rotation includes sensing the cumulative angle of rotation using a sensor that is coupled to the probe. In an embodiment, the sensor includes a magnetic position sensor, and measuring the cumulative angle of rotation includes sensing one or more externally-applied magnetic fields using the magnetic position sensor and estimating the cumulative angle of rotation responsively to the sensed magnetic fields. In a disclosed embodiment, the sensor includes an acceleration sensor, and measuring the cumulative angle of rotation includes sensing an angular acceleration with respect to a longitudinal axis of the probe using the acceleration sensor and estimating the cumulative angle of rotation responsively to the sensed angular acceleration. In some embodiments, the sensor is coupled to the proximal end of the probe. In alternative embodiments, the sensor is coupled to the distal end of the probe. In an embodiment, presenting the indication includes alerting the operator when the cumulative angle of rotation exceeds a predefined threshold. Additionally or alternatively, presenting the indication includes indicating to the operator a preferred rotation direction that would reduce the cumulative angle of rotation. Further additionally or alternatively, presenting the indication includes displaying the cumulative angle of rotation alphanumerically to the operator. There is additionally provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, apparatus, including: a processor, which is connected to an elongated probe having proximal and distal ends, and which is configured to measure a cumulative angle of rotation that is applied by an operator to the proximal end of the probe while the operator manipulates the proximal end so as to move the distal end within a body of a patient; and an output device, which is configured to present an indication of the cumulative angle of rotation to the operator. There is also provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a computer software product operating in conjunction with an elongated probe having proximal and distal ends, the product including a computer-readable medium, in which program instructions are stored, which instructions, when read by a computer, cause the computer to measure a cumulative angle of rotation that is applied by an operator to the proximal end of the probe while the operator manipulates the proximal end so as to move the distal end within a body of a patient, and to present an indication of the cumulative angle of rotation to the operator. There is further provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, apparatus, including: a probe, including: an elongated body having distal and proximal end; and a sensor, which is coupled to the body and is configured to generate signals that are indicative of a rotation applied to the proximal end by an operator; and a processor, which is configured to estimate a cumulative angle of rotation responsively to the signals, and to present an indication of the cumulative angle of rotation to the operator. The present invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of the embodiments thereof, taken together with the drawings in which: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1 and 2 are schematic, pictorial illustrations of a system for magnetic position tracking that uses a cardiac catheter, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 3 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for preventing catheter entanglement, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Overview In some medical procedures, a physician navigates the distal end of a catheter in a patient&#39;s body. The physician moves the distal end by manipulating the proximal end of the catheter, e.g., using a handle fitted at the proximal end. In particular, the physician sometimes rotates the catheter about the catheter&#39;s longitudinal axis, for example in order to adjust the viewing angle or bending direction of the catheter tip, or to navigate along certain paths. In most cases, either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation could be used to achieve the same result. In practice, however, a given physician tends to repeatedly rotate the catheter in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). Excessive rotation in the same direction may cause the catheter body and/or interconnection cables to twist and entangle. This sort of twisting and entanglement may cause difficulty in maneuvering the catheter, and in some cases damage the catheter. In some cases the catheter cable has to be disconnected in order to untwist it. Embodiments of the present invention that are described hereinbelow provide methods and systems for preventing excessive catheter rotation. The disclosed techniques automatically measure the cumulative rotation angle applied to the catheter&#39;s proximal end, and present an indication of the cumulative rotation angle to the physician. In an example embodiment, the cumulative rotation angle is measured using a magnetic position sensor that is fitted in the distal end of the catheter. In an alternative embodiment, the cumulative rotation angle is measured using a magnetic position sensor or an acceleration sensor that is fitted in the proximal end of the catheter, e.g., in the catheter handle. Various indications can be presented to the physician based on the measured cumulative rotation angle. In one embodiment, the numerical value of the rotation angle is displayed to the physician on a monitor screen. In another embodiment, the physician is alerted when the cumulative rotation angle exceeds a maximum allowed value. In some embodiments, the physician is given an indication as to the preferred direction for subsequent rotation of the catheter (the direction that would reduce the cumulative rotation angle). When using the disclosed techniques, catheter twisting and entanglement are reduced. As a result, catheter damage is avoided, and the physician can maneuver the catheter without interference. Although the embodiments described herein refer mainly to cardiac catheters, the disclosed techniques can be used with various other types of medical probes, such as endoscopes. System Description FIG. 1 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a system 20 for magnetic position tracking that uses a cardiac catheter, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 20 may be based, for example, on the CARTO\u2122 system, produced by Biosense-Webster Inc. (Diamond Bar, Calif.). In system 20 , a physician 24 (or other operator) inserts a catheter 28 (or other probe) into the body of a patient 30. Catheter 28 has a proximal end that is handled by the physician, and a distal end 36 that is navigated through the patient body. Catheter 28 is connected to a control console 44 using a cable 32. In the embodiment described herein, catheter 28 is inserted into the patient&#39;s heart and used in creating electrophysiological maps of one or more heart chambers. Alternatively, catheter 28 may be used, mutatis mutandis, for other therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes in the heart or in other body organs. Console 44 uses magnetic position sensing to determine position coordinates of distal end 36 inside the heart. To determine the position coordinates, a driver circuit in console 44 drives field generators 40 to generate magnetic fields within the body of patient 30. Typically, field generators 40 comprise coils, which are placed at known positions below the patient&#39;s torso. A magnetic position sensor within distal end 36 of catheter 28 (shown in detail in FIG. 2 below) generates electrical signals in response to these magnetic fields. A processor 48 in console 44 processes these signals in order to determine the position coordinates of distal end 36 , typically including both location and orientation coordinates. Magnetic position tracking methods of this sort are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,391,199, 6,690,963, 6,484,118, 6,239,724, 6,618,612 and 6,332,089, in PCT International Publication WO 96/05768, and in U.S. Patent Application Publications 2002/0065455, 2003/0120150 and 2004/0068178, whose disclosures are all incorporated herein by reference. Based on the signals received from catheter 28 , processor 44 drives a display 52 to present physician 24 with a map of cardiac electrophysiological activity, as well as providing visual feedback regarding the position of distal end 36 in the patient&#39;s body and status information and guidance regarding the procedure that is in progress. Processor 48 typically comprises a general-purpose computer, with suitable front end and interface circuits for receiving signals from catheter 28 and controlling the other components of console 44. Processor 48 may be programmed in software to carry out the functions that are described herein. The software may be downloaded to processor 48 in electronic form, over a network, for example, or it may be provided on non-transitory tangible media, such as optical, magnetic or electronic memory media. Alternatively, some or all of the functions of processor 48 may be carried out by dedicated or programmable digital hardware components. Detection and Prevention of Catheter Twisting and Entanglement When conducting the medical procedure, physician 24 sometimes rotates catheter 28 about its longitudinal axis, for example in order to adjust the viewing angle or bending direction of the catheter tip, or to navigate along certain paths in the heart or vascular system. In most cases, either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation can be applied to achieve the same result. In practice, however, the physician tends to repeatedly rotate the catheter in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), e.g., because of habit or convenience. Excessive rotation of catheter 28 in the same direction may cause catheter 28 and/or cable 32 to twist and entangle. This sort of twisting and entanglement may cause difficulty in maneuvering the catheter, and in some cases damage the catheter or cable. In some embodiments of the present invention, system 20 comprises means for detecting over-rotation of catheter 28 in a certain direction, and for notifying physician 24 of the detected over-rotation. In some embodiments, processor 48 measures the cumulative rotation angle that is applied to the catheter by the physician, and presents an indication of the measured cumulative rotation angle to the physician. Using this indication, the physician can be alerted when the catheter is over-rotated, and can perform subsequent rotations in the opposite direction. The term \u201ccumulative rotation angle\u201d refers to the total net rotation applied in a given (e.g., clockwise) direction about the catheter&#39;s longitudinal axis. For example, two complete clockwise turns are regarded as a cumulative rotation angle of +720\u00b0. Two complete counterclockwise turns are regarded as a cumulative rotation angle of \u2212720\u00b0. Applying a complete clockwise turn followed by a 45\u00b0 counterclockwise rotation produces a cumulative rotation angle of +315\u00b0. The choice of representing clockwise rotations using positive angles and counterclockwise rotations using negative angles is arbitrary, and the opposite convention can also be used. FIG. 2 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of certain elements of system 20 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 shows catheter 28 and some of console 44 in greater detail. In the present embodiment, a handle 56 is fitted at the proximal end of catheter 28. The handle is used for maneuvering the catheter by the physician, and in particular for rotating the catheter about its axis. A connector 62 connects catheter 28 to cable 32. A magnetic position sensor 66 is fitted in distal end 36 of catheter 28 , in order to carry out magnetic position tracking of the distal end by system 20 , as explained above. In some embodiments, a sensor 64 , e.g., a magnetic position sensor or an acceleration sensor, is coupled to the proximal end of the catheter, for example fitted in handle 56 or connector 62. In some embodiments, processor 48 measures the cumulative rotation angle that the physician applies to catheter 28. In an example embodiment, processor 48 measures the cumulative rotation angle based on the signals produced by magnetic position sensor 66 in the distal end. In a typical application of this sort, system 20 measures the location and orientation coordinates of distal end 36 using the magnetic position tracking methods described above. In particular, processor 48 tracks the orientation of the distal end based on the signals produced by sensor 66 , and calculates the cumulative rotation angle of the catheter. In an alternative embodiment, processor 48 receives signals from sensor 64 in the proximal end of the catheter, and estimates the cumulative rotation angle based on these signals. In an example embodiment, sensor 64 comprises an acceleration sensor. In this embodiment, the signals are indicative of the angular acceleration of the catheter (in the present example of handle 56 ) about its longitudinal axis. Processor 48 processes these signals so as to estimate the cumulative rotation angle applied to the catheter. In an example embodiment, the processor integrates the measured angular acceleration to estimate the angular velocity of the catheter, and integrates the angular velocity to estimate the cumulative angle or rotation. In an alternative embodiment, sensor 64 comprises a magnetic position sensor, e.g., a sensor similar to sensor 66. In this embodiment, system 20 measures and tracks the position of sensor 64 similarly to the tracking of sensor 66. Using the signals produced by sensor 64 , processor 48 estimates the cumulative rotation angle applied to the catheter. In alternative embodiments, processor 48 may calculate the cumulative rotation angle based on inputs from two or more sensors, e.g., based on both sensor 66 at the distal end and sensor 64 at the proximal end. Further alternatively, processor 48 may measure or estimate the cumulative rotation angle applied to catheter 28 based on any other suitable sensor and using any other suitable method. Note that the disclosed techniques are in no way limited to use in magnetic position tracking systems such as system 20. For example, the methods described herein can be used with an acceleration sensor at the proximal end, without a position tracking system of any kind. Typically, the signals produced by the sensor or sensors in the catheter produce signals that are indicative of the absolute rotation angle of the catheter, and not of the cumulative rotation angle. Computation of the cumulative rotation angle based on these signals is performed by processor 48. In some embodiments, processor 48 presents an indication of the measured cumulative rotation angle to physician 24. In the example embodiment of FIG. 2 , processor 48 displays an alphanumeric field 67 showing the present value of the cumulative rotation angle on display 52. Alternatively, processor 48 may display the present value of the cumulative rotation angle using any other suitable alphanumeric or graphical method. In some embodiments, processor 48 alerts the physician when the cumulative rotation angle exceeds a predefined (positive or negative) threshold. This sort of alert enables the physician to start rotating the catheter in the opposite direction or otherwise avoid over-rotation of the catheter. Processor 48 may alert the physician using any suitable method, e.g., by displaying a certain message or icon on display 52 or by sounding an audible alert. In some embodiments, processor 48 notifies the physician of a preferable rotation direction for future rotations. In other words, the processor notifies the physician of the rotation direction that would reduce the cumulative rotation angle. Thus, if the present cumulative rotation angle is positive (clockwise), processor 48 may recommend to the physician to perform subsequent rotations in a counterclockwise manner, and vice versa. In the example of FIG. 2 , processor 48 displays an arrow 68 , which indicates the recommended rotation direction to the physician. Alternatively, any other suitable indication method can also be used. FIG. 3 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for preventing catheter entanglement, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method begins with physician 24 maneuvering catheter 28 in the body of patient 30 as part of a medical procedure, at a catheter manipulation step 70. In particular, the physician applies rotation to the catheter. Processor 48 measures the cumulative rotation angle applied to the catheter during the procedure, at an angle measurement step 74."

  "negative": "A planting apparatus is introduced for the efficient transfer of grains from a storage unit to individual planting receptacles, incorporating a base structure situated upon support elements. This structure hosts a granule reservoir with a level bottom, adjacent to a manifold that aids in the grain transfer process. Additionally, a hand-controlled grain retrieval head, mounted on rollers for linear movement, is positioned over these components. A negative pressure source attaches to the retrieval head, pulling grains through a sequence of openings distributed across the head's leading edge. These portals are tinier than the grains to ensure their retention, and their clear visibility to the operator guarantees optimal function. A flexible conduit serves as the vacuum line. A switch within the retrieval head allows the operator to create either a vacuum, a discharge, or a neutral atmosphere at the portals. In case grains adhere to the head when the vacuum is cut off, a flow of compressed air is introduced to unsettle them. The grains, once detached, descend into the planting receptacles, aided by gravity and the air flow. The apparatus promises improved performance over existing technology by wholly eliminating issues like grains sticking to the head and enabling the device to work effectively even with reduced grain levels in the supply unit.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application, Ser. No. 573,412, filed May 1, 1975, entitled &#34;Seed Planter&#34;, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,638, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to automatic and semi-automatic seeders. More specifically, the invention relates to a seeder for use in the bedding plant industry which will reliably pick up seeds from a seed tray and deposit them in a predetermined array into a flat or into peat cups. The problem of getting millions of seedlings planted in a short period of time has forced the horticultural nursery industry into mechanizing this operation. Horticulturists have recognized that direct seeding by machine can greatly cut labor costs in the initial planting of the seeds. By initially planting the seeds in individual peat cups, the step of transplanting the plants from flats to peat cups is eliminated. Thus, there is no setback in growth due to transplanting, and the plants are not contaminated by the handling associated with transplanting. U.S. Pat. No. 2,546,838 to Carl H. Tasche describes a seeder with a suction header which has a coordinate array of downwardly projecting suction tubes. Upon producing a suction in the header, the tubes pick up seeds from a seed tray. The header is then slidably moved on a horizontal track to a position over a flat where the suction is cut off and the tubes deposit the seeds in a coordinate array. U.S. Pat. No. 2,445,701 describes a seed counting machine using a similar principle. Jiffy Products of America of West Chicago, Illinois, sells a Fricke-Jiffy Seeder which is designed to pick up and distribute through an arrangement of tubes of maximum of 96 seeds into a large flat. The Fricke-Jiffy Seeder is described in an article in the September 1970 issue of Grower Talks magazine published by Geo. J. Ball, Inc., of West Chicago, Illinois 60185. The previously described prior art devices incorporate hollow suction tubes which point downward and are mechanically lowered into the seed tray to pick up seeds. It has been found that in normal operation, a certain percentage, around 10 percent, of the tubes will not pick up a seed in a given cycle. The operator has no way to visually inspect the ends of the tubes to determine whether each tube has picked up a seed. Furthermore, when the seed tray empties to less than one-half full, the seeds in the tray tend to pack into a hard layer and thus become much harder to pick up. Periodic refilling and stirring of the seeds is necessary to alleviate this problem. This packing phenomenon occurs most noticeably with &#34;fuzzy&#34; tomato seeds. Thus, in this era of increasing labor cost, there is an acute need for an improved semi-automatic seeder for the small to medium sized nursery which allows essentially 100 percent pick up of seeds and which allows the operator to view each suction hole to assure that a seed has been picked up by each hole. Also, the seeder should be operable with a low level of seeds in the seed tray to prevent the unnecessary waste of unused seeds. The prior art practice was improved upon and the previously mentioned objectives were accomplished by the subject matter of copending application, Ser. No. 573,412, which provides a seeding apparatus for transferring seeds from a seed supply to a flat or individual peat cups. This seeding apparatus incorporates a hand-manipulated seed pick-up head and a seed tray which holds the supply of seeds to be planted. The seed tray has a substantially flat bottom and interconnecting sides and is adapted to hold a predetermined supply of seeds. A vacuum source is connected to the pick-up head for providing a suction force through a horizontal line of equally-spaced apertures on the frontal face of the pick-up head. The apertures are smaller than the seeds so that the seeds are held in place over the apertures. These apertures are readily visible by the operator at all times so that he may check on the efficiency of operation, i.e., he can see which apertures have seeds and which do not. A manifold positioned adjacent to the seed tray of this apparatus provides a plurality of horizontally aligned and spaced openings along an upper surface. These openings are positioned and spaced so as to mate with the apertures on the face of the head so as to receive the seeds when released. An array of plastic tubes communicate with the openings and extend downwardly to deposit the seeds. A disadvantage of this apparatus is that the seeds sometimes stick to the frontal face of the pickup head when the vacuum is released. In this regard, it becomes an object of the present invention to provide means for assuring that all of the seeds secured to the frontal face are released when desired. Other objects, including a simpler means for positioning the tubes over the peat cups, will become apparent from the specification. Also, an improved valve is provided. While applicant&#39;s copending application apparatus provides a much needed and greatly improved seeding apparatus, it becomes an object of the present invention to improve upon such apparatus while maintaining its many advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A seeding apparatus for transferring seeds from a seed supply to a flat or individual peat cups incorporates a support frame mounted on legs which are adapted to reside upon a worktable or other suitable surface. The frame mounts a seed tray having a substantially flat base and a manifold utilized in transferring the seeds. The frame also mounts a hand-manipulated seed pick-up head which is placed on rollers for rectilinear movement and which has a limited vertical range of motion for moving from the seed tray to the manifold levels. A vacuum source is connected to the pick-up head for providing a suction force through a line of equally-spaced apertures on a frontal face of the pick-up head. Each aperture is centered on a convex raised area on the frontal face surface. The apertures are smaller than the seeds so that the seeds are held in place on the convex surface over the apertures. The convex surface aids in making the seed covered apertures visible to the operator at all times and aids in preventing the seeds from sticking to apertures. A flexible hose is used as the vacuum line. A second line is connected to the pick-up head for providing a flow of pressurized air to the apertures when it is desired to release the seeds from the apertures. A novel valve arrangement within the pick-up head allows for positive, negative or neutral pressure conditions at the apertures. The valve includes a resilient ball member attached to a valve stem and which may be moved from a normally open position to a seated or closed position. When in the closed position, a number of openings connected to the exhaust port of the vacuum are uncovered so that a positive pressure may be applied to the seed pick-up apertures. A manifold positioned adjacent to the seed tray has a plurality of horizontally aligned and spaced openings along an upper surface which mate with the apertures on the face of the pick-up head so as to receive the seeds when released. An array of plastic tubes communicate with the openings and extend from beneath the manifold with the lower ends of the tubes being received by adjustable guides positioned above the peat cups. Once the vacuum is applied to the pick-up head, the head is lowered by the operator and is manually rolled along the provided track so that the pick-up head is drawn through the seed supply tray and each aperture picks up a desired number of seeds, all of which are in the view of the operator. After picking up the seeds, the head is manually rolled along the track in a slightly raised position to a point where the head is positioned on the manifold so that the apertures align with the openings in the manifold. Upon cutoff of the vacuum supply the seeds are free to drop from the face of the seed pick-up head so as to fall by gravity through the manifold openings and tubes and into the peat cups. Should the seed fail to drop when the vacuum is released, a pressurized air supply line may be used to supply a puff of air to the apertures thereby forcing the seeds free. The process is then repeated by manually rolling the raised pick-up head back to a position over the supply tray and repeating the operation. The seeds in the supply tray are always maintained loose due to the back and forth motion applied to the seed pick-up head by the operator. The operator can assure an efficient operation since he always has view of the apertures in the pick-up head face. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of the seed planter of the present invention with the pick-up head in a raised position prior to it being moved forward into the seed supply tray. FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of the seed planter shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is an enlarged front elevation view of the pick-up head employed in the present invention. FIG. 4 is a section view taken substantially along line 4--4 of FIG. 3 disclosing the internal features of the valve with the open position shown in solid lines and the closed position in dashed lines. FIG. 5 is a section view taken along line 5--5 of FIG. 1 illustrating the adjustable tube positioning feature of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, the seed planter 10 of the present invention comprises an upper support frame having top members 11 and vertical support members 12 and a bottom support frame which includes sides 13, front wall 14 and back wall 16. Support members 12 are made integral with sidewalls 13. Four adjustable legs 17 are secured to front and back walls 14, 16 for supporting the planter on a table top, or the like. A seed supply tray 19 and two manifold blocks 20 are mounted in a fixed position on top members 11 by bolts or any other suitable means. Seed tray 19 has a substantially flat bottom and interconnecting sides. Each manifold 20 has a flat top wall surface and an upright wall extending from the flat surface and formed with a plurality of curved recessed cavities. A plurality of holes aligned with the cavities extend downwardly through each manifold 20. These cavities and holes are positioned, as seen from later description, to align with the apertures on the pick-up head from which the seeds are deposited. A detailed description of a form of manifold construction is found in copending application Ser. No. 573,412 and will not be repeated since it suits the invention. A pick-up head carriage 23 is mounted on top members 11 by means of four rollers 28 which move between track or rail members 25. Carriage 23 includes a pair of angle members 27 on which the rollers 28 are mounted. A pair of vertical support members 29 extend from angle members 27 and each is pivotally secured to an arm member 30 by a pivot pin 31. Arm members 30 are also pivotally secured to a pair of support brackets 36 by pivot pins 35. Support brackets 36 are, in turn, fixedly secured to the pick-up head by welds or the like at 37 (see FIGS. 2 and 3). A pair of springs 34 provide an upward bias on arms 30. Thus, pick-up head 24 may be vertically moved about fixed pivot pins 31 during operation. A pair of stop bosses 33 provide an upper limitation on the movement of pick-up head 24 and a lower limitation on such movement is provided by the base of the seed tray 19. Referring to FIG. 3, seed pick-up head 24 includes tubular members 40 which provide an air passage. The seed receiving member 41 is made from tubing similar to members 40 but with its face area 42 providing a flattened surface which includes a plurality of equally-spaced apertures 43. Apertures 43 are centered on convex raised surfaces 44 which form a part of face area 42. As previously stated, apertures 43 align with the holes in manifold 20. In the illustrated embodiment, head 24 includes 24 apertures 43 which align with 24 cavities in each of the two manifolds 20. Thus, by depositing 24 seeds in the first manifold and then picking up 24 more seeds and depositing them in the second manifold, the operator may fill 48 peat cups (corresponding to four rows with 12 in each row as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2). By providing additional manifolds, the number of peat cups filled may be increased to 72, 96 or any multiple of 24. Of course, a pick-up head having more or less than 24 aligned pick-up apertures may be utilized provided the manifolds have an equal number of spaced openings for receiving the seed. An electric vacuum pump 70 is situated at the rear of the support frame and is held in place by upright member 71. Vacuum pump 70 connects to a flexible, extendible vacuum hose 65 which in turn connects to seed pick-up head 24 through a valve assembly 50. Hose 65 is supported by a hose support bracket 72 which is integrally secured to upright 26. A second flexible, extendible line 74 passes from the exhaust or pressure side of pump 70 and enters a heat exchange chamber 75 positioned immediately below seed tray 19. The exhaust from pump 70 is somewhat warmer than ambient so that a warm base surface is maintained in tray 19 when pump 70 is in operation. It has been found that the heat helps to prevent the seeds from packing and sticking together. The heated air forced through heat exchange chamber 75 is allowed to exit through a pipe 77 which emerges from the side of chamber 75. A pressurized air supply line 59 has one end terminating within pipe 77 and, as explained below, has the other end terminating within valve 50. During operation, the exhaust within pipe 77 simply flows past line 59 and exhausts to the air. However, once valve 50 is moved to its closed position, the operator can place the palm of his hand momentarily over the opening to pipe 77 and pressurized air will be forced through line 59 into valve 50, through pick-up head 24 and out apertures 43. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, valve assembly 50 includes a pair of hollow members 51, 52 with member 52 being of slightly larger diameter and capable of receiving member 51 and the two being held together by a screw 53. A T-connection 54 is integrally secured by welding to members 51 and 40, and provides an air passage from valve 50 to members 40. A boss 55 integral with T-connection 54 mounts a spring 56 which biases the valve stem 57 outwardly to the open position shown in solid lines in FIG. 4. Stem 57 has at its lower end a finger engagable plunger member 58 and at its upper end a resilient ball member 63. Ball 63 is held on stem 57 by nut 64 and is of a diameter large enough so that when stem 57 is moved inward against the bias of spring 56, ball 63 will close off the communication with vacuum base 65 by seating in the constricted upper portion of member 52 (see the dashed lines in FIG. 4). Thus, a simple vertical displacement of stem 57 moves valve 50 from an open to a closed position. Valve 50 is also designed so that a flow of air may be directed into head 24 and out apertures 43. As best shown in FIG. 4, the previously mentioned pressurized air supply line 59 passes through and is made integral with member 51. The top area 60 of line 59 is flattened and has four holes 61 which communicate with the interior of valve 50. A seal 62 is integrally secured to shaft 57 and when valve 50 is in the open position shown in solid lines in FIG. 4, seal 62 closes off holes 61. When valve 50 is moved to the closed position, seal 62 uncovers holes 61 so that line 59 may communicate with the interior of valve 50 and with the pick-up head 24. When valve 50 is in this closed position, the operator may place the palm of his hand over the end of exhaust pipe 77 thereby forcing a flow of air through line 59 and to apertuers 43. This slight flow of air is useful to dislodge seed which may stick to the pick-up head even after the vacuum is removed. Thus, it can be seen that the apertures 43 may be placed in three pressure conditions: (1) unpressurized (neutral pressure), (2) vacuum (negative pressure), or (3) pressurized (positive pressure). Neutral pressure is achieved either when the vacuum pump 70 is off or when the valve is closed. Negative pressure is achieved when the pump 70 is energized and the valve is allowed to remain in its normally closed position. Positive pressure is achieved when pump 70 is energized, valve 50 is closed and a flow of air is forced into line 59 by the operator placing the palm of his hand over the end of pipe 77. Turning now to a description of the means for delivering the seeds to the peat cups, a plurality of flexible plastic lines 81 extend from the respective apertures in manifold 20 downward through their respective guide tubes 82. Guide tubes 82 are held in place by adjustable positioning supports 84. FIG. 5 illustrates one of such guide tubes 82 and its respective support 84 in larger scale."

  "negative": "This application is associated with application Ser. No. 780,132, registered on March 10, 1991. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to a constant-rate discharge valve and a sphygmomanometer with electronic control that utilizes such a discharge valve. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART Previously, a standard sphygmomanometer would include a constant-rate discharge valve. This valve is situated at the opening of a rubber bulb used to inflate a medical cuff, allowing the cuff to deflate at a steady rate by the manual adjustment of a control valve. To assess blood pressure with such devices, the cuff's pressure is initially increased beyond systolic blood pressure, and is then manually regulated to deflate the cuff at a steady rate. During cuff deflation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures are determined by the detection of Korotkoff sounds. With electronic sphygmomanometers, manual adjustment of the discharge valve is not feasible. Consequently, the valve used must be designed to ensure the cuff deflates at a steady rate automatically. FIG. 4A illustrates the front view, and FIG. 4B the side view of a typical constant-rate discharge valve found in an electronic sphygmomanometer. DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION FIG. 1A presents a cross-sectional view demonstrating a first exemplary embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve, with central valve components depicted partially broken away. FIG. 1B reveals a base perspective of this constant-rate discharge valve embodiment. FIG. 2 showcases a cross-sectional view of a second embodiment featuring a partially broken away valve. FIG. 4A displays a constant-rate discharge valve as utilized in prior art from a frontal perspective; FIG. 4B shows the side perspective of the same. EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Preferred embodiments applying the constant-rate discharge valve will be discussed in further detail, referencing associated illustrations. With FIGS. 1A and 1B, we discern a cylindrical compartment 1 forming a unified upper side comprising an air entrance 6 and air exit 5, thus creating communication with the internal air cavity 4. Installation of the valve in conjunction with the sphygmomanometer employs a pliable plastic conduit, elaborated herein. The primary structure of the housing includes the outlet 5 provisioned with a control orifice 10 facilitating regulated discharge operations. Interposed within the housing, a diaphragm 8 constructed from elastic materials like rubber is positioned, capable of motions altering the volumetric capacity of air cavity 4. Employed within the diaphragm's center is a valve 11, connected through a rod 9. A valve switch element 12 is mounted atop the valve 11. Flange 13, possessing a flange port 13A, is shaped at about the midpoint of the compartment. Valve 11 can engage in states that either close off or open up the upper section of the flange 13. The scenario depicted in FIG. 1A represents a non-engaged state, permitting air to flow from the entrance 6 in the illustrated arrow's direction, through valve 11 and air cavity 4, exiting freely via outlet 5 into the external environment. Attention is given to ensuring a smooth interface between the valve base and the flange port edges, enhancing their mutual contact. To guarantee consistent and low-effort sealing on the flange port by valve 11, an annular relief 14 is present at the flange port. A fitted assembly is realized by employing camming members 1A along the housing 1 outer rim where a combined segment or lid 3 fits over the housing's external section, enabling the composite structure depicted, devoid of additional exclusive fastening components. The depicted diaphragm 8 is frequently crafted from materials like rubber or pliable plastics, encompassing an integral valve 11. An increased outer rim segment 9A promotes secure airproof closure with the compartment post-assembly. Spanning across valve 11's free end is a slim gate shaft 12, the remnant of a gate used during the integrated manufacturing process of valve 11 and diaphragm 8 through injection of rubber materials. Leaving this gate intact allows for easier handling during assembly, permitting upward pull of the gate shaft 12 thus aiding valve insertion into flange port 13A. Such assembly is streamlined as the valve is forcibly nested within the flange port. The composite segment or lid 3 is fixed in such a way to clamp diaphragm 8 between itself and the compartment, forming an airtight lock around air chamber 4. To this end, lid 3's contacting surface is matched to the compartment diameter, ensuring a tight fit. Equipped with various apertures 15, the lid also guarantees equalized pressure with external atmospheric conditions on both sides of the diaphragm. To prevent valve 11 from ejection through the flange port 13A under extreme force, such as when diaphragm 8 is exposed to excessive pressure, diaphragm 8 is designed to contact lid 3's inner face, limiting unwarranted diaphragm expansion and potential valve damage. The fitment chunk 3A, installed onto the lid 3 outer rim, interacts with the compartment's outer rim camming piece 1A, such that compression on the diaphragm's outward projection 9A is snug across its entire span. FIG. 2 illustrates an alternative design of the noted constant-rate discharge valve. Structures similar to earlier embodiments are indicated with corresponding numerals, and their descriptions are omitted. Differences unique to this iteration alone will be explored. The prevailing outlet 5 surface has threading 5a, while control orifice 10 is built with angular sections. A threaded component 20 with a tapered base section 20a, notched portion 20b, and adjustment niche 20c is hosted within threading 5a. An external space, functioning as a control passage, is shaped between control orifice 10's angular sections and screw component 20a's side surface. The flow can be fine-tuned by rotating the screw component 20 using tools like screwdrivers accessing adjustment niche 20c, thereby altering the gap that forms the control passage, with air being released via groove 20b.\n\n",
  "pos": "This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 480,648, filed Feb. 15, 1990. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a constant-rate discharge valve and an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer using such a discharge valve. 2. Description of the Prior Art Conventionally, a manual sphygmomanometer is provided with a constant-rate discharge valve. Such a valve is provided at the entrance of a rubber bulb for inflating a cuff, and the cuff is deflated at a constant rate by manually adjusting a regulating valve. In order to measure blood pressure using such a manual sphygmomanometer, first the cuff pressure is raised to a value above systolic blood pressure, after which the cuff pressure is adjusted manually by the regulating valve to deflate the cuff at a constant rate. During this deflation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measured by detecting Korotkoff sounds. In an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer, the constant-rate discharge valve cannot be manually adjusted. For this reason, the constant-rate discharge valve used is so adapted that the cuff is deflated at a constant rate. FIG. 4A is a front view of a conventional constant-rate discharge valve, and FIG. 4B is a side view of the conventional constant-rate discharge valve. These views show a typical arrangement of a constant-rate discharge valve employed in an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer. With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, there is shown a constant-rate discharge valve main body 100 having one end open to the atmosphere and another end formed into a hollow cylindrical member penetrated by a small orifice 101. The valve is fitted into a pipe T indicated by the slanting lines. As for the operation of the constant-rate valve thus constructed, air which is passed through the interior of the pipe T is discharged at a constant rate by passing through the orifice 101. Thus, the constant-rate discharge valve of the manual sphygmomanometer involves difficulty in terms of operation, as mentioned above. Though the constant-rate discharge valve of the fully automatic sphygmomanometer constructed as described above eliminates this difficulty, it is difficult to maintain the precisely machined state of the orifice, and therefore disparities in dimensions and shape arise. As a result, it is difficult to maintain a constant discharge state without variance. Another problem is that the amount of discharged air cannot be adjusted with the fully automatic sphygmomanometer constructed as described above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a constant-rate discharge valve which does not require a troublesome operation and is capable of maintaining a constant discharge state without variance, as well as a fully automatic sphygmomanometer employing this constant-rate discharge valve. Another object of the present invention is to provide a constant-rate discharge valve in which discharge flow rate can be adjusted, as well as an electronic sphygmomanometer which employs this constant-rate discharge valve. In order to attain the foregoing object, the present invention provides a constant-rate discharge valve adapted so as to render a discharge rate constant, comprising a housing having an internal air chamber and a hole open to the atmosphere, first and second air passageways each having one end open to the air chamber and communicating with each other via the air chamber, the second air passageway having a control orifice for controlling air flow rate, and a valve body disposed in the housing so as to partition the air chamber from the hole, the valve body interrupting communication between the first and second air passageways when pressure in the air chamber is greater than a predetermined pressure and permitting communication between the first and second air passageways when the pressure in the air chamber is less the predetermined pressure. In a preferred embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve, air which has flown in from the first air passageway passes through the air chamber and the control orifice and is discharged into the atmosphere from the second air passageway, at which time the valve body is actuated by a pressure difference across upstream and downstream sides of the control orifice produced by the flow rate of the entrant air, the valve body being closed by the pressure difference when the pressure difference is large and opened by the pressure difference when the pressure difference is small, whereby the flow rate of air discharged from the second air passageway is rendered constant. Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1A is a partial sectional view illustrating a first embodiment of a constant-rate discharge valve according to the present invention, in which the central portion of the valve is shown partially broken away; FIG. 1B is a bottom view showing the first embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve; FIG. 2 is a partial sectional view illustrating a second embodiment of a constant-rate discharge valve according to the present invention, in which the central portion of the valve is shown partially broken away; FIG. 3 is a schematic view of piping showing the pneumatic pressure system of an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer using the constant-rate discharge valve of the invention; FIG. 4A is a front view showing a constant-rate discharge valve according to the prior art; and FIG. 4B is a side view of the constant-rate discharge valve according to the prior art. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Preferred embodiments in which the constant-rate discharge valve of the present invention is applied will now be described with reference to the drawings. With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, there is shown a cylindrical housing 1 the upper side of which is integrally formed to have an air inlet port 6 and an air outlet port 5 in such a manner that these ports communicate with an air chamber 4 within the housing 1. The air inlet port 6 is formed as a hollow projection in such a manner that a flexible plastic tube serving as piping, described below, may be connected thereto with ease. As will be set forth later, the valve is connected to an electronic sphygmomanometer via the flexible plastic tube. The central portion of the housing 1 at which the outlet port 5 is provided is formed to have a control orifice 10 of the kind shown. Control of the discharge operation is performed via the control orifice 10. A diaphragm 8 made of rubber is disposed within the housing 1 and is capable of moving up and down in the drawing of FIG. 1A so as to vary the volume of the air chamber 4. The diaphragm 8 is provided at its approximate center with a valve 11 via a rod 9. The upper portion of the valve 11 is provided with a gate body 12. A flange 13 having a flange hole 13A is formed at approximately the central portion of the housing 1. The valve 11 is capable of assuming a state (not shown) in which its lower surface seals off the upper surface of the flange 13, and a state in which its lower surface opens the upper surface of the flange 13. This latter state is that illustrated in FIG. 1A. More specifically, with the valve 11 in the state illustrated, which is the non-actuated state, air which flows in from the inlet port 6 in the direction of the arrow in FIG. 1A passes through the gap between the lower surface of the valve 11 and the wall of the flange hole 13A, after which the air passes through the air chamber 4 and then freely through outlet port 5 to be released into the atmosphere, as indicated by the arrow. The lower surface of the valve 11 and the wall at the mouth of the flange hole 13A are formed to be smooth so that the former will come into snug abutting contact with the latter. In order that the valve 11 will reliably contact and seal off the mouth of the flange hole 13A even under the action of a very small force, the mouth of the flange hole 13A is provided with an annular projection 14. An annular clearance is defined between the inner wall of the flange hole 13A and the outer wall of the rod 9 connecting the diaphragm 8 to the valve 11. In order to achieve the required air flow rate without impediment, the dimensions of this clearance are obtained through calculation, described below. The lower surface of the housing 1 along the inner circumference thereof is smoothly finished at its surface of contact with the diaphragm 8 in order to maintain the diaphragm 8 in a hermetically sealed (air light) state with the housing 1. It is also arranged so that when the valve is assembled to clamp the diaphragm 8 between the housing 1 and a back-up body or cover 3, no air will leak from the surface of contact with the diaphragm 8 (i.e., the assembly is an air tight). Further, the housing 1 is provided over its entire outer circumference with a fitting member 1A so that when the back-up body or cover 3 is fitted onto the outer circumferential portion of the housing 1, the illustrated assembled state can be achieved even if separate, special-purpose mounting parts are not provided. The diaphragm 8 is made of rubber or flexible plastic and is integrally molded with the valve 11, as set forth above. The entire outer circumferential portion of the diaphragm 8 preferably is provided with a projection 9A that is readily depressed to form a hermetic air tight seal at the surface of contact with the housing 1 after assembly. The slender gate shaft 12 at the distal end of the valve 11 is the residue of a gate portion that is for injecting the raw material of rubber or the like when the valve 11 and diaphragm 8 are integrally molded. By leaving this gate portion attached, the gate shaft 12 can be pulled upward from the side of the inlet port 6 at the time of assembly when the valve 11 whose outer diameter is larger than the inner diameter of the flange hole 13A is passed through the flange hole 13A. By pulling up the gate shaft 12 in this manner, the valve 11 is forcibly fitted into the flange hole 13A. This facilitates the assembly operation. The back-up body or cover 3 is assembled in such a manner that the diaphragm 8 is sandwiched between it and the housing 1, as described earlier. The purpose of this is to hermetically seal the air chamber 4 by pressing the diaphragm 8 against the housing 1, and to attach the diaphragm to the housing in an air-tight state. Accordingly, the surface of the back-up body or cover 3 where it contacts the diaphragm 8 is formed so that the inner diameter of the back-up body is the same as the diameter of the housing 1. The back-up body or cover 3 is provided with open holes or openings 15 in communication with the atmosphere in order that the pressure acting upon the diaphragm will be equal to atmospheric pressure. In order to prevent the valve 11 from being forced out through the flange hole 13A owing to an excessive force which acts upon the valve 11 when the diaphragm 8 is subjected to an excessive force, the arrangement is such that the diaphragm 8 will abut against the inner surface of the back-up body or cover 3 if the diaphragm expands by more than a prescribed amount. Thus, the diaphragm 8 cannot expand excessively and the valve 11 is prevented from sustaining damage. Fitting members 3A are provided on the outer circumferential portion of the back-up body or cover 3 at eight equally spaced locations in order that these may mate with the fitting member IA provided on the outer circumferential portion of the housing 1. The dimensions of the fitting member 3A are such that the housing 1 and the outer circumferential portion of the back-up body or cover 3 will mate at a position where they will be in contact with the surface of the diaphragm 8 along its entire circumference to snugly compress the projection 9A on the outer circumferential portion of the diaphragm. In general, the amount of flexure of the diaphragm is expressed numerically in the form of a disk-shaped diaphragm whose periphery is fixed. The details are also set forth in handbooks on mechanical engineering. Letting P represent the desired pressure, d the clearance between the valve 11 and the inner wall of the flange hole 13A, t the thickness of the diaphragm 8, R the radius of the diaphragm 8 and E Young&#39;s modulus of the diaphragm 8, we have the following equation: ##EQU1## In the foregoing equation, 1/m is Poisson&#39;s ratio, which is approximately 0.5 for rubber; hence, m=2. If rubber having a Young&#39;s modulus of 24 kgf/cm 2 is used and the valve is set to operate at a pressure of 20 mmHg, then the pressure will be P=20 mmHg=0.026 kgf/cm 2. Therefore, if the diaphragm has a radius of 1 cm and a thickness of 0.1 cm, we have ##EQU2## Thus, the dimensions of the various parts should be set in such a manner that the clearance between the valve and the wall of the flange hole will be 1.52 mm. Rubber, besides exhibiting viscoelasticity, is such that the Young&#39;s modulus thereof varies widely with the temperature at which it is used. In addition, the precision of the operating pressure of a rubber diaphragm varies widely owing to the influence of temperature and the like. Moreover, in terms of designing a valve which operates at high pressure, diaphragm thickness is very large because the Young&#39;s modulus of rubber is exceedingly small. Accordingly, it is permissible to superimpose a metal diaphragm on the abovementioned rubber diaphragm 8, thus constructing a valve which will operate at high pressure even with use of the rubber diaphragm 8. The metal diaphragm can be made of, e.g., stainless steel, in which case Young&#39;s modulus would be as large as 2\u00d7107 kgf/cm 2. Therefore, the operating pressure of the valve would be determined not from the elastic force of rubber but from the physical properties of a substantially metal diaphragm. It is also permissible to cut away a portion of the metal diaphragm. FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve of the invention, in which portions similar to those shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are designated by like reference characters and need not be described again. Only structural elements different from those of the embodiment of FIGS. 1A and 1B will be described. The inner circumferential surface of the outlet port 5 of the constant-rate discharge valve is formed to have threads 5a, and the control orifice 10 is shaped to have angular portions, of the kind shown, at its upper and lower parts. A screw body 20 threadedly engaged with the threads 5a has a conical lower portion 20a, a groove portion 20b and an adjustment recess 20c. A clearance, namely a control passage, is formed between the angular portions of the control orifice 10 and the outer circumferential surface of the conical portion 20a. In order to adjust the control passage, a screwdriver or the like is inserted into the adjustment recess 20c and the screw body 20 is turned to regulate the clearance formed between the angular portions of the control orifice 10 and the outer circumferential surface of the conical portion 20a. Air is discharged by passing through the groove 20b. FIG. 3 shows the overall piping T of an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer employing the constant-rate discharge valve 1. A cuff 34 and a motor-driven pump 24 are connected by a four-branch pipe junction T1 and a two-branch pipe junction T2. The inlet port 6 of the constant-rate discharge valve 1 is connected to the upwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1. A pressure sensor 32 is connected via a two-branch pipe junction T2 to the leftwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1, and the cuff 34 is connected to the leftwardly directed portion of this two-branch pipe junction T2. The outlet port of a filter device 30 comprising a fluidic resistor and a fluid buffer bag is connected to the downwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1. The motor-driven pump 24 is connected to the inlet port of the filter device 30 via a two-branch pipe junction T2. Connected to the upwardly directed portion of this pipe junction T2 via another two-branch pipe junction T2 are a bypass valve 26 having an electromagnetically driven solenoid, and a discharge valve 22 similarly having an electromagnetically driven solenoid. When the pressure within the cuff 34 is less than 20 mmHg in this electronic automatic sphygmomanometer thus connected, air from the motor-driven pump 24 is caused to flow directly into the cuff 34 to inflate and deflate the cuff efficiently in a short period of time. Specifically, when cuff pressure is less than 20 mmHg, the bypass valve 26 is in the open state to allow passage of the air therethrough. As a result, the air flows directed from the pump 24 to the interior of the cuff 34. When the cuff pressure rises to a value greater than 20 mmHg, on the other hand, the bypass valve 26 is closed to prevent air from passing through it. As a result, the air passes through the filter device 30 interposed in the pneumatic line extending from the motor-driven pump 24 to the cuff 34. The filter device 30, which comprises the abovementioned filtering elements such as the fluidic resistance element, functions as a rectifying circuit. As a result, the cuff 34 is supplied with air at a constant rate without any pulsation in cuff pressure when blood pressure is measured."

  "negative": "The disclosed innovation relates to a skin-penetrating system without needles for administering medicinal substances. Notably, this system encompasses a dispensing unit equipped with a fluidic compartment for storing the medicinal substance and an actuating mechanism. The dispensing unit features an aperture that communicates with the fluidic compartment, facilitating the movement of the medicinal substance into and out of the compartment. Ideally, this dispensing unit is designed for detachable attachment and may be preloaded with a medicinal substance or even be disposable. A projecting member emerges from the dispensing unit to tighten the skin, enabling the system to breach the tightened skin at substantially reduced force compared to the force typically required to pierce the skin. In a particular embodiment, the projecting member is designed to be retractable within the dispensing unit such that upon activation, the projecting member is propelled outwards. This process stretches the skin, easing the entry of the drug. Post-administration, the projecting member retracts due to an elastic component. Various embodiments incorporate distinct retraction methods, including a membrane, a seal, a spring, or any combination thereof. The innovative system presents an injection-assisting component that retracts within a conventional dispensing body. The system includes a component with an orifice at the end, tied to a cylindrical compartment concluding in a progressively narrowing conical shape. A plunger is positioned within the cylindrical compartment, capable of sliding as required. The plunger also has a barrier wall contoured to the conical shape for optimal positioning.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/359,790 filed Jul. 26, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,371 and claims the benefit of provisional application No. 60/094,167 filed Jul. 27, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a device for delivery of medicament, and in particular to a jet injector with a skin tensioning probe to reduce the pressure at which the jet injector must eject the medicament for proper delivery. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A wide variety of needleless injectors are known in the art. Examples of such injectors include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,302 issued to Lilley et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,830 to Dunlap, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,790,824 to Morrow et al. In general, these and similar injectors administer medication as a fine, high velocity jet delivered under sufficient pressure to enable the jet to pass through the skin and enter the underlying tissues. These injectors typically have a nozzle assembly which has a barrel-like nozzle body having a medication holding chamber and an orifice through which a jet stream of medication is expelled from the chamber. Typically a plunger/piston actuated by an energy source, such as a coil spring, gas spring, or gas cartridge is used to expel the medicament. Since at least the 1980s, the use of needleless injectors has become more desirable due to concerns over the spread of AIDS, hepatitis and other viral diseases caused by the possibility of accidental needle \u201csticks\u201d from the conventional syringe and needle. One of the advantages associated with jet injectors is the absence of a hypodermic needle which removes apprehensions of healthcare workers and are superior in eliminating accidental disease transmission. Furthermore, given the aversion to needles possessed by some, the absence of a needle provides a psychological benefit. Even devices that utilize conventional hypodermic needles have attempted to capitalize on this psychological benefit. For example, self-injectors or auto-injectors like the ones disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,553,962, 4,378,015 have retractable needles which are hidden until activation. Upon activation, the needle extends from the bottom of the device and penetrates the user&#39;s skin to deliver medicament. As none of these devices involves delivery of the medicament using jet injection, the medicament delivery location is limited by the length of the needle. As the skin is a tissue composed of several layers and the injector is applied to the external surface of the outermost layer, the delivery pressure must be high enough to penetrate all layers of the skin. The layers of skin include, the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, the dermis, and the subcutaneous region. The required delivery pressure is typically greater than approximately 4,000 p.s.i., as measured by the force of the stream of fluid divided by the cross-sectional area of the stream of fluid. Although this pressure is readily achievable with most injectors, there are some circumstances in which delivery under a reduced pressure is desirable. For instance, certain medications which contain molecules with long protein chains can be sheared and rendered ineffective when expelled at high pressures. Reduced pressure delivery is particularly useful in intradermal applications such as vaccine, specifically DNA vaccines in which a high force energy mechanism could disrupt the molecular structure. See \u201cIntradermal DNA Immunization by Using Jet-Injectors in Mice and Monkeys,\u201d Vaccine, 17:628\u201338, February 1999. Also, operation of the needleless injector at lower pressures can allow for a larger volume of medicament to be administered. Furthermore, the lower pressure could make manufacturing an injector device less expensive. The lower pressure would also reduce adverse stresses on the device and result in a corresponding increased useable device lifetime. Thus, there exists a need for a jet injector with an injection assisting probe to reduce the pressure at which the jet injector must eject the medicament for proper delivery. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is drawn to a needleless injection system for injecting a medical product, and in particular, to a portable hand held device for injecting a medical product into a patient. The present invention is additionally drawn to an improved probe that can be used with a needleless injector. The needleless injector according to the present invention comprises a nozzle assembly having an fluid chamber for holding the medical product and an energy mechanism or energy means. The nozzle assembly has an orifice in fluid communication with the fluid chamber for allowing passage of the medical product in and out of the fluid chamber. The nozzle assembly is preferably removably connected and can be prefilled with a medical product if desired or can even be of a disposable type. A probe extends from the nozzle assembly to tension the skin and allow the jet to puncture the taut skin at a pressure that is substantially lower than the pressure normally needed to penetrate the skin. In one embodiment, the probe is retractably disposed within the nozzle assembly such that when the injector is fired, the probe is forced out of the end of the nozzle assembly. This stretches the skin, allowing the drug to enter the skin more easily. The diameter of the probe tip is smaller than the diameter of the opening at the distal end of the injector so that the probe tip can move within the opening. After the device has completed the injection, the probe is forced back into the nozzle assembly by a retractable means or mechanism. An O-ring or a spring typically provides the force necessary to retract the probe. Another aspect of the present invention includes the use of different retracting means. Either a membrane, O-ring seal and spring, or a coil spring may be used in any combination for this purpose. In another embodiment, the probe is rigidly disposed in the nozzle assembly in a fixed position and extends outwardly therefrom. In another embodiment, the probe is a metal cylinder inserted or molded in the injector to provide a large discharge channel length to orifice diameter ratio, i.e., in the range of at least about 6/1 to as high as 20/1 or even greater. In another embodiment, the rigid probe nozzle assembly is assembled from two separate pieces that can be joined either by being snapped together or otherwise interlocked, including by friction fitting, by being joined with an adhesive or by being ultrasonically bonded together. In yet another embodiment, the nozzle ratio of discharge channel length to orifice diameter is large, i.e., in the range of at least about 6/1 to as high as 20/1 or even greater, with a long and gradual approach angle of about 3 to 30 degrees.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For convenience, the same or equivalent elements of the invention of embodiments illustrated in the drawings have been identified with the same reference numerals. Further, in the description that follows, any reference to either orientation or direction is intended primarily for the convenience of description and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention thereto. As used in this application, the term distal shall designate the end or direction toward the front of the needleless injection device 10. The term proximal shall designate the end or direction toward the rear of the injector. The term longitudinal designates an axis connecting the nozzle assembly 20 to the needleless injection device 10 , and the term transverse designates a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction including arcs along the surface of needleless injection device 10 , or nozzle assembly 20. Referring to FIG. 1 , the needleless injection device 10 according to the present invention, comprises a nozzle assembly 20 , an energy generating means 40 for forcing medicament out of the nozzle assembly, and an actuating mechanism 90 , and a trigger assembly 100 for activating and triggering the energy mechanism 40. These components are operatively contained within a housing 200 as shown. It should be noted that energy generating means 40 can be a coil spring, gas spring, gas propellant, or any other force generating means. The nozzle assembly 20 can be threadably connected to the housing 200 or the actuating mechanism 90 such that it can be readily attached and detached. In this manner, the needleless injection device 10 can be reused with various nozzle assemblies 20 that may contain different medications of different doses either together or at different times. For instance, the nozzle assembly 20 can be prefilled with medication and disposed of after each use. Further, a medication filling device such as a coupling device can be used to fill the fluid chamber with medication. According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the nozzle assembly 20 has an injection assisting probe movable within a conventional nozzle body. The nozzle assembly 20 includes a nozzle member 22 having an opening 24 at the distal end, preferably having a diameter of about 0.04\u20130.4 inches, preferably of about 0.045 to 0.075 inches or any other suitable diameter that would allow for the introduction of an injection assisting probe therein. The nozzle member 22 includes a cylindrical fluid chamber 26 terminating at the distal end in a right circular cone 28. A plunger 30 having a pressure wall contoured to the cone 28 is positioned to slide within the fluid chamber 26. The plunger 30 can include sealing means such as one or more O-rings or the like (not shown) that are formed around its outer periphery to provide a seal, or the plunger itself can be a seal, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,830, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The plunger can also include additional sealing means at spaced intervals to provide a better seal. In the embodiments shown, the plunger 30 is connected to a ram 32 which is connected to the energy mechanism 40. Alternatively the ram 32 can be integrally formed with an energy mechanism, if desired. An injection assisting probe 50 , as seen best in FIGS. 7\u20138 , is positioned coaxially and retractably within the distal end of the fluid chamber 26. The injection assisting probe 50 has a plunger receptor 57 at the proximal end which is configured to accommodate the plunger 30 as it slides within the fluid chamber 26. Although the plunger receptor 57 can be of any shape conforming to the exterior profile of the plunger, it is preferably conical. The probe inner wall 58 is contoured to narrow like a funnel to the probe discharge channel 56. The probe discharge channel 56 extends to the discharge orifice 59 at the distal end of the probe. The probe discharge orifice 59 has a diameter of 0.004 to 0.012 inches. Preferably the diameter is 0.005 to 0.0075 inches. The discharge channel 56 is preferably cylindrical with a length to diameter ratio greater than 6. To provide a seal, the probe can include a sealing means such as an O-ring(s) 35 or the like, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 , formed around its outer periphery and accommodated by slot 60 or the probe itself can be a seal. The probe preferably has a ridge 55 , the distal surface of which provides an annular area that can compress a spring or other like retractable mechanism when the needleless injection device is triggered. Alternatively, a washer can be used instead of the ridge 55 to contain the O-ring 35 and compress the retracting mechanism during operation. FIGS. 5 and 6 show the nozzle assembly prior to introduction of the injection assisting probe. The outer periphery of the probe can be of varied geometries such that it fits within the nozzle member fluid chamber 26. Advantageously, the probe has a conical body section 54 which narrows gradually or tapers towards a cylindrical body section 53 of smaller circumference. Preferably, a shoulder 52 is positioned to separate the probe tip 51 from the cylindrical body section 53. The probe tip 51 is also cylindrical, but has a smaller circumference than the cylindrical body section 53 such that the probe tip can fit within and extend through the nozzle opening 24. The cylindrical body section 53 of the probe has a circumference such that the shoulder section 52 , existing at the transition between the cylindrical body section 53 and the probe tip 51 , prevents the cylindrical body section 53 of the probe from existing within the opening 24. FIG. 2 illustrates the retractable injection assisting probe 50 in its neutral position while FIG. 3 illustrates the probe 50 in its extended position. In the extended position, the probe tip 51 extends beyond the distal end of the nozzle face 25. The shoulder 52 abuts the bored out inner section 27 of the nozzle opening to stop the probe from traveling further. The retracting mechanism, in this embodiment a spring, is compressed to provide a recoil force once the medicament is expelled. FIG. 4 illustrates another aspect of the present invention where a nozzle assembly with a nozzle member cap 85 attached on, for example by screws, to a modified nozzle member wherein a retractable probe is disposed. Although FIG. 4 shows the retractable means as a spring, there is no limitation as to the retractable means which can be used with such a screw on nozzle assembly. In this regard, a resilient O-ring, a flexible membrane, a gas spring, or any other retractable means known to those skilled in the art can also be used. FIGS. 9 , 10 , and 11 show an alternative embodiment of the injection assisting probe in which the retraction mechanism is a resilient O-ring 75 , or other like material known to those skilled in the art. A coil spring can be used instead of the O-ring. When the O-ring 75 is used, it can also act as a sealing mechanism, and for this reason the O-ring is preferred. The interior of the probe is similar to the other embodiments, with a section 57 to accommodate the plunger and a tapered section 58 to funnel the medicament to the discharge channel 56 and out the discharge orifice 59 during operation. FIG. 10 illustrates the neutral condition, before expelling medicament, and FIG. 11 shows the extended condition during which medicament is expelled. Similar to embodiments previously described, this embodiment functions to extend the probe tip 51 beyond the nozzle opening 24 and tension the patient&#39;s skin during operation. Also, similar to embodiments previously described, this retractable probe also preferably has a ridge 55 around the proximal end to provide a surface which compresses the resilient material when the injector is triggered. Another embodiment of the present invention, shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 , is a variation of the retraction means wherein a flexible membrane is utilized. FIG. 12 illustrates the neutral condition before expelling the medicament. A flexible membrane 70 spans between nozzle walls 71 which define the sides of the fluid chamber 26 for holding medicament. Similar to embodiments previously described, the distal end of the nozzle walls act to guard the probe by extending beyond the membrane the same distance the probe does. The probe is attached to the flexible membrane by any conventional means known to those skilled in the art."

An optional grounding rod can be added.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The invention relates to bird feeders, and more specifically to a bird feeder having a top cap that may be rotated off of, and away from, the body for filling and cleaning purposes, but remain attached to the feeder. This is accomplished through the use of a rotatable wire bail attached to the body by bail retaining pins. The invention also has a readily removable base cap that can be detached and easily reattached for cleaning purposes without the use of tools. The feeder has various alternative embodiments, including a body manufactured of plastic with rotatable perches and embodiments where the body is made of perforated metal with various feed hole sizes. The feeder may also have a tray attachment. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] There are various sizes and configurations of bird feeders that are used to provide wild birds with a ready supply of food, mainly in the form of seed. Many feeders provide a tray and/or perch on which the bird may rest as it feeds. Most tubular shaped feeders are designed to hang from tree limbs or poles in a manner that allows access from all sides so that multiple birds may feed at once from the same feeder. Hooks or wire bails are commonly used in the industry to hang the feeder from a tree limb or pole. [0003] One problem encountered is that feeders are hung outdoors and the feeder and its contents are exposed to the elements. If the seed gets wet due to exposure to precipitation, it can be subject to decay and the growth of mold or mildew, making it undesirable for feeding purposes. Under such circumstances, the body of the feeder needs to be thoroughly cleaned and refilled with undamaged seed. Furthermore, the body needs to be accessed on a regular basis for refilling as it is emptied of its contents by the feeding birds. [0004] Because of the constant exposure to precipitation and sunlight, the body of the feeder in which the seed is contained needs to be covered, which is also helpful to prevent excess spillage. Generally, the opening at the top of tubular feeders is relatively small compared to the length of the tubular body. The lid covering of most feeders of this type must be removed, or at least partially removed, in order to fill the feeder. Because of the relatively small top opening, the body must be filled carefully to avoid wasteful spilling of seed. [0005] Consequently, it is important to have a feeder that provides easy access to the body, both for filling and cleaning purposes. Although most feeders may open to some extent on top for filling purposes, it is quite difficult with a long tubular feeder to thoroughly clean the feeder without having a removable top and bottom so that the entire tube may be accessed and cleaned. [0006] Therefore, it is desirable to provide a bird feeder that provides complete and clear access to the interior of the feeder for filling and cleaning purposes. Toward this objective, it is desirable to provide a feeder without any obstructions inside the feeder near the top opening thereto. It is also desirable to provide a feeder body that is durable and will withstand potential damage caused by exposure to the elements. It is another desirable objective to provide a feeder having a top cap that is removably attached to the body. It is also desirable to provide a feeder that has an easily removable bottom cap that can be removed and reattached without the use of tools for cleaning purposes. It is also desirable to have perches that can rotate to provide different configurations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] It is an object of the present invention to provide a bird feeder having an interior which can be fully accessed for efficient filling and cleaning purposes. [0008] It is an object of the present invention to provide a feeder that is easier and less expensive to manufacture. [0009] It is an object of the invention to provide a feeder that can be modified to accommodate different feed. [0010] It is a further object of the invention to provide a feeder that is durable when exposed to the elements. [0011] It is also an object of the invention to provide a feeder with a top cap that is removably attached to the feeder opening for cleaning and filling purposes. [0012] It is a further object of the invention to provide a feeder having a bottom cap that can be easily removed and reattached without the use of tools. [0013] It is a further object of the invention to provide a feeder having rotatable perches.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0035] In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings which form a part of this application, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments can be utilized and that various changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, in the detailed description, like numerals are employed to designate like parts throughout the disclosure. [0036] Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The elements of the feeder shown in FIG. 1 and their relationship to each other are even more apparent in the exploded view of the feeder as shown in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, the body 12 of the feeder 10 is generally tubular in shape. The body 12 , as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 , is manufactured of clear or colored plastic material that is substantial enough to withstand exposure to sun, precipitation and changes in temperature, such as polycarbonate. However, as later discussed, the body 12 could alternatively be comprised of other material including perforated or expanded metal. Preferably, the body 12 , as shown in FIG. 2 , is open at both a top end 14 and a bottom end 16 , having an interior 18 and an exterior 20. [0037] At the bottom end 16 is a base cap 22 that is removable from, but securely fastened to, the feeder 10. The base cap 22 is preferably manufactured of die cast metal but can be made of various materials, including plastic. As shown in FIG. 2 , the base cap 22 is generally tubular in shape and designed to fit inside the body 12. The upper portion 26 of the base cap 22 is configured to fit easily, but snuggly inside the interior 18 of the body 12. The rim portion 28 is of greater diameter than the body 12 , forming a lip 29. In this manner, the upper portion 26 of the base cap 22 fits securely inside the body 12. When the base cap 22 is fitted inside the body 12 , the body 12 rests on the lip 29 of the rim portion 28 of the base cap 22 as shown in FIG. 1. [0038] In a preferred embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 , the base cap 22 has a notch 30 forming an integral part of the upper portion 26 and extending above the lip 29 of the rim portion 28. The notch 30 is preferably of the same shape as a cutout notch 32 (shown in FIG. 2 ) on the bottom end 16 of the body 12 , but slightly smaller, so that it can be aligned with the cutout notch 32 when the body 12 is seated on the base cap 22. The base cap 22 also has two base holes 34 therein, one directly opposite the other, located on the upper portion 26 , slightly above the lip 29 of the rim portion 28 of the base cap 22 on which the body 12 rests when the upper portion 26 of the base cap 22 is inserted therein (see FIG. 9 ). The body 12 likewise has two body holes 36 therein, one directly opposite the other, situated the same distance from the bottom end 16 of the body 12 as the base holes 34 are from the lip 29 of the rim portion 28 and the same distance in each direction from the cutout notch 32 as the base holes 34 are from the notch 30. [0039] As shown in FIGS. 2 and 8 , the base cap 22 is attached to the body 12 by inserting the upper portion 26 into the interior 18 of the body 12 and mating the notch 30 on base cap 22 with the cutout notch 32 on the body 12 so that the bottom end 16 rests on the lip 29 , whereby the two base holes 34 are aligned with the two body holes 36 , resulting in two sets of aligned holes. As best illustrated in FIG. 9 , a first end 40 of a spring clip 38 is then inserted into one set of an aligned base hole 34 and body hole 36 and a second end 42 is then inserted into the second set of an aligned base hole 34 and body hole 36. When both ends 40 and 42 are attached to the body 12 and base cap 22 in this manner, the spring force of the spring clip 38 locks the base cap 22 securely onto the body 12. [0040] In a preferred embodiment of the tubular shaped feeder shown, the spring clip 38 is in a curved shape to generally conform to the curvature of the body 12 , as shown in FIG. 9. However, the spring clip 38 can be configured differently to accommodate different feeder shapes as a method of attachment of a base cap 22 to a feeder body 12. Preferably, the first end 40 of the spring clip 38 is straight and angled inwardly for easier insertion into the body 12 and the base cap 22. The second end 42 of the spring clip 40 is preferably looped for grasping purposes and then angled inwardly for easier insertion into the body 12 and the base cap 22. However, other configurations of the spring clip 38 are possible and are intended to be included herein. [0041] If it is desired that the base cap 22 be removed for cleaning or some other purpose, one can simply pull the loop 43 away from the feeder 10 on the second end 42 of the spring clip 38 to release the spring clip 38 and remove it at both the first end 40 and the second end 42 from both the base cap 22 and the body 12. The spring clip 38 is reattached most easily by aligning the notch 30 with the cutout notch 32 and the bottom end 16 of the body 12 with the lip 29 of the rim portion 28 of the base cap 22. The first end 40 of the spring clip 38 is then inserted into one aligned set of a body hole 36 and a base hole 34 and the second end 42 is inserted into the other aligned set of a body hole 36 and a base hole 34 , while holding the loop 43 at the second end 42. In this manner, the base cap 12 can be readily removed from the body 12 and reattached efficiently and as desired without the use of tools. Furthermore, minimal strength is required to release or reaffix the spring clip 38. This novel attachment means is desirable for the birdwatcher, who may be refilling feeders or cleaning them outdoors, sometimes in inclement weather where tools may not be easily available or may be easily lost or misplaced under snow or vegetation. [0042] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 , the body 12 has a plurality of feeder ports 44. The feeder ports 44 are of generally conventional construction and are assembled and attached by screws or other means so they extend inwardly in the body 12 from opposite sides thereof, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 8. The feeder ports 44 are preferably of generally square or rectangular construction and can be made of die cast metal although other shapes, as well as materials, including plastic, are feasible. The port openings 46 are angled downwardly to permit the birds better access to the feed. Protective port rims 48 , of larger dimension than the port openings 46 in the body 12 through which the feeder ports 44 extend, keep the feeder ports 44 in position on the body 12 and protect the body 12 from damage by birds or other animals. The protective port rims 48 , in the preferred embodiment, are manufactured of die cast metal to enhance durability, although they could be manufactured of plastic or other materials. [0043] As shown in FIG. 8 , the protective port rims 48 are shaped to extend substantially below the port openings 46 , each extended portion 50 having a vertical channel 52 extending upwardly for a short distance (approximately \u00be\u2033) in the direction of the center of the port openings 46 with the protective port rims 48 snuggly fitted against the exterior 20 of the body 12. Additionally, the protective port rims 48 are configured with a generally square indentation 54 located on the side of each extended portion 50 facing the body 12 when the feeder 10 is assembled. [0044] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 8 , in a preferred embodiment, the perches 56 are configured of cast metal and, at a first end 58 , resemble branches, having two perch arms 60 and a flat, generally square retention portion 62 at a second end 64 , such retention portion 62 of a size and shape to fit into and mate with the indentation 54 in the protective port rim 48. Shapes other than square are feasible for mating the indentation 54 of the protective port rim 48 with the retention portion 62 of the perch 56. However, the generally square shape shown allows the rotation of the perches 56 as desired in 45\u00b0 increments, and provides for the perches 56 to lock into place as the retention portion 62 is rotated 45\u00b0 behind the protective port rims 48. The perches 56 can be configured in various ways at the first end 58 , and could have more or less perch arms 60 and symmetrical or nonsymmetrical perch arms 60 as desired. The perches 56 could also be manufactured of plastic or other materials although they are manufactured of die cast metal in a preferred embodiment. [0045] It should be understood that the retention portion 62 can be configured in various ways, but preferably mates with the indentation 54 in the protective port rims 48 to hold the perches 56 securely in place."

  "query": "What is the release profile of the active agent in a multiplex oral drug delivery system with scored extended-release compartments?,",
  "negative": "The multiplex drug delivery system is designed for oral administration and consists of multiple release compartments without scoring. Each compartment contains an agent with distinct release profiles that are not designed to match either the intact system or each other when separated. The system aims to deliver a combination of drugs with varying release times to cater to different absorption rates needed for complex treatment regimens, enhancing therapeutic effectiveness without the requirement for patient modification of the drug unit.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a single drug delivery unit suitable for oral administration containing at least two distinct drug dosage packages. This multiplex system contains at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The scored nature of the extended-release *compartment facilitates the separation by the patient of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage. Upon separation, each individual drug dosage package can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the separability of the multiplex drug delivery system enables its use throughout the entire course of a varying dosage regimen, and thus, facilitates cost effective patient compliance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Drug efficacy depends upon the maintenance of the proper therapeutic levels of the drug over the required treatment period. With respect to orally administered drugs, the effectiveness of treatment depends, in part or sometimes in whole, on patient compliance with the prescribed dosage regimen. Particularly where the prescribed dosage increases or decreases during the treatment period, patient compliance can suffer because of the unavailability of, or inconvenience in obtaining, the appropriate dosage of the prescribed medication at different times. It would therefore be beneficial for patients to have one drug delivery unit that allows patients themselves to regulate the amount of drug to administer. Such a capability would enable patients to use the same drug delivery unit throughout their entire treatment period even where their prescribed dosage changes during that time. Patients in such circumstances would have the convenience and cost effectiveness of obtaining in one unit and at the same time the different dosages of their prescribed drug that would be needed during their treatment period. A valuable contribution to the art therefore would be the development of a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration containing at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment that facilitates the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is a single drug delivery unit suitable for oral administration that patients could separate into individual drug dosage packages. These individual drug dosage packages can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent when compared to one another or when compared to the entire, intact multiplex drug delivery system. The present invention accomplishes this objective through a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration containing at least two immediate-release compartments. The scored extended-release compartment of the invention allows the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. One preferred embodiment of the claimed invention is a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration comprising at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The extended-release compartment can comprise a combination of a hydrophobic and a hydrophobic material. In such an embodiment, the hydrophilic polymer(s) dissolves away to weaken the extended-release compartment, while the hydrophobic material retards the water, thus helping to preserve the integrity of the drug delivery system. Where the immediate-release compartments are inert (i.e., do not comprise an active agent), they can facilitate a bursting effect, which can disrupt any remaining integrity of the extended-release compartment. In another preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, each immediate-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the scored extended-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with the combination of a hydrophilic polymer and a hydrophobic material. In a further preferred embodiment, each immediate-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with a polymer. In one other preferred embodiment, the scored extended-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with the combination of a hydrophilic polymer and a hydrophobic material. By varying the composition of the polymer(s) in the immediate-release compartments and/or the relative composition of the hydrophilic polymer and hydrophobic material in the extended-release compartment, the respective time periods for the dissolution of the active agent or the bursting effect can be adjusted. In a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, the active agent contained in the multiplex drug delivery system can be a drug. In other embodiments, that drug can be a therapeutic or a prophylactic drug. In one preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, the drug of the multiplex drug delivery system can be diltiazem, trapidil, urapidil, benziodarone, dipyridamole, isosorbide mononitrate, or lidoflazine. In another embodiment, the drug can be a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroidal antiinflammatory drug.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic of one preferred embodiment of the multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration, which contains two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The scored extended-release compartment of the invention allows the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. In this preferred embodiment, the multiplex system consists of an oblong tablet scored in the middle to allow for easy breaking of the tablet. Each half of the tablet contains an immediate-release compartment located concentrically within the round tablet edges, allowing for a slightly thicker wall from the center edge when the tablet is broken in half. The distance between immediate-release compartments need not be greater than twice the distance between the interface of the immediate-release and extended-release compartments and that of the extended-release compartment and the outer surface or optional cosmetic compartment, so long as once separated, each individual drug dosage package can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention, the term \u201cactive agent\u201d includes one or more drugs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pro-drug forms, metabolites, and derivatives. Active agents include therapeutic or prophylactic compounds as described in the Physicians&#39; Desk Reference, most preferably including (but not limited to) those prescribed for the prevention and/or treatment of angina and hypertension: diltiazem, trapidil, urapidil, benziodarone, dipyridamole, isosorbide mononitrate, and lidoflazine; and those prescribed for the prevention and/or treatment of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis: non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroidal antiinflanrmatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diflunisal, piroxicam, motrin, and naproxen, and combinations thereof. The active agent of the present invention also preferably includes drugs that are subject to the first pass effect. Various examples of such drugs include (but are not limited to) acetaminophen, aldosterone, alprenolol, amitryptyline, aspirin, beclomethasone, diproprionate, bromocriptine, butorphanol tartrate, chlormethiazole, chlorpheniramine, chlorpromazine HCl, cimetidine, codeine, cortisone, cyclobenzamine HCl, desmethylimipramine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydroergotamine, diltiazem HCl, dobutamine HCl, domperidone, dopamine HCl, doxepin HCl, epinephrine, ergoloid mesylates, ergotamine tartrate estradiol, ethinylestradiol, flunisolide, fluorouracil, flurazepamn HCl, 5-fluoro-21-deoxyuridine, furosemide, glipizide, glyburide, glyceryl trinitrate, guanethidine sulfate, hydralazine HCl, imipramine HCl, indoramin, isoethorine HCl, isoethrine mesylate, isoprenaline, isoproterenol sulfate, isosorbide dinitrate, levallorphan tartrate, levodopa, lidocaine HCl, lignocaine, lorcainide, meperidine HCl, 6-mercaptopurine, metaproterenol sulfate, methoxamine HCl, methylphenidate, methylpreonisolone, methyltestosterone mesylate, metoclopramide, metoprolol tartrate, morphine sulfate, nalbuphine HCl, naloxone HCl, neostigmine, nifedipine, nitrendipine, nitroglycerin, norepinephrine bitartrate, norethindrone, nortriptylene HCl, oxprenolol, oxyphenbutazone, penicillamine, pentazocine HCl, pentazocine lactate, pentobarbital, petnidine, phenacetin, phentolamine HCl, phentolamine mesylate, phenylephrine HCl, phenylephrine bitartrate, phenytoin, pindolal, prazosin, prednisone, progesterone, propoxyphene HCl, propoxyphene napsylate, propranolol HCl, quinidine, reserpine, ritodrine HCl, salicylamide, salbutamol, secobarbital, testosterone, terbutaline, timolol maleate, tolbutamide, and verapamil HCl. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the active agent may include the drug, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, an organic nitrate, which is a vasodilator with effects on both arteries and veins. The empirical formula is C 6 H 9 NO 6 and the molecular weight is 191.14. The chemical name for isosorbide mononitrate is 1,4:3,6-dihydro-D-glucitrol 5-nitrate. Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate can be attributable to the mononitrate. A principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins is known to promote peripheral pooling of blood and decrease venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular and diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. The mechanism by which isosorbide mononitrate relieves angina pecteria is not fully understood. Isosorbide mononitrate is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In humans, isosorbide mononitrate is not subject to first pass metabolism in the liver. The overall elimination half-life of isosorbide mononitrate is about 6 hours. The rate of clearance is the same in healthy young adults, and in patients with various degrees of renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction. In accordance with the present invention, the term \u201cpolymer\u201d includes single or multiple polymeric substances, which can swell, gel, degrade or erode on contact with anaqueous environment (e.g., water), such as one or more of alginic acid, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, guar gum, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, starch, ethylcellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, povidone, pregelatinized starch, shellac, and zein, and combinations thereof. The \u201chydrophilic polymers\u201d of the present invention include one or more of carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, and povidone. The \u201chydrophobic materials\u201d of the present invention include one or more of carriauba wax, ethylcellulose, glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, microcrystalline wax, polymethacrylates, and stearic acid. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art, using the preceding description, can practice the present invention to the fullest extent. The following examples are illustrative only, and not limiting of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. EXAMPLES The method below was employed to obtain a multiplex drug delivery system, the composition of which is set forth in the tables immediately following in Table 1: Immediate-Release Compartment. Isosorbide mononitrate was first mixed with silicon dioxide in a Patterson-Kelley V-blender together with microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellulose sodium, and magnesium stearate for 15 minutes. The powder blend was then compressed using a Manesty Dry-cota with a {fraction (3/16)}\u2033 diameter, round, flat-face punch and die set. The hardness of the tablets were maintained at 4\u00b12kp. Immediate-Release Compartment Plus Extended-Release Compartment Isosorbide mononitrate was mixed with silicon dioxide in a Patterson-Kelley V-blender together with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208, microcrystalline cellulose, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and magnesium stearate for 15 minutes. The core tablets were press-coated using a Korsch Core Coater {fraction (5/16)}\u2033\u00d7\u00be\u2033 capsule shape punches. The hardness of the tablets were maintained at 12\u00b14 kp. In addition, the formulation of respective release compartments can occur by appropriate granulation methods. In wet granulation, solutions of the binding agent (polymer) are added with stirring to the mixed powders. The powder mass is wetted with the binding solution until the mass has the consistency of damp snow or brown sugar. The wet granulated material is forced through a sieving device. Moist material from the milling step is dried by.placing it in a temperature controlled container. After drying, the granulated material is reduced in particle size by passing through a sieving device. Lubricant is added, and the final blend is then compressed. In fluid-bed granulation, particles of inert material and/or active agent are suspended in a vertical column with a rising air stream. While the particles are suspended, the common granulating materials in solution are sprayed into the column. There is a gradual particle buildup under a controlled set of conditions resulting in tablet granulation. Following drying and the addition of lubricant, the granulated material is ready for compression. In dry-granulation, the active agent, diluent, and lubricant are blended and compressed into large tablets."

  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62/240,409 filed Oct. 12, 2015 entitled Radioabsorbent Assemblies, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention pertains to various embodiments of radiation shields to protect physicians and other health care workers present during procedures requiring real-time X-ray imaging. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Radiation exposure during medical procedures requiring x-rays or other ionizing radiation is a major health concern for health care workers (HCW). Procedures requiring real-time imaging, such as percutaneous procedures, involve a patient on a table with an x-ray device mounted on a C-arm, known as an x-ray gantry. The radiation is emitted from a \u201ctube\u201d on the bottom of the C-arm and is directed upward through the bottom of the table and the patient. The physician and other attending HCWs are typically standing next to the table attending the patient and are subject to the radiation. [0004] Most of the radiation exposure to the HCWs emanate from x-ray photons that are reflected off of the patient&#39;s bones and other structures during the procedures. More specifically, the exposure to the HCWs from their waists down result from x-rays coming directly from the tube, as well as reflecting off of the table structure and the bones of the patient. Exposure to the HCWs from their waists up result from X-rays reflecting off of the bones of the patient and structures above the patient. [0005] Most are composed of an x-ray blocking material in the form of a hard, planar shield. These are attached to the ceiling or x-ray table. Some are flexible and some are clear. They are cumbersome, do not conform to the patient&#39;s anatomy (reducing effectiveness in blocking x-rays), do not facilitate surgical access to the body, and do not provide storage for tools or lighting. [0006] Additionally, these shields are heavy and often get in the way of adequate fluoroscopic visualization of the patient or key areas of the patient that require easy access or monitoring. The HCW has to move these heavy shields manually and also conform their bodies to visualize around the impediments caused by the existing devices. This is a major cause for musculoskeletal morbidity of the HCW resulting in chronic neck, back injuries. Consequently, it is common for the HCW to sacrifice radiation protection for better visualization as well as better ergonomics by moving the current shields out of the way or positioning them in a markedly sub-optimal protection position. Finally, it is not uncommon that the HCW forgets to move the shields for adequate protection. [0007] Other x-ray blocking shields have consisted of draping x-ray absorbing material (DXAM) over the patient during procedures. Because these draped materials lay on the patient, they need to be covered with sterile material or be disposed of after every use. This is cumbersome and, as a result, most of the draped material is made as a disposable item (disposable drape and x-ray barrier inside), increasing cost and toxic waste. Moreover, the draped polymer is heavy and uncomfortable for the patient because the patient supports the weight. Additionally, because the DXAM is positioned under the sterile drape that covers the patient, it is difficult to remove during the procedure should an emergency arise that requires more x-ray visualization. [0008] Another problem in protecting personnel from scatter x-ray exposure during medical procedures is that, when the x-ray source is below the patient, the x-ray is scattered off of the patient toward the floor. As a result, the legs and feet of personnel are heavily exposed to ionizing radiation. In addition, the x-ray tube housing can often leak substantial x-radiation, often of high energy. This also increases personnel exposure to high energy ionizing radiation. [0009] Current shielding for \u201cbelow-the-table\u201d radiation consists primarily of a radiation blocking barrier (called the table skirt) that hangs from the table. Since the table height is varied during the procedure, there is often a gap between the floor and the barrier. Additionally, these table skirts are usually hung on a lever arm from the foot end of the x-ray table. They do not cover the gap between the table and the floor from the mid abdomen to the head. As a result, personnel in the room stationed at the patient&#39;s head or side receive substantial radiation exposure. This is a particular risk for physicians performing procedures that require manipulation of catheters near the patient&#39;s head (such as subclavian or jugular vein access, subclavian artery access, or transesophageal ultrasound imaging). OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] There is thus a need for a shielding system that allows a HCW access to a patient while protecting the HCW from radiation. The invention described herein provides several embodiments directed toward providing protection both below and above the waist as well as protecting HCWs located in various positions relative to the patient. [0011] The system of the invention includes a suite of shields and accessories that provide protection and convenience to HCWs working in x-ray imaging environments. The suite includes several components that extend from, or are attachable to a sled that carries a mattress and is attachable to an x-ray table. The radiation protection suite of the invention includes table shields, which extend below the table and protect the HCWs from the waist down. The suite also includes vertical flags that extend upwards and across the body of the patient. The suite further includes body shields, which extend upward from the sled and run along the sides of the patient. Wing shields are also included, which also extend upward along the sides of the patient. The wing shields are generally higher and more rigid than the body shields, providing more protection in high dosage areas. Finally, a tray is provided that extends horizontally across the body of the patient and provides both shielding as well as a work surface for the HCWs. [0012] Mini Sled [0013] In one aspect of the invention a \u201cmini-sled\u201d is provided. In particular, the shielding drape is connected actively or passively to a sled that holds a mattress on which the patient lies during the medical procedure. The sled has a bottom that lays on the x-ray table and two perpendicular sides, typically about 1-4 inches in height. A mattress lies within the U-shaped cavity of the sled. The sled can be the entire length of the mattress or shorter length. The table shield drape is positioned over the sled passively (by gravity) or actively attached. The active attachment can be reversible (such as by a zipper or hook and eye mechanism) or non-reversible (such as with a bonding agent). [0014] In one embodiment, attachment points for arm boards, shields or other devices protrude from the sled through the tray shield and attach to such devices. In the preferred embodiment, the arm boards rotate on the attachments to the sled, such that they can be flush to the sides of the sled in the down position, parallel to the x-ray table in the neutral position, or vertical above the sled in the up position. This allows stowage when transferring a patient off of the bed (down position), support of the patients arms during the procedure (neutral position), or clearance of the x-ray gantry when a lateral view is desired (up position). In addition, in the preferred embodiment, the arm boards pivot outward from the head-ward attachment, allowing the arm to abduct. This feature is important for optimal arm positioning for radial arterial catheterization. [0015] Table Shields [0016] One aspect provided by the invention is a shielding drape, or \u201ctable shield\u201d that extends down from the top of the sled toward the floor. Through experimentation it has been found that an HCW attending tableside to a patient undergoing imaging absorbs significant levels of radiation in their legs and feet that have been historically ignored. Measurements of radiation exposure during use prove that assumptions that the tube housing of the imaging device protects the HCW from radiation exposure are wrong. [0017] A table shield of the invention virtually eliminates below-the-table scatter radiation exposure to personnel. In addition, attachments markedly reduce scatter radiation from the patient&#39;s head, chest, abdomen, and pelvic area. [0018] A table shield of the invention is constructed of a flexible radioabsorbent material such as vinyl fabric, that covers the patient procedure mat and table, where the sides of the material contain radiation blocking material sandwiched within the vinyl material [0019] In one embodiment, the table shield has two or more layers of fabric or other material in the portion that lays across the x-ray table or mattress situated on the x-ray table. Electrical conduction paths between the two layers are used to monitor the patient&#39;s physiologic parameters, deliver therapeutic gasses or electrical power, or control other devices. In one embodiment, a capacitive electrocardiographic system is sandwiched between the two layers, where the leads are situated under the patient and a system for conducting the electrical signal to a detector passes between the layers of the table shield. Similar device sensors or therapeutic devices can be mounted into the space between the shield layers. [0020] In another embodiment, the surface of the table shield is treated to retard the growth of infective agents such as bacteria (using silver impregnation, quanternary ammonium salts, or other agents). In another embodiment, an electrical heating element between the table shield layers can be activated, causing the surface temperature of the other table shield to rise to above 161 degrees Fahrenheit, thereby potentially providing a reduction in the number of infective agents. [0021] The table shield may include vertically-oriented, curved slats or stays that are shaped to cause the drape to curve inwardly and under the x-ray table when hanging passively from the table. The extension of the drape inside the outline of the x-ray table is accomplished by providing a curve in the stays that bow the shield out from the table a small distance and then curve under the table for a shorter distance. This creates a center of gravity of the hanging shield such that the lower portion will passively hang under the table. The inward curve intersects the scatter radiation under the table and prevents radiation from exiting from beyond the outlines of the table, thereby providing more protection without requiring the drape to extend all the way to the operating room floor. [0022] Another aspect of the table shield is that the flexible material is easily moved by the tube when the C-arm swings to oblique angles. Protection is maintained while the stiffening stays prevent the flexible material of the table shield from folding or sagging over the tube and interfering with the imaging beam. This will allow the physician to obtain unobstructed patient fluoroscopy images at various angles without interference from the shielding system. Moreover, the flexible nature of the shield will still provide personnel protection when the shield is pushed upward by the x-ray gantry. [0023] In one aspect, the shielding system rests on the x-ray table, allowing it to move with the patient and provide scatter radiation shielding around the circumference of the patient from the pelvis to the head. This is of particular importance to personnel who must stand near the head or chest. [0024] Other aspects of the table shield of the invention include stays that can be straight or they can consist of articulated components such that the stays passively flex, allowing the shield to bend around the x-ray tube housing but still hold the shielding out of the path of the primary x-ray beam. The stays can be permanently fixed to the flexible material or they can slip into a pre-sewn or formed track within the shield. [0025] Physicians may need to bring the x-ray tube housing and gantry to a position where the beam is directed through the sagittal plane of the patient (often referred to as a \u201ccross-table lateral view\u201d). In this case, the table shield described would cover the x-ray beam. The flexible table shield described may be manually moved out of the way during rotation of the gantry into the cross-table lateral view, allowing it to drop back into a vertical position once the gantry reached the horizontal orientation and cleared the flexible table shield. [0026] In another embodiment, one side of the table shield would be reversibly detachable, allowing the x-ray tube housing to rotate above the x-ray table. In another embodiment, the table shield would only cover a portion of the circumference of the x-ray table. For example, if no personnel were station on the patient&#39;s left side, that side of the shield could be omitted. [0027] Flag Shield [0028] Another aspect of the invention provides a transverse flag shield with an element that attaches the flag to the sled, the patient&#39;s mattress, the table the patient lies on, a free standing device or to a wall or ceiling mount. The attachment mechanism has one or more rigid arms connected at an angle, such that an arm(s) are horizontal and extend from the Attachment mechanism. Below one of the arms is a radiation absorbing material configured in such a way as to conform to the patient&#39;s body. Above the same or another arm is a radio-absorbing material that can be reversibly displaced. For example, an x-ray camera can be positioned such that it passively pushes away only a portion of the upper part of the shield obstructing the camera to allow the camera to be positioned for a particular x-ray view. This passively minimizes the gap in x-ray blockage. [0029] One aspect of the invention provides a flag having elements to conform to patients&#39; body habitus and other elements to flexibly and reversibly deform to accommodate other equipment in the environment of the operating room. Even though the upper unit of the flag shield is partially displaced, the lower functional unit is allowed to remain in place on the patient continuing to block radiation scatter from the patient&#39;s body while the upper unit bends away and conforms to the image intensifier. In addition, the flag shield can mate with the tray shield to seal the gap between the shields and prevent radiation leakage between the devices. In this way, the lower element of the flag shield conforms to the patient, the upper level of the shield conforms to the x-ray equipment movement, and the flag and table shield mate to each other, providing a complete blockage of x-radiation leakage. [0030] The elements of the flag may have vertical supports throughout. The supports contain a hinges or a spring apparatus to allow the flag to bend in the vertical plane. This allows the flag to conform to other radiation absorbing material, such as a tray of the invention, allowing the flag to form a shell around the patient to continue blocking the radiation scatter. Because the flag has elastic properties, when the image intensifier moves away from an interfering position, the flag returns to its initial position, preventing gaps in the shielding where radiation may be emitted towards the HCW. [0031] Another aspect provides a flag with asymmetric curves, which contour to a patient&#39;s body habitus, in the lower functional unit to maximize radiation protection to the HCW. This novel invention contrasts with current devices, which are pushed out of the way by the image intensifier or the HCW to prevent getting in the way of the HCW being able to work with catheters etc. The present invention, conversely, allows the lower portion of the flag to stay in place without moving away and also adds the ability of the upper functional unit to continue to offer radiation protection. This combination minimizes or eliminates the interference to the HCW work flow and allows them to continue their procedure uninterrupted. [0032] The connection between the flag shield and tray shield may be mechanical interference fit, detents, magnetic attraction or other means. [0033] Body Shields [0034] In another embodiment, personnel scatter radiation exposure above the table is attenuated by attachment to the flexible table shield, or to the shield that covers the x-ray table, one or more radiation shields cover various body parts, but particularly the pelvis, chest and shoulder/neck areas. [0035] In one embodiment, rigid or flexible stays within the attached body shields keep the shield in an expanded state while allowing the shield to conform to the body contour. In one embodiment, the stays allow the shield to be folded easily (such as by rolling the shield perpendicular to the stays) and in a further embodiment, magnets within the stays help maintain the shield in a folded position. [0036] Since patient and procedure needs vary, the body shields can be reversibly detachable from the table shield using a variety of mechanisms, such as a zipper or hook and eyelet mechanism. [0037] The body shields may be used instead of, or in addition to, the wing shields. [0038] Wing Shield [0039] Another aspect of the invention, used in conjunction, or independently of, a tray is one or more vertical shields that extend upwardly from the table to a variable height. The shields aid in preventing radiation exposure to the HCW resulting from oblique or horizontal beams coming from deflecting surfaces, such as the patient&#39;s bones, the bottom of the tray, or other equipment, or radiation traveling directly from the tube at oblique angles due to the tube being positioned at oblique angles to the patient. [0040] The invention provides shields designed for placement at various locations relative to the patient. These shields move passively when pushed by the x-ray equipment and then return to their original position when the x-ray equipment moves away. [0041] Side shields, or \u201cwings\u201d attached to the arm board or sled extend vertically along the side of the patient, creating a wall of a desirable height between the HCW and the patient. The wing shields can be displaced passively by x-ray equipment. In one embodiment, the wing shields are attached to the patient arm board using a spring hinge."

  "negative": "The present disclosure pertains to a hydraulic fluid-driven needle-less medication delivery system. The system utilizes a pressurized liquid to expel medicinal substances through the patient's dermal layers without employing any physical needles. The central unit comprises a hydraulic pump, a reservoir, a plunger, and a nozzle designed for efficient drug administration. Previously, typical methods of introducing medication into the body involved penetration using traditional needles, presenting risks of injury and potential for needle-stick infections. The novel advancement lies in its ability to provide a needle-free mechanism, powered by a hydraulic fluid under pressure. A user activates the delivery system by exerting force on a lever, instigating the hydraulic pump to raise the pressure of the fluid within the reservoir. Consequently, the plunger is propelled forward, driving the medicine at a high velocity through the nozzle, allowing it to breach the dermal threshold and enter subdermal regions. The design promises to diminish the discomfort associated with needle usage, and reduce risks related to needle handling and disposal. This technology provides an alternative to the existing needle-based delivery systems, aiming to improve patient experience and safety standards.\n\n",

No. [attorney docket No. 69816-0250782], filed Mar. 14, 2001. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] This invention relates to needle-less injectors, and in particular, modular gas-pressured needle-less injectors and methods of performing needle-less injections using the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Traditionally, fluids such as medications are injected into patients, either subdermally or intradermally, using hypodermic syringe needles. The body of the syringe is filled with the injectable fluid and, once the needle has pierced the patient&#39;s skin, the syringe plunger is depressed so as to expel the injectable fluid out of an opening in the needle. The person performing the injection is usually a trained medical services provider, who manually inserts the hypodermic needle between the layers of a patient&#39;s skin for an intradermal injection, or beneath the skin layers for a subcutaneous injection. [0004] Intradermal or subdermal delivery of a medication through the use of a hypodermic needle requires some skill and training for proper and safe administration. In addition, the traditional method of intradermal injections requires actual physical contact and penetration of a needle through the skin surface of the patient, which can be painful for the patient. Traditional needle injectors, such as hypodermic syringes, are also expensive to produce and difficult to use with prepackaged medication doses. Needle injectors also suffer from increased danger of contamination exposure to health care workers administering the injections, and to the general public when such injectors are not properly disposed of. [0005] Jet injectors are generally designed to avoid some or all of these problems. However, not only are conventional jet injectors cumbersome and awkward, but, existing conventional jet injectors are only capable of subcutaneous delivery of a medication beneath the skin layers of a patient. Conventional jet injectors are also somewhat dangerous to use, since they can be discharged without being placed against the skin surface. With a fluid delivery speed of about 800 feet per second (fps) and higher, a conventional jet injector could injure a person&#39;s eye at a distance of up to 15 feet. In addition, jet injectors that have not been properly sterilized are notorious for creating infections at the injection site. Moreover, if a jet injector is not positioned properly against the injection site, the injection can result in wetting on the skin surface. Problems associated with improper dosage amounts may arise as well, if some portion of the fluid intended for injection remains on the skin surface following an injection, having not been properly injected into and/or through the skin surface. [0006] Typically, needle-less medication injectors use either an expansion spring or a compressed inert gas to propel the fluid medication (via a push rod plunger) through a small orifice (an injector nozzle) which rests perpendicular to and against the injection site. The fluid medication is generally accelerated at a high rate to a speed of between about 800 feet per second (fps) and 1,200 fps (approximately 244 and 366 meters per second, respectively). This causes the fluid to pierce through the skin surface without the use of a needle, resulting in the medication being deposited in a flower pattern under the skin surface. [0007] It should be noted, however, that compression spring propelled jet injectors do not offer linear delivery speeds (constant speed of the fluid being injected). In addition to this problem, spring propelled jet injectors with weak (e.g., deteriorated) springs often slow fluid delivery speed down while an injection is being administered, resulting in improper fluid penetration. Reduced speed of the fluid can cause improper dosing and bruising at the injection site when the injection surface is the skin of a human recipient. [0008] In a jet injector, if the inert gas is not quickly and properly expelled, fluid may be improperly injected, as with those devices employing a compression spring. Conventional disposable needle-less injectors, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,913,699 to Parsons and U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,637 to Newman et al. show a gas-containing, breakable tube that is shattered or cracked open by a side mounted trigger. Difficulties arise in the need to maintain tight tolerances on the breakable member, since minor changes in thickness can dramatically effect the pressure needed to deploy the gas from the gas chamber of the device. In addition, the broken shards of the breakable member are ejected at high speed when the gas is expelled and these shards can occasionally jam between the plunger driver and the housing, thereby preventing proper operation of the needle-less injector. Attempts to prevent small shards from being formed would obviate some of this potential, but tend to make activation of the device more difficult. [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,130, U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,053, U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,198 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,723 describe needle-less injectors incorporating a gas power source, thus obviating some of the limitations inherent in compression spring injectors and addressing many of the concerns of conventional jet injectors. The injectors described therein have a pre-filled and self-contained compressed gas for providing pressure to inject medication into the skin surface of a patient without the use of a needle. [0010] Gas power sources for needle-less injectors that employ either pop valves or breakaway tab valves to release the inert gas stored in their respective gas chambers, however, may only be opened once, thereby presenting difficulty with regard to quality control testing measures. Further, operation of many injectors requires a user to depress a trigger, relying mainly on resistance force from the injection surface to initiate an injection. Where the underlying surface is sensitive, applying such pressure may not be advantageous. Further, if the injection surface is slippery such a device may slide out of place during an injection rendering its use potentially injurious and possibly resulting in improper fluid delivery. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE [0011] It is therefore an object of an embodiment of the instant invention to provide gas-pressured needle-less injectors that obviate, for practical purposes, the above-mentioned limitations. [0012] In one embodiment of the instant invention, a needle-less injector suitable for injecting fluid through an injection surface includes a housing, a trigger, an engine, and a driver. The housing contains a fluid and the engine contains a compressed gas. Upon application of a sufficient amount of force to the trigger, the compressed gas is released from the engine forcing the driver through the interior of the housing, expelling the liquid from the housing at a speed sufficient to pierce an injection surface. [0013] In another embodiment of the instant invention, the needle-less injector includes a mechanism for mitigating the kickback associated with releasing compressed gas from the engine. Grips may be included on the engine, mechanically coupling the engine to an element of the needle-less injector that is affixed to the housing, thereby preventing the engine from separating from the housing upon release of compressed gas from the engine. Also, retainer hooks on the interior of the trigger corresponding to latch retainer mechanisms on the exterior of the housing further prevent the engine from separating from the housing. [0014] In yet another embodiment of the instant invention, the housing of the needle-less injector includes finger rests that provide stability in administering an injection and provide resistance to activate the needle-less injector. Thus, a user need not rely solely on resistance from the injection surface to initiate the administration of an injection. The finger rests may be included on opposing sides of the housing, designed to comfortably receive the fingers of a user without substantial slippage. [0015] In yet another embodiment of the instant invention, the engine of the needle-less injector is fitted with a reusable valve. The valve may contain a rubber head that is held against a fixed element of the engine such that depression of the trigger separates the head from the fixed element, releasing the compressed gas from the engine and, further, forcing the driver to expel liquid from the housing. A spring may be included in the valve to help maintain a proper airtight seal with the canister holding the compressed gas. [0016] In yet another embodiment of the instant invention, a safety clamp is included on the exterior of the housing of the needle-less injector, preventing accidental activation of the device. The safety clamp must be removed prior to use and may be made of a sufficiently elastic material such that a user need only deform the clamp, aided by grips included thereon, to remove the clamp from the housing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0033] As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the invention is embodied in a gas-pressured needle-less injector. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the gas-pressured needle-less injector is pre-loaded with medication and is adapted for a single use. Preferably, the needle-less injector is for use with human beings or other animals. However, it will be recognized that further embodiments of the invention may be used in other applications requiring needle-less injection, such as passing injectable materials through a porous membrane or the like. [0034] Also, embodiments of the present invention may be used to inject other fluids or injectants such as proteins, vitamins, hormones, drugs, vaccines, medications, lyophilized medications, medication cocktails, or the like, and such are contemplated as being within the scope of the term \u201cliquid\u201d as used herein. In preferred embodiments, the liquids used in accordance with the present invention are de-gassed prior to filling into the needle-less injector or are of sufficient chemical properties such that the liquids de-gas immediately upon or soon after filling, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. [attorney docket No. 69816-0250782], filed Mar. 14, 2001. In either of such preferred embodiments, substantially no gas pocket develops in the interior cavity where the liquid resides during storage of the needle-less injector, prior to use. [0035] For ease in describing the various elements of the instant invention, the following spatial coordinate system will apply thereto. As depicted in FIG. 1 c , a central axis is defined through the length of a gas-pressured needle-less injector 100. This central axis 1 has one terminus at the proximate end 2 of the needle-less injector 100 , defined as that end of the device in contact with an injection surface during normal operation of the injector. The other terminus of the central axis is at the distal end 3 of the injector 100 , defined as that end of the device furthest from the injection surface when the injector is positioned perpendicular to the injection surface. Thus, various elements of the device of the instant invention may be described with reference to their respective proximate and distal portions, as well as their central axes. [0036] As depicted in FIG. 1, a gas-pressured needle-less injector 100 includes a housing 201. The housing 201 may be of any suitable shape, though in preferred embodiments it is roughly cylindrical about the central axis. The housing 201 preferably has a varying interior diameter along its length to accommodate the elements that reside and operate therein when the injector 100 is fully assembled. The housing 201 depicted in FIG. 2 a has four such interior diameters: an ampoule diameter 202 , a piston diameter 203 , a diffuser diameter 204 and an engine diameter 205 , respectively. Embodiments of the instant invention preferably do not have an ampoule that is a mechanical element separate and distinct from the housing 201 , yet the housing 201 may act as an ampoule for various purposes such as filling with liquid. [0037] The exterior portion 206 of the proximate end surface of the housing 201 may be flat, though in preferred embodiments it is of a shape that maximizes injector efficacy. Efficacy is optimal when substantially all liquid contained in the injector 100 is delivered through the injection surface, leaving substantially no liquid on either the injection surface or the exterior portion 206 of the proximate end surface of the housing 201 after an injection is complete (see FIGS."

The method comprises adding the lignosulfonate into a dry feed blend before pelletization, ensuring the moisture content does not exceed 15%.

  "pos": "This invention relates to urea-containing pelletized feeds for ruminant animals and the production of such pelletized feeds. More particularly, this invention is directed to increasing the efficiency of production including the rate of production of such feeds, increasing the nonprotein nitrogen content of such feeds and increasing the nonprotein nitrogen (&#34;NPN&#34;) content of such feeds while improving or maintaining the flowability of such feeds when the feeds are subjected to material handling conditions, as when they are subjected to gravitational flow. BACKGROUND A ruminant animal&#39;s nutritional requirements generally are provided by forages, grains and other known feed stuffs. Pelleted feed supplements, however, are commonly used to provide nutritional fortification to the diets of ruminant animals, especially beef cattle in feedlots. These feed supplements generally have an organic component and inorganic component, each of which may form about one half, on a weight basis, of the feed supplement. The primary purpose of the feed supplement is to provide the animal with proteins, vitamins and minerals. The inorganic portion of the feed supplement frequently provides the animal with minerals and the organic portion frequently provides the animal with proteins. Ruminant animals have the capability to utilize NPN as a source of protein by virtue of bacterial conversion of NPN to protein in the stomach of the ruminant. NPN is inexpensive relative to using an organic protein source. Urea is commonly used as a source of NPN in pelleted supplements for ruminants. When pelleted supplements containing urea are stored in vertical bins, however, it is often difficult to remove the supplements from the bin via gravitational flow. Urea-containing supplements tend to &#34;hang-up&#34; in the bin rather than flow freely. Precise mechanisms responsible for this problem are not well understood, but may be related to the hygroscopic nature of urea. A broad variety of measures have been used by both supplement manufacturers and supplement users to attempt to overcome this problem. These measures include minimizing steam addition during pelleting, dusting pellets with a fine, dry powder of calcium carbonate and installation of mechanical agitation equipment in the storage bins. Ruminants such as feedlot cattle require a relatively high level of mineral supplementation in their diets. Hence, pelleted supplements tend to contain a high level of inorganic, particulate ingredients such as calcium carbonate and sodium chloride. These particulate inorganic materials constitute substantially all of the inorganic component of the feed and include mineral ingredients. Pelleted supplements also may include particulates such as urea in the organic portion of the feed. The latter mineral and urea particulates are abrasive and cause a high degree of resistance through a pelletization die. This resistance causes wear on manufacturing equipment and relatively poor production rates. It is desirable to provide a method of increasing the efficiency and the rate production of pelletized feeds for ruminant animals, especially feeds which include a large portion of abrasive particulates such as urea and minerals such as calcium carbonate and sodium chloride. It is desirable to provide a pelletized feed with an increased NPN content utilizing urea and a method for providing such a feed with an increased NPN content. It also is desirable to provide a pelletized feed which includes urea and a method for improving the flowability of urea-containing pelletized feed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a method for increasing efficiency of production and the rate of the production of pelletized dry feed comprising abrasive particulates such as particulate urea and particulate inorganic materials, such as particulate minerals. In this aspect of the invention, the method comprises mixing aqueous ammonium polyphosphate with a dry feed blend which blend includes the abrasive particulates prior to the pelletization of the dry feed blend. The ammonium polyphosphate is mixed with the blend in an amount effective for providing an increase of the rate of production of pelletized feed at least about 3% relative to the production of a feed containing the same amounts of urea and inorganic materials without using ammonium polyphospate. In an important aspect, the invention is effective for increasing production rate of pelletized feed at least about 3% in a feed which has about from about 35 to about 65 weight percent urea and mineral particulate materials, based upon the weight of a prepelletized feed blend. In another important aspect, the ammonium polyphospate is mixed with the dry feed prior to pelletization such that the prepelletized feed contains at least about 0.3 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate. In another important aspect, sufficient ammonium polyphosphate and urea are mixed with the prepelletized feed to provide at least about 6.4 weight percent NPN in the pelletized feed and the amount of ammonium polyphosphate is effective for providing an increase in the rate of production of at least about 3%. The invention in another aspect also provides a method for increasing the NPN content of a pelletized dry feed by balancing the urea and ammonium polyphospate content of the feed such that the pelletized feed has NPN content of at least about 5.6 weight percent and the pelletized feed of the invention has improved gravitational flowability compared to a pelletized feed without ammonium polyphosphate with the same NPN content. In an important aspect, the method comprises mixing ammonium polyphospate and urea with a feed blend to provide a pelletized dry feed having an NPN content of at least about 6.4 weight percent where the ammonium polyphosphate is in an amount effective for providing the pelletized feed with improved flowability compared to a pelletized feed without ammonium polyphosphate with the same NPN content. In yet another aspect, the invention provides a pelletized dry feed comprising ammonium polyphosphate and urea in amounts effective for providing the pelletized feed with an NPN content of at least about 5.6 weight percent, and in an important aspect at least about 6.4 weight percent, the pelletized feed of the invention having improved gravitational flowability compared to a pelletized feed without ammonium polyphosphate with the same NPN content. In an important aspect the prepelletized feed has at least about 0.6 to about 2.4 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate, based upon the weight of the prepelletized feed blend including ammonium polyphosphate, with the remainder of the NPN being supplied by urea. The invention also contemplates a pelletized dry feed with a high NPN content of at least about 8.0 up to about 11.5 or more weight percent where the prepelletized feed blend comprises urea and at least about 0.6 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate, the urea and ammonium polyphosphate being effective for providing the nonprotein nitrogen content of the feed. Further, the invention provides a method for improving the flowability of a pelletized urea-containing feed, the method comprising adding ammonium polyphosphate into the dry feed prior to pelletization in an amount effective for improving the gravitational flowability of the pelletized feed containing the same relative amount of urea, but without ammonium polyphosphate. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Definitions Percentage of NPN means percentage of nonprotein nitrogen and is related to protein equivalents in that approximately 16.0 weight percent of protein is nitrogen. Hence, to get the protein equivalents from the weight percent NPN, multiply weight percent NPN by 6.25. Conversely, if the protein equivalent number is 40, the NPN weight percent is obtained by dividing 40 by 6.25 to indicate a NPN weight percent of 6.4. Flowability means flowability under field material handling conditions using gravity. In the field, feed is moved from container to container using gravity. Hence, material handling using the invention and gravity to move pelletized feed is compared to material handling using gravity without the invention. The percentage of ingredients in the prepelletized feed blend and the pelletized feed are assumed to be about the same. For clarity and consistency with the examples, this specification will sometimes refer to a weight percent based upon the weight of the prepelletized feed, but this percentage should be the same or very close to the percentage amount for the same ingredient in the pelletized feed. Preferred Embodiments This invention has several aspects. The pelletized dry feed supplement has an organic portion and an inorganic portion. The pelletized dry feed supplement is made by mixing aqueous ammonium polyphosphate and a dry feed blend which includes feed grade urea. Prior to the mixing of aqueous ammonium polyphosphate, the dry feed blend generally does not have more than about 15 weight percent moisture, and preferably does not have more than about 10 to 13 weight percent moisture, based upon the weight of the &#34;dry&#34; feed. Generally the feed blend has from about 35 to about 65 weight percent abrasive particulates which include urea and a particulate mineral portion. These particulates make pelletization through a pelletization die difficult. In one aspect of the invention aqueous ammonium polyphospate is mixed into the dry feed blend in amount sufficient to provide a prepelletized feed blend with at least about 0.3 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate based upon the weight of the feed blend which includes the ammonium polyphosphate to increase the rate of production of pelletized feed at least 3%. The amount of ammonium polyphosphate mixed with the feed blend is a function of the ingredients in the blend, especially the amount of particulate inorganic minerals and urea in the blend. The particle size of these abrasive particles vary from powder up to about 1000 microns. Because these materials tend to make extrusion of the pellets difficult, sufficient ammonium polyphosphate should be added to the dry feed blend in an amount effective for increasing the rate of production at least 3%. In an important aspect, sufficient aqueous ammonium polyphosphate is mixed into the feed blend to provide the prepelletized feed blend with from about 0.6 to about 2.4 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate, based upon the total weight of the feed blend, including the aqueous ammonium polyphosphate. This is to provide an increase in the rate of production of the pelletized feed, even with prepelletized feed blends having a abrasive particulate contents as high as 65 weight percent, based upon the total weight of the feed blend including the aqueous ammonium polyphosphate. The dry feed blend has an organic portion which includes: 1. Grains and grain byproducts such as corn, sorghum, wheat, grain screenings, wheat middling, distillers grains, rice bran, and corn gluten feed; 2. Urea as a NPN source; 3. Plant protein products, such as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, sunflower meal, peanut meal, and corn gluten meal; 4. Animal protein products, such as meat and bone meal, blood meal, and feather meal; 5. Roughage products, such as oat hulls, cottonseed hulls and soybean hulls; 6. Animal fat; 7. Vegetable oils; and 8. Vitamin supplements. The dry feed also has an inorganic portion, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, potassium chloride, copper sulfate, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, copper chloride, iron oxide, iron sulfate, manganous oxide, cobalt carbonate, ammonium sulfate, calcium sulfate, monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride, and magnesium oxide. To build NPN content, the feed prepelletized blend will have at least one weight percent feed grade urea up to about 20 weight percent urea based upon the weight of the blend which includes ammonium polyphosphate. Ammonium polyphosphate and urea may be balanced in the feed, as will be discussed to provide an NPN content in the pelletized feed as high as 8 to 11.5 weight percent and above. In another aspect the invention provides a method for increasing the NPN of a pelletized dry feed by balancing the urea and ammonium polyphospate content of the feed such that the NPN content of the pelletized feed is at least about 5.6 weight percent and the pelletized feed of the invention has improved gravitational flowability compared to a pelletized feed without ammonium polyphosphate with the same NPN content. In an important aspect, the method comprises mixing ammonium polyphospate and urea into a dry feed to provide a pelletized dry feed having an NPN content of at least 6.4 weight percent where the ammonium polyphosphate is in an amount effective for providing the pelletized feed with improved gravitational flowability compared to a pelletized feed without ammonium polyphosphate with the same NPN content. In this aspect of the invention the amount of aqueous ammonium polyphosphate mixed with the dry feed blend is an amount effective to provide the feed blend with at least about 0.6 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate, based upon the weight of the prepelletized feed blend including ammonium polyphosphate. In an important aspect the prepelletized feed blend will have at least about 2.0 weight percent ammonium polyphosphate and at least about 11 weight percent urea to provide an NPN content of the pelletized feed of about 6.4 weight percent. The pelletized feed blend is made by mixing the organic portion and inorganic portion including the urea and particulate minerals in a ribbon mixer to achieve homogeneous mixing such as after about one minute in a ribbon mixer. Thereafter the ammonium polyphosphate is sprayed into the blend as an aqueous solution which is commercially available as a solution with 59 weight percent ammonium phosphate and 41 weight percent water. Thereafter, the blend which includes the ammonium polyphosphate is mixed for about 3 to about 5 minutes and is conveyed to a conditioning chamber where steam is introduced into the chamber to achieve a feed or meal conditioning temperature of from about 100 to about 130\u00b0 F. The temperature of the feed at the die should not exceed about 160\u00b0 F. Then, the warmed feed is dropped into a pelletizing die and formed into pellets. Thereafter, the warm pellets drop directly from the pelletmill into a cooler and are cooled using ambient air to within 10 degrees Fahrenheit of ambient temperature. The cooled pellets are then discharged and conveyed to a storage bin for eventual use. The pelletization die usually is a cylinder with a plurality of holes in its curved walls with one or more rollers pushing the feed through the holes in the curved walls. A blade nips the pellets as they exit the holes. A fuller description of known pelletization equipment appears in Feed Manufacturing Technology, American Feed Industry Association, Inc., Arlington, Va., Vol. IV 1994, Ch. 10, pp. 111-130, which is rewritten herein. The following examples illustrate how to practice the invention and make the pelletized feed of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A nutrient constant formula and a standardized formula as shown below are pelletized according to the following procedure. Production data also is shown below. This data shows the significance of the presence of ammonium polyphosphate increasing the production of pelletized urea-containing feed supplement. The formulations were pelletized as follows: 1.) Mixing-- Scott Ribbon Mixer--1/4 Ton Ingredients of each formula are hand scaled into weigh buggy and transferred to the mixer by elevator leg. The ammonium polyphosphate is sprayed onto the feed and the feed is mixed for five minutes. 2.) The mixed feed is conveyed by gravity into elevator leg and transferred to the pelletmill hopper. 3.) Pelletmill-- California Pelletmill--Century Model--50 HP The pelletmill feeder meters the feed into the conditioner. The feed is mixed with steam to achieve the conditioning temperature. The warm feed falls out of the conditioner into the die chamber and is formed into pellets. The pelletmill die is 16 inch diameter, 10/64 pellet hole diameter, with a 2 inch effective thickness, 1/4 inch variable relief. 4.) Cooling--The pellets are transferred by a belt conveyor into a Wenger single pass horizontal cooler. The pellets are cooled by ambient air to within 10 deg F. of the ambient air temperature. The cooled pellets are belt conveyed to the bagging bin.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention relates generally to medical infusion pumps and more particularly to a system and method for remotely controlling a peristaltic pump. [0005] Traditionally infusion pumps have been used to deliver medications and fluids to patients by intravenous subcutaneous or Epidural methods, according to a controlled rate and dose schedule. Such infusion or peristaltic pumps are known in the art. Peristaltic pumps may be linear, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,877,714 (Sorg, et. al), U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,792 (Borsannyi), U.S. Pat. No. 4,893,991 (Canon), rotary, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,431 (Soderquist et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 3,172,367 (Kling) or curvilinear, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,921 (Moubayed et al.). [0006] The pump is normally programmed by a clinician based on a specific patient prescription. The pump is traditionally programmed through a user interface keypad on the pump. [0007] There have been some efforts in the past to establish capabilities of remotely programming the pump through a modem and transferring data through telephone lines. For example, Mediview, which is currently owned by Baxter, provides remote programming capabilities of the Homerun 6060 pump through a modem and telephone line, It allows the clinician to view, at a remote location, the 6060 pump simulated on a computer monitor with its display and keypad. The clinician can view the display of the remote pump on a computer monitor and can interact with the pump using a mouse and keyboard. Remote programming systems, such as those described above may be difficult to program and do not reduce infusion errors. [0008] Thus, there is a need for a system and method for programming a peristaltic pump which reduces prescription programming errors and subsequently infusion errors. The system should also be easy to program, i.e., should not require significant training by the clinician. Preferably, the system and method also provide for clinical assessment and diagnosis of the pump as it is being used for a particular patient. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] An aspect of the present invention may be regarded as a method of storing on a remote storage device protocol information for a drug for administration via a peristaltic pump. The method provides a communications path between the peristaltic pump and the remote storage device. The protocol information for the drug is entered into the peristaltic pump. The protocol information is transferred from the peristaltic pump to the remote storage device. The protocol information for the drug is stored on the remote storage device. [0010] The protocol information may be stored in a drug library on the remote storage device. The protocol information may be selected from the drug library and sent to the peristaltic pump for administration to a patient. The protocol information may be copied from the drug library to a patient library. The protocol information may be exported from the drug library. The exported protocol information may be sent to another user, for example, via e-mail. The exported protocol information may be imported to the drug library. The protocol information in the drug library may be edited. [0011] The protocol information may be stored in a patient library on the remote storage device. The protocol information may be selected from the patient library and sent to the peristaltic pump for administration to a patient. The protocol information may be exported from the patient library. The exported protocol information may be imported to the patient library. The protocol information in the patient library may be edited. [0012] The protocol information for the drug may include associated warnings and precautions. [0013] The remote storage device is a personal computer, such as a laptop computer. The remote storage device may be a handheld storage device, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). [0014] A current date/time and/or maintenance date may be entered. [0015] Pump calibration functions may be invoked. [0016] Another aspect of the present invention may be regarded as a method for receiving history information from a peristaltic pump. A user request is received requesting retrieval of history information from the peristaltic pump. A pump request is formatted to retrieve history information. The pump request to receive history information is transmitted to the peristaltic pump. The history information is received from the peristaltic pump. The history information is displayed. [0017] The history information may be all of the history information stored in the peristaltic pump. The history information may be the latest prescription. The history information may be a predefined amount of history information, e.g., four kilobytes. The history information may be printed or exported for e-mail to others. [0018] Another aspect of the present invention is clinical assessment and diagnostics. History information received from a peristaltic pump may be extracted. The information is extracted in response to a request for information. The requested information is then extracted from the history file. [0019] In exemplary embodiments the requested information may be patient side administration set (line pressure) information or bolus request information. In the case of bolus request information, the extracted information may include bolus requests and medication administered in response to bolus requests. [0020] The extracted information may be displayed, saved to a file, printed and/or transmitted, e.g., via e-mail. Saved files can be renamed. The extracted information may be in a graphical format.

The particular pump shown in the Figures is marketed by Curlin\u2122 Medical of Huntington Beach, Calif. and is described in U.S. Letters Pat. No. 6,164,921, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. However, use of other ambulatory pumps is contemplated herein. Pumps, such as the one shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are typically stand-alone devices used to administer medication to a patient. The pump 10 shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B can be used as a stand-alone pump. Additionally, the pump shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B can communicate with a computer, such as a laptop computer 20 (shown in FIG. 1A) or a handheld computer, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) 30 (shown in FIG. 1B). [0031] The present invention helps reduce the risk of prescription programming errors, and thus medication errors, reduces staff costs by providing time-efficient programming of the pump, facilitates remote monitoring of the infusion process, provides an audit trail for billing, validation and archival purposes, and easily integrates into existing systems. The data management functions allow the clinician the ability to create, select, and use protocols and prescriptions, select and transfer personalized prescriptions to a PDA/Palm\u2122 device, provide a \u201cDrug Precautions\u201d page for warnings, indications and instructions, compile data for further analysis, retrieve patient-history files, and generate customized reports from a PC or Palm device. [0032] Preferably, the computing device 20 is a personal computer (PC) with at least a 486 Intel\u00ae processor with a system speed of at least 90 MHz (megahertz). In preferred embodiments, the computing device 20 uses a Windows\u00ae operating system, such as Windows\u00ae 95, 98, ME, 2000 or NT. The computing device 20 should have at least thirty-two (32) MB (megabytes) of random access memory (RAM) and at least eight (8) MB of available storage space. The computing device 20 preferably includes a compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) drive. Preferably, the computing device 20 includes a graphics card that is capable of a pixel resolution of 800\u00d7600 or better (e.g., super video graphics array (SVGA) or better). In addition to a keyboard, the computing device 20 preferably includes a pointing device, such as a mouse. [0033] The pump shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, like prior art pumps includes logic (software) for managing the pump. [0034] In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the computer 20 stores a drug library and a patient library. The drug library stores protocols classified by drug name, programmer name (person who stored the protocol), and creation date. A prescription or protocol can be selected from those stored in the drug library. The prescription can then be sent to the pump attached to the computer. The protocol is then uploaded to the pump. [0035] [0035]FIG. 2 illustrates an example screen display showing the major functions of one embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, upon starting the program, the user is asked to enter a password. Details in setting up passwords and entering and validating password is not explained in further detail herein as techniques known in the art can be used for security aspects of the present invention including a user login function. [0036] The exemplary screen display 100 shown in FIG. 2 includes controls to access the major functions of the present invention. In the illustrated example, graphical depictions of the function are selected to invoke the various functions. It will be appreciated that other user interface controls, such as menus, could be used to access the functions. The selections available from the main menu shown in FIG. 2 include: Drug Library 102 , Patient Library 104 , Create Prescription 106 , Manage History 108 , Peace of Mind 110 and Single Therapy 112. Each of theses functions is briefly summarized next and described in more detail later. [0037] Pressing the Drug Library button 102 invokes the drug library function which allows the user to store and access protocols. Pressing the Patient Library button 102 invokes the patient library function which allows the user to store and access (e.g., copy and export) patient specific prescriptions.

Pressing the Manage History button 106 invokes the manage history function which allows the user to download the pump history for archiving, documentation, review or analysis. Pressing the Peace of Mind button 108 invokes the peace of mind function which downloads a recently programmed therapy for documentation, validation or verification. Pressing the Single Therapy button 110 invokes the single therapy function which converts the pump into a PCA, TPN, continuous, intermittent, or variable therapy only pump for manual programming. [0038] If the user presses the Drug Library button 102 , an exemplary Drug Library Display 120 such as the one shown in FIG. 3 is displayed so that the user can view or edit information for the prescription that was entered during create Rx. In the example shown, there is a list of stored protocols 122 which are identified by a drug name, programmer and creation date. One of the stored protocols can be selected. Detailed information is then shown for the selected protocol. The detailed information includes comments 124 and drug precautions 126. The display includes controls, such as buttons, that allow the user to manipulate the data in the drug library. [0039] In the exemplary embodiment, the user can press a Copy button 130 which allows the user to copy a protocol from the drug library to the patient library. When the copy button 130 is pressed, a window is displayed prompting for a patient&#39;s name. Entry and acceptance of a valid patient name causes the selected protocol to be copied to the patient library and stored under the entered patient&#39;s name. [0040] Pressing an Import button 132 allows the user to import a protocol. This allows the user to store appropriately formatted files into the drug library. The files may be sent by another user. [0041] Pressing an Export button 134 allows the user to export a selected protocol. The user can export the protocol to another user. In exemplary embodiments, the protocol is exported by sending it to the desired user via e-mail. [0042] Pressing an Edit button 136 allows the user to edit an existing protocol. In exemplary embodiments, selection of the edit function causes two additional controls, e.g., buttons, to be displayed, namely, Delete and Save.

This file is then transferred to the Palm\u2122 device. In exemplary embodiments, if there is an existing Patient.pdb file, it will be written over by the new file. Thus, the user must transfer all desired protocols to the Palm\u2122 device as the previous protocols in an existing Patient.pdb file will be overwritten. [0045] If the user presses the Patient Library button 104 , a patient library display 160 is displayed.

The exemplary screen display shown in FIG. 5 provides the user with an instruction window 182 which tells the user to: (1) connect and turn on the pump; (2) select library and fill in fields; and (3) program the pump. [0047] A cable is used to connect the pump, for example, Curlin\u2122 Medical 4000 CMS pump 10 is connected to the PC 20 , by inserting the cable in the serial port of the PC. The user selects the desired library 184 , i.e., the drug library or the patient library, for storing the protocol to be uploaded from the pump.

  "negative": "The technology relates to an innovation in hemodynamic support devices specifically designed for ventricular insertion to regulate blood movement within a patient's heart, which consequently improves output metrics. The system features an anchoring unit adapted to be affixed near the heart's apical region with a connected pump made up of a tubular enclosure that accommodates both entry and exit points. This design includes a mechanism for propelling a rotor located within the enclosure alongside a uniquely adjustable component that influences the outgoing blood trajectory. Overcoming the limitations of inotropic agents, the innovative design enables the support of diminished ventricular action without the adverse outcomes linked to continuous flow methods. The system exhibits a pump that can be non-surgically loaded into the cardiac space without requiring substantial chest opening procedures. Additionally, it presents a feedback loop that harmonizes circulatory demands, residual ventricular power, and pump operation. The device aims to improve blood movement during the ejection phase of the cardiovascular cycle and adjusts flow within the ventricle towards the arterial valve. Instead of extracting blood from the ventricle consistently and redirecting it towards the artery directly, this design simply aids the cardiac organ in its intrinsic functionality. Unlike other systems, this device does not interact or overlap with the aortic structure, maintaining its role as in a non-assisted, healthy state. Additionally, it does not yield a continuous flow but instead offers a pulsatile flow. The proposed device focuses on implantation within the apical cardiac region and optimally is established as an axial-flow pump generating a flow induction to attract supplemental blood from the ventricle downstream to improve efficacy. Moreover, the end part of the pump enclosure is designed to allow directional alteration of the outgoing blood flow to optimize trajectories and to mitigate the risk of cardiac tissue injury related to powerful jets. Alteration of the blood outflow orientation from the pump is achievable in the implanted condition. The orientation is modulated using a control module, potentially employing a real-time blood flow monitoring method, and the modifications can be made automatically for maximum therapeutic efficacy. The pump may include a magnetic link for coupling a propelling unit, specifically a rotary propeller, to the rotor, offering a non-contact and non-wearing motion transfer method. The power source could be electrical or powered by pneumatic forces, with possible configurations allowing placement either partially or entirely outside of the cardiac region. The operational parameters of the pump could be tuned to the patient's level of physical activity and assistance requirement, with control units adjusting rotational speeds based on various physiological signs.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD [0001] The invention refers to a ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement to accelerate blood flow inside a human heart thereby enhancing the ejecting volume, comprising an anchor element configured to be mounted to the heart in the region of the apex and a pump connected to the anchor element and comprising a preferably tubular housing having an inlet and an outlet and further comprising a drive for driving a rotor arranged within the housing and a special adjustable nozzle directing the ejecting blood flow. BACKGROUND [0002] Left ventricular contractility normally accelerates blood within the left ventricle and ejects as an average 70% of the blood volume contained in the left ventricle into the circulatory system. In case of severe heart failure this mechanism is insufficient and the majority of the blood volume remains within the ventricle, thus producing inadequate cardiac output. [0003] Several systems are known to correct cardiac failure bypassing the left ventricle and continuously ejecting the blood from the left ventricle via an artificial conduit directly into the great thoracic arteries. Such systems operate as left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in order to help the heart&#39;s weakened left ventricle pump blood throughout the body. [0004] The LVAD can be used as a bridge-to-transplant, which means it can help a patient survive until a donor heart becomes available for transplant. This option may be appropriate for people whose medical therapy has failed acutely and/or who are hospitalized with end-stage systolic heart failure. The LVAD also can be used as destination therapy, which is an alternative to heart transplantation. Destination therapy provides long-term support in patients who are not candidates for transplant, because of severe comorbidities and especially of older age. When used as a bridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy, the LVAD provides effective chronic hemodynamic support, maintains or improves other organ function, improves exercise performance and enables participation in cardiac rehabilitation. [0005] These assist devices comprise a continuous flow pump, which produces a continuous, non-pulsatile flow of blood through the circulatory system using a rotary pumping mechanism. There is, however, a multitude of side effects on end organs as well as major cardiac surgery for implantation. Recently several minimal invasive forms of cardiac assist devices have been developed. WO 2009/099644 A1 discloses a ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement inside a human heart. It comprises a pump that is implanted within the left ventricle with the outflow cannula projecting through the aortic valve and terminating short of the aortic arch. The pump is fixed to the wall of the heart near the apex by means of an anchor element in order to hold the pump and the outflow cannula in position. The device disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1 produces a continuous flow of blood, wherein the aortic valve is penetrated by the outflow cannula and is therefore unable to close effectively, but cooperates with the pump traversing it in order to prevent retrograde flow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. Because of the continuous character of the flow the valve is held in only one position, which increases the risk of valve thrombosis and/or significant retrograde leakage into the failing and assisted ventricle. [0006] The drawback of the device disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1 and of other continuous flow ventricular assist devices is that\u2014since they have to maintain up to 100% of cardiac output\u2014they are disturbing normal end organ function and contractile pattern of the diseased heart, leaving nutritive coronary blood flow unchanged and therefore limit structural recovery. SUMMARY [0007] Therefore, it is an object of the instant invention to provide an improved ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement inside a human heart. In particular, it is an object of the invention to optimize blood flow and support residual contractility without the severe side effects of continuous flow as mentioned above. In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide an implant that does not involve the risk of impairing the remaining contractile force of the failing ventricle. [0008] Further, it is an object of the invention to avoid the drawbacks associated with LVAD systems having extraventricular conduits. In available LVAD systems with external conduits the aortic valve remains closed, because all ejecting blood is bypassed. Therefore, the system is limited only to patients without a structural insufficient aortic valve. [0009] It is a further object of the invention to provide an assist device that can be easily deployed to the heart without a sternotomy. [0010] It is a further object of the invention to provide a closed loop between the circulatory demand, the remaining force of the diseased ventricle and the supporting pump. [0011] The words \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201cdistal\u201d are used herein to denote directions and ends of the device in relation to blood flow. As used herein, when referring to the ventricular assist device, the term \u201cproximal\u201d refers also to the directions toward the physiologic blood flow and surgeon or other operating room personnel during installation of the device and the term \u201cdistal\u201d has the opposite meaning. [0012] The invention generally provides an improved ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement (inside a human heart) providing pulsatile flow acceleration in the left ventricle, preferably during systole. Preferably, the pulsatile flow acceleration is synchronized with the heartbeat. [0013] In some embodiments, the invention provides ventricular assist device comprising an anchor element configured to be mounted to the heart in the region of the apex and a pump connected to the anchor element and comprising a preferably tubular housing having an inlet and an outlet, said inlet and said outlet being arranged within the ventricle, and further comprising a drive for driving a rotor arranged within the housing. Preferably, the drive is an electric or pneumatic motor. [0014] In some embodiments, in order to provide pulsatile flow acceleration during systole, the invention provides a control unit connected with the drive for controlling the pump, said control unit comprising a first sensor for sensing a heartbeat of the heart and configured to control the pump to be driven in a pulsatile manner in synchronization with the heartbeats. [0015] The invention is based on the idea to correct left ventricular failure by increasing the velocity of the blood column during the ejecting period of the heart (i.e. during cardiac systole) and redirecting blood flow within the ventricle towards the aortic valve. Normally, blood entering the left ventricle via the mitral valve swirls in a vortex near the apex and gets accelerated during the ejection period. In case of heart failure the heart does not provide enough acceleration of ventricular blood flow, thereby forming a second vortex in the mid cavity without producing sufficient force to eject blood. The inventive device assists the heart by providing a flow accelerator within the ventricle. Thus, the inventive approach uses a different pathophysiologic concept than disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1. Instead of sucking the blood out of the ventricle continuously and directly delivering the pumped blood to the aorta, the invention just assists the heart in its natural way of functioning. [0016] Further, the invention does neither traverse nor bridge the aortic valve, but uses the aortic valve as in an unassisted, healthy heart. [0017] Further, the device does not provide continuous blood flow, but pulsatile blood flow. Pulsatile flow is a flow with periodic variations, like the flow in the cardiovascular system. By synchronizing the pulsatile flow provided by the pump of the assist device with the heartbeat, the periodic variations of the flow produced by the assist device preferably are substantially in phase with the periodic variations of the flow in the cardiovascular system, in particular at the beginning of the aorta. [0018] Preferably, the assist device produces a pulsatile flow by causing alternating phases of no pumping action and of pumping action. Alternatively, the assist device produces a pulsatile flow by causing alternating phases of low pumping action and of enforced pumping action. Thus, the control unit of the assist device is configured to alternately turn on and turn off the pump in order to produce periodic variations of the blood flow within the pump housing. Preferably, the pumping action is triggered only during the early phase of systole until peak pressures are reached within the aorta. Preferably the pump action is initiated by applying a ramp function thereby accelerating the rotor and then leaves the rotor fading out according to the blood volume sensed in the heart at late diastole. [0019] The assist device of the invention is configured to be implanted into the apical region of the heart. [0020] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pump is configured as an axial-flow pump in order to pump blood from the inlet of the pump housing to the outlet. [0021] In order to increase the effect of flow acceleration within the ventricle, the device is preferably configured to additionally operate as an injector so as to entrain blood from within the ventricle downstream of said pump rotor, namely entraining blood that is outside of and preferably distal to the pump housing. Preferably, the injector effect of the assist device is achieved by the blood flow produced by the rotor between the inlet and the outlet of the pump housing, which blood flow entrains additional blood from within the ventricle to the aortic valve. In order to allow for said entraining of additional blood, the pump housing preferably comprises at least one additional inlet opening downstream of the rotor. [0022] The injector effect of the pump may preferably also be achieved by beveling the outlet opening of the pump housing so as to obtain an end face that is inclined relative to the axis of the pump. [0023] Preferably, the flow cross-section of the pump continuously decreases in a flow direction at the outflow end of the pump housing so as to form a nozzle. Preferably, the nozzle is able to direct the flow towards the aortic valve and to entrain surrounding blood by sucking it into the nozzle through at least one lateral opening. The nozzle enhances the injector effect of the pump. [0024] Preferably, the nozzle comprises guide plates extending in the axial direction of the pump so as to redirect rotating blood flow exiting the impeller to induce an axially directed laminar blood flow. [0025] Preferably, the end region of the pump housing, downstream of the rotor, is configured to allow for an adjustment of the outflow direction of the pumped blood. In particular, the end region of the pump housing may be flexible to optimize the flow direction towards the outflow of the heart so as to prevent jet-induced lesions on the myocardium. In this way, the flow of blood exiting the pump housing via the outlet opening can be directed to the aortic valve and then fixed in the adjusted position. Preferably, the adjustment of the outflow direction of the pump is feasible in the implanted state of the device. [0026] Preferably, the adjustable end region of the pump housing cooperates with an actuator in order to adjust the outflow direction of the pump. The actuator may be realized by an electric motor and may be positioned outside of the heart. When positioned outside of the heart, the actuator is preferably connected to the adjustable end region of the pump housing by means of suitable connecting means, such as a steering wire. The adjusting movement of the adjustable end region of the pump housing as induced by the actuator is preferably controlled under the guidance of a blood flow monitoring technique. Preferably, the actuator is controlled by a continuous flow sensor incorporated into the adjustable end region so as to position the adjustable end region of the pump housing into the optimal position within the outflow tract. Periodic monitoring of the orientation of the adjustable end region of the housing is advantageous for an optimal ejection of blood from the failing heart into the aorta, since the heart remodels during therapy. [0027] Preferably, the outflow orientation of the pump is adjusted automatically, by using a control algorithm, in particular a closed loop controller. Preferably, the outflow direction of the pump is controlled as a function of the blood flow speed measured in the vicinity of the outflow end of the pump. The blood flow speed is indicative of whether the blood flow is directed to the aortic valve or whether the blood flow induced by the pump is reflected at the heart wall surrounding the aortic valve or into the inflow region. The flow speed may be measured by means of an ultrasonic Doppler sensor that is mounted at the outflow end of the pump. Preferably, the further parameters to be considered in the control algorithm are at least one of hemodynamic variables such as hemodynamic pressure, pump speed, energy consumption and hemodynamic pressure. [0028] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump comprises a magnetic coupling for coupling a drive, in particular a rotary drive, to the rotor. The magnetic coupling provides a non-contact and wearless transmission of the rotary motion of the drive to the rotor. Further, the magnetic coupling facilitates the removal of the drive and the mounting of a new drive if needed. [0029] Preferably, the drive is an electric motor. Alternatively, the drive may be configured as a pneumatic drive, so that the rotor of the pump is driven by pneumatic force. Preferably, the pneumatic drive is located outside the heart, wherein the magnetic coupling allows a complete separation between the drive and the pump rotor. In this embodiment the pneumatic energy is delivered by a percutaneous tube connected with a pneumatic source delivering pulsed volume flows into the turbine positioned outside of the heart, which is magnetically coupled to the blood pumping impeller. [0030] Preferably, the drive is at least partially arranged proximally of the anchor element so as to be placed at least partially outside of the heart when in use. In particular, the entire drive is arranged outside of the heart when in use. In case of an electric motor, this helps to keep away the heat generated by the electric motor from the ventricle and the blood contained therein so as to reduce the risk of a thrombosis. [0031] Alternatively, the motor may be positioned intraventricularly. Preferably, the pump rotor may be directly coupled to the rotor of the electric motor, wherein the rotor is supported within the motor by means of a contactless magnetic bearing. In this way, the magnetic bearing provides for an annular clearance between the rotor and the stator of the electric motor, the clearance establishing a flow cross-section for the blood pumped by the pump rotor. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,570. [0032] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump output of the pump, i.e. the rotational speed of the pump rotor, and/or the activation time period of the pump are adjusted depending on the patient&#39;s level of activity and need of support. Preferably, the control unit is configured to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of heart rate signals derived from the first sensor. In particular, the rotational speed of the pump rotor is increased with increasing heart rate in order to compensate for the reduction of the ejection period. [0033] Further, the rotational speed of the pump rotor is decreased with decreasing heart rate. [0034] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump output of the pump is varied over a heartbeat cycle, such that a maximum pump output is reached during the systolic period, wherein a lower output is adjusted in order to augment the pressure during diastole when needed to facilitate coronary inflow. Preferably, a second sensor is needed to control the driving speed of the pump rotor to avoid cavitation within the heart, so that the pump accelerates only the equivalent volume portion needed in order to achieve normal ventricular ejection. [0035] Alternatively or additionally, the control unit may comprise at least a further sensor for sensing a blood pressure, a cardiac output, a blood flow velocity, a derivative of the blood pressure and/or a pulse wave velocity and is configured to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of the signals derived from the further sensor. The blood pressure sensor may preferably be configured as a noninvasive blood pressure measuring device, in particular as a device operating according to continuous noninvasive techniques. The pulse wave velocity is preferably measured by a method for continuous pulse wave monitoring, such as identifying a time difference between a signal derived from the ECG and the corresponding signal measured at the patient&#39;s arm or other extremity by a non-invasive blood pressure measuring method. [0036] Preferably, the control unit comprises a memory for storing at least one characteristic curve representing a set value for a blood pressure as a function of the heart rate. The control unit may in this case be configured to calculate a pressure difference between a blood pressure derived from the further sensor and a set value for the blood pressure derived from the characteristic curve and to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of said pressure difference. [0037] Adapting the activation time period of the pump may be used in order to adjust the ejection time of the diseased heart to that of a healthy heart. This may alter the ejection and heart rate relationship according to the values registered by the further sensor(s). [0038] As mentioned above, the further sensor may be configured to sense the cardiac output. In order to sense the cardiac output, the further sensor may be configured to measure the volume of the heart cavity, such as a sensor arranged for measuring the impedance across the heart. In particular, the ratio of the diastolic volume of the heart to the systolic volume of the heart per heartbeat or unit of time may be used in order to calculate cardiac output. The control unit may use the data representing cardiac output as sensed by the further sensor in order to adapt the rotational speed of the pump rotor in a close loop control."

  "pos": "PRIORITY CLAIMS This application is a Continuation of International Application No. PCT/CH00/00390, filed on Jul. 18, 2000, which claims priority to German Application No. DE 199 39 023 A1, filed on Aug. 18, 1999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The invention relates to a device for administering an injectable product. 2. Description of the Related Art Injection devices, for example injection syringes or injection pens, such as the invention relates to in particular though not exclusively, conventionally comprise a casing which accommodates an ampoule with the product to be injected, a delivering means for delivering the product out of the ampoule and a coupling means. The delivering means is conventionally formed by a piston which is movable in the ampoule. In simple syringes, the muscular power of the user serves as the drive means. The use of spring elements, in particular pressure springs, as the drive means is also known. The coupling means forms a transmission link or drive connection from the drive means to the delivering means. The known drive means, for example drive springs, have the disadvantage that the drive force or drive energy applied by them is subject to changes in the course of being released. In drive springs, the drive energy changes in accordance with the spring characteristic. The delivering rate of the delivering means follows such changes. Correspondingly, the delivery rate changes in the course of delivery in accordance with the changing drive energy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a device for administering an injectable product, with which the product is evenly delivered in the course of an injection or infusion. The invention is based on a device for administering an injectable product which includes a casing, a container for the product accommodated by the casing, a delivering means, a drive means and a transmission link or coupling means. The product is delivered directly out of the container by the delivering means. The drive means supplies the drive energy required for this, said drive energy being transmitted in the transmission link to the delivering means, in such a way that the delivering means is driven by the drive means, to deliver the product. The container, the delivering means, the drive means and the transmission members of the transmission link are preferably arranged in the casing. Other arrangements are, however, in principle equally possible. The injectable product is preferably a medical or cosmetic agent, in particular in the form of a liquid active solution. A prominent example is insulin, administered using the device within the context of a treatment for diabetes. The device is preferably an infusion device. It can, however, also be an injection device. The container can, in particular, be formed as an ampoule, as is the case in known infusion devices. The delivering means is preferably formed by a piston accommodated by the container, which is advanced towards an outlet of the container, to deliver the product. However, instead of such a piston, the delivering means can in principle be formed by any type of pump suitable for delivering the product. According to its type, the drive means is preferably formed in such a way that it releases the energy stored in it when it is triggered. Via a coupling means, this released energy is transmitted in the transmission link to the delivering means which, driven for its part in this way, delivers the product out of the container. The drive means is preferably formed by a drive spring, particularly preferably a pressure spring. In principle, however, other designs of drive means may also be used, e.g. those which release a pressure gas when triggered. According to the invention, a fluid space for an incompressible fluid and a pressure reducing means are provided in the transmission link from the drive means to the delivering means, i.e. in the coupling means. The fluid space correspondingly comprises a drive side, upon which the drive means acts, and a driven side, which acts on the delivering means. Both the drive side and the driven side can be connected, directly or via other transmission members, to the drive means and/or delivering means respectively. The fluid space can be impinged on its drive side by pressure from the drive means. The pressure thus generated is reduced toward the driven side of the fluid space by the pressure reducing means. The pressure is preferably reduced to a fifth or less and particularly preferably to a tenth or less by means of the pressure reducing means. The pressure reducing means creates a fluid connection which only allows a delayed flow of the fluid from the drive side towards the driven side, such that in a dynamic state, i.e. while the delivering means is being driven, a greater fluid pressure prevails on the drive side than on the driven side. The invention enables a drive means to be used in which substantially more energy is stored than would be required to drive the delivering means and the resulting delivery of the product. The comparatively large drive energy released when the drive means is triggered is attenuated by the fluid coupling in accordance with the invention onto the measure required for delivering and administering. The excess of drive energy is available, controlled due to the fluid coupling in accordance with the invention, for driving the delivering means. If a drive spring is used as the drive means, as is preferred, then the spring strength of this drive means can be significantly higher than in the case of a direct drive connection to the delivering means. In particular, such a drive spring can be operated in a smaller range of its spring characteristic than would be possible in the case of a direct coupling. Particularly preferably, a working stroke of the drive means is transmitted into a working stroke of the delivering means by the fluid coupling, said working stroke of the delivering means being greater than the working stroke of the drive means. In the case of a pressure or tension spring as the drive means and a piston as the delivering means, the respective working stroke is the stretching or straining of the spring and the distance covered by the piston in dependence on this working stroke. Particularly preferably, the delivering means is formed as a piston and the drive means likewise acts on a piston, designated in the following as a drive piston. In this embodiment, the drive side of the fluid space is formed by a piston area of the drive piston. The piston area of the drive piston is preferably larger than a piston area of a driven piston, wherein the piston area of the driven piston forms the driven side of the fluid space. Through this ratio of the two piston areas, a stroke of the drive piston is transmitted into a comparatively larger stroke of the driven piston. Expressed differently, a smaller stroke of the drive piston is required to achieve a given stroke of the driven piston. The working stroke of the drive piston can be kept correspondingly short. The drive means can be operated in a tight range around its optimal operating point. Furthermore, the different-sized piston areas lead to a reduction of force. The force exerted by the drive piston is reduced in accordance with the ratio of the areas of the drive piston and driven piston. This reduction occurs in addition to the reduction of force as a result of the reduction of pressure. The Applicant reserves the right to independently further prosecute the feature of the different-sized piston areas, together with features a) to e) of claim 1. The driven piston can form the delivering means directly. The driven piston is, however, preferably another piston. In a particularly preferred example embodiment, the fluid space is sub-divided into a first partial space including the drive side and a second partial space including the driven side, and the two partial spaces are connected to each other exclusively by a system of capillaries, if a higher pressure prevails on the drive side than on the driven side of the fluid space. The system of capillaries can be formed by a single capillary or also by a plurality of capillaries. The capillary or plurality of capillaries is/are advantageously as long as possible. Its/their length is preferably at least 0.5 m. If a plurality of capillaries are formed, this preferably applies to each of the capillaries. The through-flow rate in long capillaries is less dependent on the diameter of the capillary, as directly follows from the Hagen-Poiseuille Law. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille Law, variations in the diameter due to imprecision in production enter into the through-flow rate in the fourth power. However, with an increasing length of the capillary, its diameter can likewise be enlarged, if the through-flow rate is to remain constant. Larger diameters are on the one hand by their very nature simpler to produce than smaller diameters, and with an increasing size of the diameter, deviations from the desired diameter arise to an increasingly less important extent only. Furthermore, an as high viscosity of the working fluid as possible in the fluid space is preferred. The system of capillaries preferably comprises a capillary running spirally, or a plurality of such capillaries. In a preferred example embodiment, the system of capillaries is formed by a single, spiral capillary. A spiral capillary not only has the advantage of a large length, but can also be simply produced. In particular, it can be formed in the form of an external or internal thread on a corresponding surface area, preferably a shell or jacket surface area, of a capillary body. The capillary body with the external or internal thread is preferably placed into or onto another body with a smooth opposite surface area, wherein care must be taken that the threads of the capillary body are sealed against each other on the opposite surface area. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will now be described by way of a preferred example embodiment. There is shown: FIG. 1 an infusion device in a longitudinal section; FIG. 2 a capillary in accordance with Detail I of FIG. 1; and FIG. 3 an alternative embodiment of a capillary. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 shows a longitudinal section of an infusion device. A circular cylindrical outer sleeve 3 , together with a sealing piece 9 at a proximal end and a sealing cap 19 at a distal end, forms a casing of the infusion device. A container holder 4 a is held centered in a proximal region of the outer sleeve 3. A container 1 in the form of an ampoule is accommodated by the container holder 4 a , likewise centered with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the outer sleeve 3. The container 1 is filled with a product to be injected, for example insulin. A delivering means 2 in the form of a delivering piston is furthermore movably accommodated by the container, in a straight line toward an outlet of the container 1. A catheter 20 is connected to the outlet of the container 1 in a manner known in its own right. An inner sleeve 4 b is arranged in a distal region of the infusion device, concentric with respect to the outer sleeve 3. In the example embodiment, the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b are formed as a one-piece sleeve. The container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b could also be separate components. However, forming them as one piece simplifies holding them commonly centered in the outer sleeve 3 , as can be directly inferred from FIG. 1 and the subsequent description. An inner surface area of the inner sleeve 4 b forms a slide bearing for a driven piston 6 accommodated by the inner sleeve 4 b , said driven piston being connected rigidly to the delivering piston 2 by means of a piston rod 7. The driven piston 6 and the piston rod 7 are formed as one piece. The piston rod 7 abuts the delivering piston 2. It could also be firmly connected to the delivering piston 2 ; for example, it could be screwed to the delivering piston 2. Furthermore, the piston rod 7 can equally be guided into a collar region between the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b , for example guided fluid-proof. The driven piston 6 seals toward the inner sleeve 4 b using sealing rings 17 in the manner of piston rings. A ring space is formed between the outer sleeve 3 and the inner sleeve 4 b , a drive piston 5 being arranged in said ring space. The drive piston 5 is a ring piston which is slid back and forth, fluid-proof and tight, between the outer sleeve 3 and the inner sleeve 4 b. Sealing rings 15 are accommodated by grooves in an inner surface area of the drive piston 5 and other sealing rings 16 are accommodated by grooves on an outer surface area of the drive piston 5 , each in the manner of piston rings. The drive piston 5 comprises a plane ring area on a distal front face. The drive piston 5 tapers toward the inner sleeve 4 b in the proximal direction. The taper is formed by means of a collar. An opposite area of the infusion device lies opposite the collar, seen in the proximal direction. The opposite area is formed by a distance piece in the form of a distance ring 9 a , which surrounds the container holder 4 a and lies loose on the sealing piece 9. In a ring space between the outer sleeve 3 on the one hand and the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b on the other, a pressure spring 8 is accommodated between the two opposing areas, i.e. the collar of the drive piston 5 and the distance ring 9 a , abutting the two areas. By varying the strength of the distance ring 9 a , i.e. by exchanging it, the device can be simply adapted to different pressure springs 8 , to continuously set the operative range of the spring optimally. A capillary body 10 is arranged behind the drive piston 5 in the distal direction. The capillary body 10 comprises a proximal ring region and is occluded by a base at its distal end. In the region of its ring body, the capillary body 10 is sealed fluid-proof against the outer sleeve 3 and preferably also against the inner sleeve 4 b. A distal front area of the inner sleeve 4 b pushes fluid-proof against the base of the capillary body 10 via a sealing ring 18. The capillary body 10 is provided with a aperture opening 14 in the region of a distal opening on the front face of the inner sleeve 4 b which is sealed by the sealing ring 18. An aperture open in one direction only is formed in the capillary body 10 by a reflux valve. The reflux valve comprises a valve ball 11 which is pressed into its fitting within the capillary body 10 in a known way by means of a valve spring 12. The valve spring 12 is in turn supported on a valve closure 13. A fluid space is formed between the distal front area of the drive piston 5 and a distal front area of the driven piston 6 , said fluid space being occluded fluid-proof by said two pistons 5 and 6 and comprising a first partial space 21 and a second partial space 22. The two partial spaces 21 and 22 are separated from each other by the capillary body 10. The fluid space 21 , 22 is completely filled with an incompressible working fluid. A highly viscous oil is preferably used as the working fluid. The reflux valve 11 , 12 , 13 only allows a through-flow of the working fluid from the partial space 22 into the partial space 21 , and prevents a through-flow in the other direction. The capillary body 10 , together with an inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3 surrounding the capillary body, forms a fluid connection in the form of a system of capillaries. The system of capillaries is shown in Detail I of FIG. 2. It is formed by a single, connected fluid channel, namely a capillary 23. The capillary 23 , in the form of a multiple thread, encircles the outer surface area of the capillary body 10 in a spiral. In principle, the capillary 23 can also be formed by a single thread. When the capillary body 10 is installed, the capillary 23 connects the two partial fluid spaces 21 and 22. The inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3 opposite the capillary 23 is simply smooth. The capillary body 10 is guided into the outer sleeve 3 by a slight pressing power. When installed, the \u201cteeth\u201d on the outer surface area of the capillary body 10 , which separate the individual threads of the capillary 23 from each other, press fluid-proof against the inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3. The teeth of the capillary body 10 are flattened for sealing purposes. The capillary body 10 consists of a softer material than the outer sleeve 3 , in order to improve sealing. For the same purpose, however, the outer sleeve 3 could also in principle be made of a softer material than the capillary body 10. An alternative embodiment of a capillary 23 is shown in FIG. 3. In this case, the capillary 23 is formed in one insert as a straight fluid channel. The insert is held fluid-proof in a receptacle of the capillary body."

  "negative": "The discussed technology pertains generally to intravascular instruments and techniques, specifically focusing on stenotic blockage-modifying catheters for application in the cardiovascular system. The forefront of the invention illustrates strategies for dealing with arterial complications. These endoluminal strategies, comprising vessel-rerouting balloons, often employ tension-dissemination structures that may effectively remodel the internal surfaces of occluded or narrow passages in the cardiovascular system. Expert operators often utilize such angioplasty procedures to create a reduction in vessel constriction, diminish trauma to vascular structures, and consequently enhance surgical outcomes relative to conventional angioplasty methods. Tension elements within these balloons implement distinct features such as protrusions or incisions that interact with vessel obstructions. However, the potential for damage to delicate vessels or the balloon apparatus itself during navigation and operation remains a concern. Associated risks include possible disruption to nearby healthy tissues while the balloon is advanced or retracted from the cardiovascular system. Technologies with covered tension elements within folding expansible tubes are known but may not safeguard delicate membranes effectively during the installation of such tension elements or throughout navigational manipulations within intricate vessel systems. Prior to the present filing, various documents, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,686,824; 7,799,043; and 7,691,080, were reviewed. The innovation seeks to surmount these challenges by introducing a configuration of blockage-modifying components that engage with occluded vessel regions, breaking down rigid obstructions and calcific deposits through the generation of localized micro-fractures. Additional aims include fabricating an accessible catheter framework endowed with a series of blockage-modifying components that project from an expandable balloon, thus achieving ease of use, straightforward manufacturing, and cost-effectiveness. A catheter system aspect of the innovation encompasses an expandable appendage coupled with blockage-modifying entities that transform both the superficial and deeper attributes of stenotic tissues at a point of treatment within a patient's vasculature. A catheter assembly within the scope of this description possesses a longitudinal balloon capable of expansion. This balloon derives its inflated shape from a condensed form through various intermediary forms to a completely dilated configuration. In specific designs, the ensemble of blockage-modifying elements comprises durable bases that interact with occlusions upon balloon expansion, potentially shaped in varying geometric patterns using a stiffened polymer. The array of these elements might be longitudinal on the balloon's periphery, and upon the full expansion of the balloon, at least some components project, ready to alleviate hardened tissue obstructions. The balloon may carry external mounting segments that affix the components to its surface. A plausible design for the blockage-modifying balloon system includes flexible sheaths to shield the circulatory pathway from the operational features of the blockage-modifying entities while the catheter traverses to and from the intended area. The proposed catheter system comprises an expandable unit that facilitates a clinician's performance of vascular corrective procedures. The catheter, furnished with a deflatable balloon, is inserted via a minimal incision into the vascular pathway, targeting vasculopathies. The catheter setup is designed to cater to various obstructions within diverse blood vessels without being restricted to certain arteries but being universally applicable throughout human vascular and ductal frameworks. These systems might include internal channels and be initially sheathed to protect against unintentional contact while navigating the patient's vascular network. Upon reaching the lesion, the sheath can retreat to allow the contact of the blockage-altering components with the blockage. Expanding the balloon thrusts these components outward, optimizing their interaction with the tissue. The detailed workings of the invention do not restrict its form to the disclosed embodiments and proportions, which serve illustrative purposes. Consequently, this specification must not confine the invention's various possible manifest configurations. The depicted apparatus signifies a section of an intravascular instrument prepared for treating an obstruction, emphasizing the innovative arrangement of blockage-modifying elements. In the figures provided, the accessible endpoint of the instrument portrays explicit reference numerals corresponding to similar components, thus supporting an impactful treatment method.\n\n",
  "pos": "The invention pertains generally to endovascular devices and methods and more particularly to plaque-modifying balloon catheters for treating vessels in the arterial vasculature. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures can treat arterial disease. In such endovascular procedures, cutting balloons are sometimes considered as a treatment option for opening blocked coronary and peripheral vessels. Such balloons are sometimes configured so that balloon pressure is communicated to one or more cutting elements. Those elements may selectively cut stenosed vessel walls. In the hands of a skilled interventionist, PTA atherectomy procedures have sometimes reduced vessel recoil, lessened vessel tears and may have improved outcomes in comparison to traditional PTCA procedures. Severing elements used in such balloons can for analysis be said to include an effective surface feature (e.g., an edge) that is capable of incising or scoring vessel walls with which they come into contact. But if suitable precautions are not taken, the incising elements can tear, cut or perforate the thin, fragile inflation balloon during assembly, handling or use. It is also possible that an unintended balloon rupture could damage the arterial wall. This may result in loss of inflation fluid into the patient&#39;s vasculature. Another problem may arise if an inadvertent or unwanted cutting occurs of adjacent perhaps healthy tissue as the cutting balloon is being positioned or withdrawn from the vasculature. (2) Description of Related Art A device with a cutting edge which is covered within the pleats of an expandable clover leaf-shaped tube is disclosed by Shiber in U.S. Publication No. US 2002/0151924. However, such designs may fail to protect a fragile balloon during installation of the cutting edges, even before the device is used in situ. In addition, because the blades are situated within the balloon folds, creased portions of the balloon may be exposed to the blades when the device is navigated by twisting, turning and bending through narrow tortuous vasculature passageways. The following references, among others, were considered before filing this application: U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,686,824; 7,799,043; and 7,691,080. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Against this background, it would be advantageous to provide an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that are urged into contact with stenosed vessel walls and weaken those hardened portions as well as calcific plaques by creating and propagating localized fissures. Yet other desires include providing a catheter system with an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that extend from an inflatable balloon which is easy to use by surgeons of varying skill levels, is straightforward to make and is comparatively cost-effective. One aspect of the invention focuses on a plaque-modifying catheter system that includes an inflatable balloon which is provided with plaque-modifying elements that alter the surface and sub-surface characteristics of stenotic tissue at a treatment site in a vessel of a patient. For discussion and analysis, an embodiment of a catheter system falling within the scope of the present disclosure has an elongated balloon that defines a longitudinal axis. The balloon is inflatable from a first deflated configuration through intermediate second configurations to a third radially expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the balloon includes one or more stiff pedestals or footpads (\u201cplaque-modifying elements\u201d) that are brought into contact with plaque on vessel walls during inflation. For example, the pedestals could be considered as a punch or tool with a head that is circular, rounded (\u201cdomed\u201d), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like. Its constituent material may include a hardened polymer. In some embodiments, the array of plaque-modifying elements is oriented longitudinally and mounted on the outside of the inflatable balloon. When the inflatable balloon is in the radially expanded configuration, at least some of the pedestals are urged outwardly radially by the inflatable balloon so that they are capable of fracturing hardened tissue (soft plaque, as well as calcific plaques). The balloon may further include on its outer surface one or more mounting pads that secure the pedestals to the balloons. For example, some of the pedestals may extend from an associated mounting pad that is affixed to the outer surface of the inflatable balloon. Optionally, the plaque-modifying balloon system includes one or more sheaths that are made of a relatively low durometer, flexible material. Functionally, if used, each sheath protects the vasculature from an operative surface feature of a plaque-modifying element during transit of the balloon to and from the treatment site. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS The novel features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, both as to its structure and its operation, will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar reference characters refer to similar parts, and in which: FIG. 1 is a simplified, longitudinal cross sectional schematic view of a catheter system having an array of plaque-modifying elements operatively positioned in the body of a patient; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the catheter system (without a covering sheath); FIG. 3 is perspective partially sectioned view of the embodiment of a plaque-modifying balloon system depicted in FIG. 2 ; FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the balloon system of FIGS. 1-3 shown after the balloon has been inflated to urge plaque-modifying elements radially outwardly before sheath removal; FIG. 5 illustrates method steps that exemplify how the catheter system is used. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. Referring initially to FIG. 1 , a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 is shown with an expansible balloon 12 that supports plaque-modifying elements 32. The system 10 enables a surgeon to perform an endovascular procedure in which a catheter with a deflated balloon surrounding it is inserted percutaneously into a blood vessel (e.g., a femoral artery) to treat vascular disease. More specifically, the catheter system 10 is depicted as being positioned to treat a lesion 14 in an artery 16 such as but not limited to a coronary, renal, popliteal or femoral artery, the aorta or other artery. But those skilled in the art will recognize that the use of the catheter system 10 as herein described is not limited to treatment of a specific artery. Instead it can be deployed in vascular conduits and other ductal systems throughout the human body. In FIGS. 1-4 , there is depicted one embodiment of a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 with an open inner lumen 18. In that embodiment, the system 10 has a catheter (tube) 20 with a proximal end 22 and a distal end 24. As used herein, \u201cproximal\u201d is used in relation to the surgeon. The inner lumen 18 extends between the proximal 22 and distal 24 ends so that a medical device or fluid may pass through the lumen 18 without interruption or interference. If desired, the disclosed invention could be used as a blood perfusion balloon catheter such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,617. Such catheters can be used in administering treatments to relieve stenotic regions within a body lumen while maintaining blood flow past the dilation balloons. Perfusion ports in one example can be provided in both a guide wire lumen and in a bypass lumen in order to provide increased blood flow. Abstract, &#39;617 patent. Thus, the plaque-modifying balloon 12 includes an expandable balloon 26 ( FIG. 4 ) that is located proximate to and circumscribes at least the distal end region 22 of the catheter 20. The expandable balloon 26 encapsulates a pressurizing fluid (such as a saline solution or nitrous oxide) in a chamber 28 formed between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26 , which causes the balloon 26 to inflate. The balloon 26 has an outer surface 30 which may optionally at least partially have a dry coating. The pressurizing fluid is delivered by means for pressurizing, maintaining and deflating the chamber 28 formed between the catheter and the balloon (such as a pump in communication with an activator for imparting a rapid rise in pressure). An assembly of plaque-modifying elements 32 is mounted on at least a part of the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Without being bound to any theory of operation, the modifying elements 32 are thought to break collagen and distend elastin in the intima and media of a vessel wall 16 , thereby weakening the intima and media and superimposing (by, for example \u201cstamping\u201d or \u201cembossing\u201d or \u201cfracturing\u201d) a pattern of weakened areas in the vessel wall 16. Such weakened areas may allow the vessel wall 16 to become more flexible, to bend and to distend radially. In one treatment protocol, it is envisioned that the step of pressurizing the balloon is completed in about 1-5 seconds and the step of depressurizing the balloon is completed in a similar time. Optionally the step of contacting the balloon with a vessel wall to be treated is completed over a dwell time of about 1-5 minutes or longer if desired. In one embodiment, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are supported from a base 34 extending from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Extending outwardly from the base 34 is a shaft 36. A plaque-modifying tip 38 is situated atop the shaft 36. The plaque-modifying tip 38 has a cross section geometry selected from the group consisting of a polygon, an oval, a circle, a dome, an ellipse, an \u201cx\u201d shape, a star shape and a \u201cy\u201d shape. In an embodiment, optionally, a retractable sheath 40 at least partially covers the modifying elements 32 as the catheter system 10 is maneuvered through a tortuous vasculature. The sheath 40 can be retracted to expose at least a part of the plaque-modifying assembly 32 when the assembly 32 is juxtaposed with a site to be treated. If desired, the sheath 40 can be repositioned to cover the plaque-modifying assembly 32 before the catheter system 10 is withdrawn. Not shown in communication with the balloon 26 are one or more conventional fluid ports for pressurization and relief of the chamber 28 between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26. It will be appreciated that the proximal portion 22 of the catheter 20 is connected to the distal end 26 of an inflation mechanism or the means for inflation 42 ( FIG. 1 ). Typically, the inflatable balloon 26 is made of a polymeric material such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or nylon and its outside diameter is about 6-8 French. As best seen in FIG. 4 , the inflatable balloon 26 can be thought of as having an outer surface 30 and an opposed inner surface 46 that surrounds an inflation volume or chamber 28 that can be infused with a medical grade fluid to expand the inflatable balloon 26. It will be appreciated that an inflation device 42 (not shown) may include a syringe that can be activated to pump the medical grade fluid (such as a saline solution) to expand the inflatable balloon 26. In FIGS. 1-4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 may assume various alternative forms. These include tips 38 that are circular, rounded (\u201cdomed\u201d), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like in a variety of configurations, e.g., an array of longitudinally or laterally spaced or aligned sets, as shown in FIGS. 2-3. As seen in FIG. 4 , in one embodiment, the modifying elements 32 are distributed around the circumference 30 of an operative section of the inflatable balloon 26. Typically, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are made of a medical grade material such as a hard plastic like polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). As best seen in FIG. 4 , a portion of at least some of the modifying elements 32 extend from associated mounting pads or bases 34 that are secured to an outside surface 30 of the balloon 26. Typically, each mounting pad 34 is made of a relatively flexible polymeric material such as polyurethane and is bonded (e.g. heat bonded or adhesively bonded) to the outer surface 30 of the inflatable balloon 12. It can further be seen that each element 32 extends from its associated mounting pad 34 to an operative tip 38 that is capable of modifying the plaque with which it is urged into contact upon balloon inflation. The process is analogous to fracturing the plaque and causing a modified surface that in some cases may resemble the fractured windshield of an automobile. It can be further seen that the tip 38 of each plaque-modifying element 32 extends in a radial direction (\u201cheight\u201d) which on average amounts to a distance \u201cX\u201d from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. The rise and fall (\u201cpulse\u201d) during balloon compression and decompression occurs over an average distance \u201cx\u201d. For the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 are preferably bonded to the inflatable balloon 26. This structure limits the amount of a given element that can sink into ambient plaque, by analogy to a depth gauge. Regardless of whether a sheath is deployed, it is sometimes preferable that the plaque modifying elements 32 closer to the distal end 24 of the balloon 26 are closer to the balloon surface elements 32 that lie closer to the proximal end 22 of the balloon 12 to facilitate insertion of the catheter system 10 into the vasculature. In alternate embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements 32 are not too tightly located and are spaced apart. In some embodiments the average spacing between adjacent elements is at least 3 times the height of the tip above the outer surface of the balloon. This geometry permits navigation of the catheter system 10 around abrupt turns in the vasculature without adjacent elements 32 interfering with each other. The plaque-modifying elements are optionally aligned in longitudinally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. In some embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements are aligned in laterally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. Alternatively, the plaque-modifying elements are staggered so that an element in a row lies longitudinally between adjacent elements in a neighboring lateral row. The functionality of one sheath embodiment 40 can be appreciated with reference to FIG. 4. As shown, the optional sheath 40 , if deployed, protects the effective tips 38 of plaque-modifying elements 32 during transit of the balloon 26 and plaque-modifying elements 32 to the treatment site. After the system 10 is positioned at the treatment site and before the balloon 26 is expanded, the sheath 40 (if present) is withdrawn. The plaque-modifying elements 32 make their first contact with the tissue 14 (see FIG. 1 ). Once contact has been established between the tissue 14 and the plaque-modifying elements 32 , further pressurization over a short period of time of the inflatable balloon 26 causes the elements 32 to pulse outwardly radially for tissue modification. Plaque modification arises from localized weakening by fracture of for example calcified areas. Not only does fracture engender fissure formation (thereby weakening the fissured area), but it also reduces the stiffness of plaque-lined vessel walls while augmenting the surface area over which chemical reaction occurs if a pharmaceutically effective drug is delivered thereto. If desired, pressure can be applied quickly once, like a single hammer blow to a sheet of ice. Alternatively, pressure can be administered pulsatingly, like a jack hammer. Optionally the means for pressurizing 42 includes a control mechanism that allows the surgeon to administer either or both modes of pressure application. FIG. 5 illustrates a series of method steps that can be followed in practicing one aspect of the disclosed endovascular protocol. The steps include: A. Prepare a catheter subassembly. This step involves connecting a catheter which is covered at least partially somewhere but not necessarily completely between its intermediate region and distal end by an expansible balloon to an external source of fluid pressure. The source may optionally be provided with a pulsating means so that balloon expansion can be controlled and (if desired) affected rapidly, thereby creating a pulsating or hammer-like impact to a stenosed region. Optionally, pressure could be increased more slowly and stopped. B. Optionally cover the catheter subassembly with a sheath to form a catheter assembly. When used, the sheath protects potentially healthy vessel walls from abrasion by unprotected plaque-modifying elements. C. Insert the assembly into the vasculature. One insertion site is the femoral artery, although other sites may be used. Following insertion, the assembly is carefully pushed along the tortuous vascular passageways until it is juxtaposed with an anatomical site to be treated. D. If present, the sheath may then be removed, thereby exposing the plaque-modifying elements. E. The balloon is then expanded by the application of fluid pressure. If used, a saline solution or nitrous oxide, for example, can be first used to flood a chamber between the outside of the catheter and the inside of the balloon, thereby expanding it. If desired, a shockwave can be propagated through the relatively incompressible fluid so that a punching effect on the stenosed vessel wall can be created by rapidly moving plaque-modifying elements. Optionally: 1. pharmaceutical agent may be delivered by microchannels extending through the plaque-modifying elements to the stenosed region either before or after fracture; or 2. the drug may be bonded to the balloon wall and by contiguity eluted into the vessel (e.g., Paclitaxel is lipophilic and rapidly reacts within 60 seconds with the vessel wall). F. The balloon may then be deflated by evacuating the pressurizing fluid before the deflated balloon is covered with the sheath."

  "query": "What methods exist to create biodegradable artificial red cells that can transport oxygen and are impermeable to hemoglobin?,",
  "negative": "The present inquiry pertains to biocompatible red cell analogues. Specifically, this pertains to red cell analogues comprising microdroplets of protein solution encapsulated within membranes of polymerized protein which allow diffusion of gases yet retain the protein molecules. The quest for red cell replacements has been motivated by limitations in the utilization of preserved blood. A critical issue is the unavailability of suitable preserved blood during emergencies. Further, the short shelf-life of preserved red cells constrains the feasibility of stockpiling. While the protein component of cells remains stable under appropriate storage conditions, the cell membranes degrade over time. Moreover, the risk of disease transmission through transfusions poses another concern, especially when the medical situation is not critical. Thus, a necessity for viable cell replacements is evident. The main role of these replacements would be to sustain systemic circulation of a harmless solution to the human physiology that carries gases for a duration sufficient for natural hematopoiesis. Prior efforts in the domain include the development of oxygen transport emulsions which, despite their promise, were hampered by several issues when administered to patients. The encapsulation of protein solution, particularly those demonstrably safe in humans, in durable carriers presents a promising direction. Nevertheless, challenges persist in ensuring that these carriers exhibit appropriate gas release characteristics and remain in circulation for adequate periods. These efforts include encapsulating the protein solution employing various polymeric substances, resulting in constructs that resist normal metabolic degradation. Alternatively, certain patents describe preparations made by cross-linking protein solution free of cellular debris into high-molecular-weight aggregates. However, these aggregates differ from the envisioned red cell analogues since they lack a fluid-filled membrane to facilitate reversible gas binding. In further developments, encapsulation in lipids has been proposed to create red cell analogues, but lipid membranes may release their internal components into host cells. Techniques for fortifying existing cell membranes have been disclosed as well, albeit these membranes themselves contribute to the storage and compatibility complications associated with preserved blood. Therefore, a demand exists for red cell analogues that encapsulate a protein solution without cellular debris, of suitable dimensions, resilience, and elasticity, making them suitable for use as cell replacements. This invention encompasses red cell analogues of a protein solution free from cellular fragments encased within membranes of cross-linked, polymerized protein solution without cellular fragments. The diameters of these analogues are maintained under 8 micrometers, preferably under 4 micrometers, preserving their integrity under physiological shear stress. They may also include other beneficial components such as therapeutic agents. Preparatory processes may involve emulsification, reaction with linking agents, and recovery of the red cell analogues. However, encapsulation can be of any cross-linkable protein material, with a broad size range. The flexibility and deformability of these analogues can be modulated by osmotic interactions with surrounding fluids. A detailed protocol elaborates on the selection and separation of protein solution, and the use of cross-linking agents that engage with protein functional groups. Illustrative cross-linking agents are discussed extensively, along with a generic method employing a liquid membrane encapsulation technique. This involves emulsification, incubation with cross-linking agents, phase separation, and retrieval of the resultant red cell analogues.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to artificial red cells. More particularly, this invention relates to artificial red cells composed of microdroplets of hemoglobin solution encapsulated in membranes of polymerized hemoglobin which are permeable to oxygen and impermeable to hemoglobin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The search for blood substitutes has been prompted by many serious drawbacks to the use of donor blood. One of the most serious problems relates to the fact that an adequate supply of compatible donor blood may not be available at the time and place where it is needed. This would be a particularly serious problem during periods of disaster or war when blood is most needed. The incompatibility of different blood types and the relatively short storage life of whole blood limits the practicability of collecting and storing large amounts of whole blood. According to some estimates, as much as 30% of human blood collected is not reinfused into human patients. Although red blood cells have a relatively short storage life which contributes to a large amount of wasted blood, the hemoglobin contained in the red cells appears to be unaffected if stored under the proper conditions. However, the red cell membranes tend to degrade in storage. Further, the transmission of disease, especially hepatitis, is a problem that makes physicians hesitant to transfuse whole blood or plasma into patients under conditions that are not life-threatening to the patient. Thus, there is a definite need for effective blood substitutes. The primary function of a plasma expander or blood substitute is to maintain an adequate circulation volume of a solution that is nontoxic to the human body and which will transport oxygen throughout the body to sustain life until the body can remanufacture a supply of natural blood. Artificial blood substitutes have received considerable attention during the last decade. The development of fluorochemical emulsions that transport oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood stream offered hope of a viable blood substitute. Unfortunately, however, a number of problems have limited the use of fluorochemical emulsions in human patients. Aqueous hemoglobin solution is the main constituent of red blood cells and is the blood&#39;s oxygen carrier. It has also been demonstrated to be safe when used in human patients. However, its intravascular persistance and oxygen-release characteristics have proven to be inadequate. Free hemoglobin completely disappears from the blood stream in less than about eight hours and its affinity for oxygen is much greater than that of an equivalent amount of hemoglobin encapsulated within the natural red-blood-cell membrane. This greater affinity makes liberation of oxygen to the tissues much more difficult. It is the red-blood-cell membrane that contains the antigenic material which causes problems when mismatching of donor and recipient occurs. Problems of intravascular coagulation and renal damage have been demonstrated to be caused by the stroma present in such membranes and not the hemoglobin molecule itself. Thus, the use of stroma-free hemoglobin solution (SFHS) as a blood substitute offers many potential advantages regarding immunology, storage and bio-compatibility. Also, since free hemoglobin is not toxic to the kidney, SFHS seems an ideal starting material for a blood substitute. A number of attempts have been made using standard encapsulated techniques employing various polymeric materials such as celluloses, polystyrenes and polyamides to create artificial red cells by encapsulating hemoglobin therein. However, these standard encapsulation techniques have produced red cells non-biodegradable by ordinary metabolism. Alternatively, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,001,401; 4,053,590; and 4,061,736 disclose blood substitutes and plasma expanders comprising polymerized, cross-linked, stroma-free hemoglobin in either the oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin form, said polymers having a molecular weight ranging from about 64,000 to 1,000,000. These blood substitutes are prepared by cross-linking stroma-free hemoglobin in bulk solution with a suitable cross-linking agent that is at least bifunctional in nature. However, the hemoglobin polymers are not artificial red cells, because they are merely polymeric molecules as such and do not consist of a membrane encapsulating a fluid phase which can reversibly combine with oxygen. In another attempt at creating artificial red cells, Miller et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,874 disclose forming artificial red cells by encapsulating hemoglobin in liquid lipid materials comprising phospholipids, and optionally cholesterol, to form cells typically ranging from 0.1 to 10 microns in their greatest dimension. The lipid material is said to form a continuous membrane around the hemoglobin solution. However, phospholipids have a tendency to release their contents into other cells in the body. Kitajima et al in U.S. Pat. No. 3,879,510 show reinforcing the naturally-occurring membrane around red blood cells by reacting the membrane with an isocyanate such as toluene diisocyanate. In reinforcing the naturally occurring membrane, red blood cells are dispersed in a suitable isotonic or hypertonic saline solution to which is added an oil-in-water emulsion of liquid polyisocyanate which reacts with the membranes, thereby reinforcing same. However, it is the red blood cell membranes which contain materials that cause short storage life, and incompatibility problems between different blood types. Thus, there is a need for artificial red cells comprising an encapsulated, stroma-free hemoglobin solution of a suitable size, strength and flexibility to permit same to be used effectively as blood substitutes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to artificial red cells of stroma-free, aqueous hemoglobin solution encapsulated in membranes of cross-linked, polymerized, stroma-free hemoglobin that is permeable to oxygen and impermeable to hemoglobin. These artificial red cells can be prepared having diameters of less than 8 microns in their greatest dimension, preferably less than 4 microns and are able to maintain their individual integrity under conditions of flow with shear rates of up to about 2\u00d710 5 sec -1. If desired, they may consist essentially of a stroma-free, aqueous hemoglobin solution encapsulated in cross-linked hemoglobin, thus consisting essentially of stroma-free hemoglobin and minute amounts of crosslinking agent. Alternatively, other ingredients such as drugs, nutrients, hormones, enzymes and antibodies may be incorporated into the hemoglobin solution prior to the encapsulation thereof. These artificial red cells may be prepared by emulsifying stroma-free hemoglobin solution, as microdroplets, in an oil phase, reacting a suitable cross-linking agent with the hemoglobin at the surface of the microdroplets of emulsified hemoglobin solutions thereby forming a suspension of artificial red cells in the oil and then recovering the artificial red cells. It should be understood however, that the scope of this invention also extends to encapsulating any cross-linkable proteinaceous material, in which case the cell size may broadly range from about 0.1 to 100 microns. Further, the artificial red cells or microdroplets of encapsulated proteinaceous material of this invention may be made flexible and easily deformable in nature simply by contacting them with an aqueous solution to which the encapsulated hemoglobin solution or solution of proteinaceous material is hypotonic. Thus, contacting same with an aqueous solution with respect to which the hemoglobin or proteinaceous material solution is hypotonic causes some of the water in the encapsulated solution to osmotically diffuse through the membrane into the aqueous solution which depletes the interior of the artificial red cell or microdroplet of encapsulated proteinaceous material of a portion of its contents, thus rendering the cell flexible and readily deformed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Hemoglobin solution useful for the artificial red cells of this invention is prepared by starting with red blood cells separated from freshly drawn human blood, from outdated whole blood, packed red cells obtained from human donor centers or from red blood cells obtained from animal blood such as bovine blood. There are many known ways to prepare stroma-free hemoglobin. In one particular method, whole blood is drawn into bottles containing an anticoagulant, centrifuged and the supernatent plasma withdrawn. Next, the resultant red cells are washed in about 1 to 4 volumes of cold, isotonic or hypertonic sodium chloride solution to form a suspension of red cells which is then centrifuged and the supernatant removed and discarded. The red cells are generally washed an additional two to three times with the wash being discarded after each centrifugation. Procedures for preparing stroma-free hemoglobin solution (SFHS ivolve hemolysis, centrifugation, filtration and, optionally, dialysis. To obtain stroma-free hemoglobin, the red blood cells are first lysed in about one to four volumes of cold water or other lysing solutions such as hypotonic phosphate buffers or hypotonic saline. After lysing, the red cell suspension is shaken and cold toluene is added at about 10-200 volume percent of the red cells, usually about 10-30 volume percent. This mixture is then shaken for four to ten minutes and left standing at from 4\u00b0 C. to 6\u00b0 C. for 24 to 72 hours to produce a triphasic mixture. A lower, clearer, red layer is isolated and centrifuged at about 40,000 to 50,000 g for at least 60 minutes at about 4\u00b0 C. to 6\u00b0 C. Then, the upper supernatant is separated and filtered through a suitable filter such as a diatomaceous earth filter. If desired, residual low molecular weight salts and metabolites may be removed from the stroma-free hemoglobin by dialysis against standard or medically acceptable buffers which are well known to those in the art. The method used to prepare SFHS to demonstrate the instant invention is set forth in Example 6 supra. Suitable cross-linking agents include those which are at least bifunctional and, for the case where one desires to form artificial red cells, those which result in a cross-linked hemoglobin membrane which is biodegradable in a mammalian body so that the cells can be eliminated from the body after their function has been performed. The bi or poly-functional cross-linking agents must have at least two functional groups which can be the same or different. These groups must be capable of reacting with and cross-linking the functional groups of the proteinaceous material which, in the case of hemoglobin, are primarily amino groups. By amino groups is meant the N-terminal alpha amino group of the hemoglobin chains and those of the basic amino acid residues such as lysine and arginine. The following are intended to be illustrative, but non-limiting examples of various categories of suitable cross-linking agents. The functional groups of the cross-linking agent can be covalently bonded to each other or they can be separated by an aliphatic or by an aromatic ring. Exemplary aromatic stabilized functional groups are azo and halo activated with a nitro group. These include compounds having a heterocyclic ring with reactive groups bonded to the ring. For example, triazines of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R 1 is halogen including fluoro, chloro and bromo, and R 2 is a nucleophilic substitute such as an aliphatic or aromatic group, a halogen, a lower alkyl of 1 to 8 carbons, and amino. Cross-linking agents embraced by this formula are 2-amino-4,6-dichloro-s-triazine and chloro-s-triazine. The cross-linking agents include aromatic stabilized agents prepared by the diazotation of an aromatic diamine, for example, benzidine and its derivatives with nitrous acid to yield bis-diazobenzidines of the formula: ##STR2## wherein R 3 is a member selected from the group consisting of a covalent bond, alkylene of 1 to 5 carbons, phenylene, ether, sulfone and secamine, R 4 is halogen or nitro.

The agents also include compounds having a functional group bound to an aromatic moiety either directly or through an alkylene bridge of the formula R 10 --(CH 2 ) m --C 6 H 4 --(CH 2 ) m --R 10 wherein R 10 is the same or different and m is 0 to 3. Cross-linking agents include the compounds having the functional groups bonded to a cycloalkyl as represented by the formula: ##STR4## wherein R 10 is the same or different, p is 0 to 4, and q is 1 to 4. The cross-linking agents include compounds having functional groups bonded to an aliphatic chain interrupted with a nonfunctional group or having nonfunctional groups bonded to the chain as represented by compounds of the formula R 10 --(CH 2 ) x --R 11 --(CH 2 ) x --R 10 wherein R 10 is the same or different, R 11 is selected from the group consisting of an ether bridge, a divalent amine and a sulfone, and x is an alkylene of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, which each x the same or different. Representative of the functional group embraced by R 10 include isocyanate, vinyl, imine, isothiocyanate, isocyanide, aldehyde, epoxide, chloroformate, thiochloroformate, and imido lower alkyl ester, and thiolactones of the formula: ##STR5## wherein a is 1 to 3. Also, R 10 can be an activated group formed by reacting the carboxylic acid with a thionyl halide or phosphorus halide, or an activated group formed by reacting an amide or an alkyl ester of the carboxylic acid with hydrazine and then with nitrous acid to yield the corresponding activated group COR 12 wherein R 12 is halogen or azide. The activated group can also be formed by reacting the carboxylic acid with N,N&#39;-carbonyl diimidazole or a carbodiimide of the formula R 13 --N\u2550C\u2550N--R 13 wherein R 13 is the same or different and are a lower alkyl, a lower cycloalkyl, di(lower)alkyl amino lower alkylene, and heterocyclic lower alkyl including morpholino ethyl.

Representative of compounds bearing a functional isocyanate or isothiocyanate group are the compounds listed below. Additionally, the isocyanates or isothiocyanates can be synthesized by reacting an alkyl or aryl amine with phosgene or thiophosgene. The isocyanates used for crosslinking are diisocyanates and they react with the free amino groups of hemoglobin producing urea or thiourea cross-linking sites. Typical compounds include diphenyl-4,4&#39;-diisothiocyanate-2,2&#39;-disulfonic acid, toluene diisocyanate, toluene-2-isocyanate-4-isothiocyanate, 3-methoxydiphenylmethane-4-4&#39;-diisocyanate, propylene diisocyanate, butylene diisocyanate, and hexamethylene diisocyanate.

Other cross-linking agents include derivatives of carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid residues of hemoglobin activated in situ to give a reactive derivative of hemoglobin that will cross-link with the amines of another hemoglobin. Typical carboxylic acids useful for this purpose have the formula COhd 2H(CH 2 ) n CO 2 H, and {(CH 2 ) n COOH} 3 CH wherein n is 1 to 8. The carboxylic acids include citric, malonic, adipic and succinic. Carboxylic acid activators include thionyl chloride, carbodiimides, N-ethyl-5-phenyl-isoxazolium-3&#39;-sulphonate (Woodward&#39;s reagent K), N,N&#39;-carbonyldiimidazole, N-t-butyl-5-methylisoxazolium perchlorate (Woodward&#39;s reagent L), 1-ethyl-3-dimethyl aminopropylcarbodiimide, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholino-ethyl) carbodiimide, metho-p-toluene sulfonate.

The above functional reagents or methods for preparing them are reported in Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr., Vol. 12, pages 4615 to 4617, 1971; Biochemical Aspects of Reactions on Solid Supports, by Stark, George R., Chapter 1, published by Academic Press, 1971; Chemtech, pages 47 to 55, 1974; Rev. Pure and Appl. Chem. Vol. 21, pages 83 to 113, 1971; and British Pat. No. 1,252,770. One method of preparing the artificial red cells of this invention is by the use of a liquid membrane encapsulation technique. In this method, the stroma-free hemoglobin is emulsified in a surfactant-containing oil to form discrete, red-cell-size microdroplets of hemoglobin in a continuous oil phase. In general, this process comprises the steps of: (a) emulsifying a stroma-free, aqueous hemoglobin solution in a surfactant-containing oil to form an emulsion comprising discrete microdroplets of said hemoglobin solution in a continuous hase of said oil; (b) forming, in an aqueous suspending phase, liquid membrane capsules comprising globules of said emulsion formed in (a), said globules comprising an aqueous interior phase of discrete microdroplets of hemoglobin solution and an exterior oil phase immiscible with both said aqueous interior phase and said suspending phase and wherein said suspending phase contains a water soluble cross-linking agent capable of polymerizing hemoglobin; (c) forming artificial red cells suspended in said globules of oil phase by maintaining said capsules in said suspending phase for a time sufficient for said crosslinking agent to polymerize hemoglobin at the surface of said hemoglobin solution microdroplets present in said capsule to form an artificial membrane around each of said microdroplets of hemoglobin solution; (d) separating said suspending phase from said oil phase containing the artificial red cells; and (e) recovering the artificial red cells from the oil phase. However, it should be noted that if the oil used to form the emulsion is a lipid, such as a phospholipid, it may not be necessary to use a surfactant in the oil."

  "negative": "TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The invention pertains to edible formulations for weight regulation. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0002] Weight gain and obesity denote conditions characterized by abnormal or excessive lipid accumulation potentially impairing health. Such states arise from the body's imbalanced control of caloric intake, consumption, and retention. [0003] Obesity signifies a prominent public health dilemma of the 21st century, affecting diverse age and socioeconomic categories internationally. Associated health implications of obesity extend from raised mortality risks to chronic afflictions that diminish life quality. Excessive weight ranks as a significant cause of global mortality. Annually, overweight conditions lead to millions of adult deaths. Moreover, a substantial proportion of diabetes, ischaemic heart diseases, and certain cancers is linked to overweight issues. [0004] Factors contributing to this surge in obesity include a higher consumption of energy-dense foods that are high in saturated fats, sodium, and sugars, and low in essential nutrients, coupled with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle marked by reduced physical exercise. [0005] Prebiotics have drawn attention as potential agents for managing obesity and concurrent metabolic imbalances. Through animal experimentation, prebiotics have been associated with controlling food uptake, hindering weight escalation, favorably adjusting lipid metabolism and mitigating inflammation related to obesity. The majority of research has concentrated on integrating dietary regimens with inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS). [0006] Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary elements selectively enhancing indigenous beneficial gut microbiota such as lactobacilli or bifidobacteria, with growing inclusion in the food industry. Prebiotics, metabolized selectively by colonic bacteria, are recognized for contributing to health improvement. Utilization of prebiotics can induce favorable shifts in the native gut microbial environment, thus fostering probiotics' survival. Unlike typical dietary fibers like pectin and cellulose, prebiotics exhibit selectivity in gut metabolism. A prebiotic must withstand stomach acid, mammalian enzymatic hydrolysis, and gastrointestinal absorption; it should be fermented by intestinal microflora and selectively encourage the growth and/or vitality of intestinal bacteria linked to health and wellness. [0007] A core role of colonic microbiota includes retrieving energy from dietary substances not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract by catalyzing the hydrolysis of composite macromolecules into smaller fragments usable by other gut microbiota members. It's suggested that 7% to 10% of the host's daily energy requisites stem from colonic bacterial fermentation. Without microbial fermentation in the intestines, this energy input for the host is lost, attributed to the absence of necessary enzymes in humans to break down plant polysaccharides, resulting in their elimination as waste. Consequently, the presence of gut microbiota could directly enhance energy recovery via fermentation of dietary polysaccharides. [0008] While obesity emerges from a surplus in caloric input not counterbalanced by escalated energy consumption, individual disparities in gut microbiota composition and behavior might also contribute to variances in energy equilibrium. This suggests that the gut microbiota in obese individuals could more effectively retrieve and/or store energy from certain diets compared to the microbiota in lean individuals. [0009] Certain dietary fibers can generate viscous gels when encountering an aqueous medium, a characteristic believed to promote weight-loss by decelerating stomach emptying, prolonging digestion in the intestinal tract, and reducing post-meal spikes in insulin and glucose. [0010] The consistency of dairy products such as yoghurt can be modified by employing lactic acid bacteria strains producing exopolysaccharides. These exopolysaccharides can heighten the viscosity, density, firmness, and stability of fermented milk items like yoghurt, interact with milk proteins, and potentially preclude the addition of extra thickening agents or fats. Hydrocolloids from plant sources, which are often chemically manipulated or extracted, have been utilized for yogurt texture stabilization; however, their use is limited in some regions, prompting the search for alternative texturing solutions. [0011] Market demand shifts towards products with less fat and sugar, alongside minimal additives. By using bacterial strains secreting requisite exopolysaccharides, the addition of exterior fats to elevate product viscosity is reduced, and so is the need for extra sweeteners, stabilizers, and thickeners. By requiring fewer added ingredients to attain favorable traits, production expenditure drops. [0012] It is also advantageous to enhance the viscosity of foods to bolster satiation among consumers. Such augmentation tends to assist calorie-restricted diets by preventing excessive or frequent ingestion. Foods with thicker textures could also delay gastrointestinal passage, further prolonging fullness. Additionally, foods that form complexes or hinder digestive absorption are also believed to contribute to sustained satiety. Controlling consumption is crucial for weight regulation, by deterring both the amount and frequency of eating.\n",
  "pos": "TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The invention relates to food compositions for weight management. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0002] Overweight and obese are conditions defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. It results from imbalances in the body&#39;s regulation of energy intake, expenditure and storage. [0003] Obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. It is a complex condition, one with serious social and psychological dimensions, that affects virtually all age and socioeconomic groups in both developed and developing countries. The health consequences of obesity range from increased risk of premature death to serious chronic conditions that reduce the overall quality of life. Excess weight is the fifth leading risk for global deaths. At least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. In addition, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischaemic heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to being overweight or obese. [0004] Among the reasons that have led to the dramatic increase in obesity are an increase in the intake of high fat, salt and refined sugar foods that are energy rich but otherwise low in nutritional value (vitamins, minerals, micronutrients) in combination with an increasingly sedentary nature to everyday life with a dramatic decrease in physical activity. [0005] Prebiotics have attracted interests as candidate compounds for the control of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. In animal studies, prebiotics have been shown to regulate the intake of food, prevent weight gain, beneficially alter lipid metabolism and reduce obesity-related inflammation. So far, most studies have focused on simply supplementing the diet with inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS). [0006] Prebiotics are dietary ingredients which can selectively enhance beneficial indigenous gut microbiota, such as lactobacilli or bifidobacteria, and are finding much increased application into the food sector. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that are selectively metabolised by colonic bacteria which contribute to improved health. As such, their use can promote beneficial changes within the indigenous gut microbial milieu and they can therefore help survivability of probiotics. They are distinct from most dietary fibres like pectin, celluloses, xylan, which are not selectively metabolised in the gut. Criteria for classification as a prebiotic is that it must resist gastric acidity, hydrolysis by mammalian enzymes and gastrointestinal absorption, it is fermented by intestinal microflora and selectively stimulates the growth and/or activity of intestinal bacteria associated with health and well-being. [0007] One of the primary functions of the colonic microbiota is to salvage energy from dietary material that has not been digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract, through participating in the initial hydrolysis of complex macromolecules, breaking them down into smaller fragments that can be utilised by other members of the gut microbiota. It is postulated that about 7% to 10% of the total daily energy requirements of the host are derived from colonic bacterial fermentation. In the absence of microbial fermentation in the gut, this energy contribution to would be lost to the host, as humans lack the enzymes necessary to catabolise plant polysaccharides and they would be excreted from the organism as waste. As such, it appears that the presence of a gut microbiota may lead to a direct increase in energy salvaging through the fermentation of dietary polysaccharides. [0008] Although obesity is caused by an excess caloric intake which is not matched by an increase in energy expenditure, differences in gut microbiota composition and activities between individuals may also be an important contributing factor affecting energy homeostasis. This would imply that the gut microbiota of obese individuals would be more efficient in salvaging and/or storing energy from a specific diet compared to the microbiota of lean individuals. [0009] Some dietary fibres can form viscous gels on exposure to an aqueous environment and their gelling properties may account for weight loss promoting effects by delaying gastric emptying, slowing bowel transit time and blunting post-prandial surges in insulin and glucose. [0010] The texture of yoghurt may be modified by using strains of lactic acid bacteria which produce exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides can increase the viscosity, thickness, stability and gel firmness of fermented milk products, including yoghurt. Exopolysaccharides may increase the viscosity of fermented milk products by interacting with milk proteins. The production of exopolysaccharides by the lactic acid culture can reduce the need for bio-thickeners or additional fat to increase the viscosity of the fermented milk product. Hydrocolloids of plant origin have been used to stabilise the gel structure of yoghurt. Many of these hydrocolloids are chemically modified or extracted using various chemicals. As their use is restricted in some countries, there is a need to identify alternative texture modulating agents. [0011] Consumers increasingly demand products with reduced fat and/or sugar content and minimal additives. Using bacterial strains which secrete the desired exopolysaccharides reduces the need to add additional fat to increase the viscosity of fermented milk products. Exopolysaccharide producing strains also reduce the need to add additional sugar, stabilisers and thickeners. As less additional ingredients are needed to achieve desirable sensory characteristics production costs can be reduced. [0012] There is also motivation to increase the viscosity of food products to increase satiation for consumers. Increased satiation can aid those on calorie controlled diets. Food products with a thicker texture may also have a slower transit through the gastrointestinal tract so prolonging the feeling of satiation. Furthermore, food products which also form complexes or impede digestion of food products during digestive transit are also believed to increase the feeling of satiation. Satiation is an important element for controlling food intake and can be used in weight management to discourage eating too much food and/or too regularly. [0013] A food product with a thicker texture may also be useful for the suspension or incorporation of additional ingredients throughout the food product. This is often hard to achieve with food with low viscosity consistency or low fat content. [0014] Many studies have shown that the amount and properties of the exopolysaccharides secreted by bacteria are strain dependent. Exopolysaccharides derived from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus have shown large variation in composition, charge, spatial arrangement, rigidity and ability to interact with proteins. No defining correlation between exopolysaccharide concentration and viscosity of the food product has yet been established. [0015] It is an object of the present invention to provide a formulation which can be used for weight management\u2014whether included as a food stuff or added to food. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a formulation whose components have a synergistic effect on an individual so as to reduce or modulate weight gain. It would be preferably if such a formulation was effective in more than one area of weight management, for example modifying metabolism of fat and reducing energy gain by colonic bacterial fermentation. It would further be preferable to provide a formulation which enhances satiation. It would also be preferable that the formulation could be easily consumed as either a manufactured foodstuff or an additive which could be added to foods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0016] In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition comprising two or more of the following components: a) a microbiome modifying component; b) a satiety modifying component; and c) a metabolic modifying component, and at least one of the following: d) Streptococcus thermophilus CBS 139100 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CBS 139099 microbial strains or mutant strains or fragments or fractions thereof; e) a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus microbial strains which together, or individually, are capable of secreting polysaccharides having high levels of galactosamine and no or low levels of rhamnose and glucuronic acid when grown on a dairy substrate; or f) polysaccharides formed of: i. 15-25% galactosamine; ii. 45-60% galactose; and iii. 20-30% glucose.

More preferably, the food stabilising composition comprises about 22% galactosamine, about 52% galactose and/or about 26% glucose. [0035] If the composition comprises f) then it may further comprise Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus microbial strains or fragments or fractions thereof. Such strains will preferably comprise Streptococcus thermophilus CBS 139100 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CBS 139099 microbial strains, or mutant strains thereof. [0036] The microbiome modifying component may further comprise one or more additional microbial strains. Such additional microbial strains could be bacterial and fall within the scope of what is typically considered to be a \u201cprobiotic\u201d. The skilled addressee will also recognise that Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus are also generally understood to be \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacteria. However, additional strains and/or species of probiotics may also be utilised within the composition. The microbiome modifying component may comprise or further comprise a growth medium for at least one or more of the desired microbial strains\u2014these strains could already be present in the individual or included as part of the composition. [0037] The microbiome modifying component may also comprise a selective microbial growth inhibitor and/or microbial cidal compound. Therefore the microbial strains which are already present in the individual may be manipulated by encouraging growth, inhibiting growth or actively killed. Such manipulation allows to the desired microbial population to be selected so as to provide their associated health benefits. [0038] The microbiome modifying component preferably further comprises a prebiotic. If desired, the prebiotic may be producible by the probiotic bacterial strain by reverse enzyme reaction. The satiety modifying component preferably acts mechanistically to suppress appetite. The metabolic modifying component preferably acts to increase metabolism and/or modify insulin sensitivity. [0039] The satiety modifying component may comprise dietary fibre and the metabolic modifying component may comprise chromium. [0040] The term \u201cdietary fibre\u201d is intended to mean indigestible portions of food derived from plants which comprise soluble and insoluble fibres. [0041] The term \u201cchromium\u201d covers all dietary chromium, including trivalent chromium (Cr(III) or Cr 3+ ) which naturally occurs in trace amounts in foods and water in addition to chromium chloride. Chromium acts systemically potentiating insulin action, increasing metabolic rate, influencing carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism and maintaining glucose levels. [0042] The term \u201cprebiotic\u201d is intended to mean a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora flora that confers benefits upon host wellbeing and health. Prebiotics act in the colon and produce changes in the microbial flora which affect energy metabolism and gut peptides involved in satiation (GLP 1 , GLP 2 ). These have a long acting affect. [0043] Preferably, the dietary fibre comprises glucomannan. Gucomannam acts primarily in the stomach by suppressing appetite by gel formation in the stomach, causing distension and activating mechanoreceptors that signal increased satiety and fullness. [0044] Preferably the prebiotic comprises one or more selected from: inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), \u03b1-gluco-oligosaccharides, a low gas producing prebiotic and combinations thereof. [0045] The dietary fibre may be present in an amount sufficient to provide a daily dose in the range of 0.5 to 15 g. The dietary dose may be in the range of 1 g to 3 g per day. More preferably, the dietary dose may be in the range of 1.5 g to 2.5 g per day. The chromium may be present in an amount sufficient to provide a daily dose in the range of 50 to 1000 \u03bcg. The chromium may be in a dose in the range of 100 to 750 \u03bcg per day. More preferably, the chromium may be in a dose in the range of 200 to 500 \u03bcg per day. [0046] The prebiotic may be present in an amount sufficient to provide a daily dose in the range of 3 to 30 g. The prebiotic may be in a dose of 5 to 25 g per day. More preferably, the prebiotic may be in a dose of 10 to 20 g per day. [0047] The composition may comprise a combination of: [0048] a) glucomannan and chromium; [0049] b) glucomannan, FOS and chromium; [0050] c) glucomannan and FOS; or [0051] d) glucomannan and a low gas producing prebiotic. [0052] It will be apparent to the skilled addressee that the composition may be in any easily digestible form of a foodstuff or food additive. The composition could be used as a dietary supplement\u2014for example to be blended with foods/drinks or consumed alongside foods/drinks. The composition may be grown on a dairy substrate and/or is formed as part of a dairy substrate or product or is used as a feedstock, ingredient or additive for use with a fermented or fermentable dairy foodstuff. Preferably, the composition may be formulated as a fermented or fermentable dairy foodstuff, such as yoghurt. The fermented or fermentable dairy foodstuff may be selected from one or more of the following: yoghurt, cheese, cr\u00e8me fraiche, sour cream, buttermilk, kefir, acidophilus milk, koumiss, filmj\u00f6lk and viili. The fermented dairy foodstuffs may comprise fermented milk drinks used as prebiotics or probiotics. [0053] Alternatively, the composition may be formulated as an additive, ingredient or starter culture for fermented or fermentable dairy foodstuffs [0054] The composition may further comprise one or more ingredients selected from: sweeteners, stabilisers, acidity regulators, water, flavourings, fats, emulsifiers, plant and/or vegetable extracts, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, antioxidants, and combinations thereof. [0055] Sweeteners such as sugar, aspartame, fructose, glucose-fructose syrup and combinations thereof may be employed. [0056] Stabilisers such as alginate, carrageenan, gelatin, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, modified maize starch, maltodextrin, starch and combinations thereof can be utilised. However, it should be noted that the combination of Streptococcus thermophilus CBS 139100 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CBS 139099 microbial strains have been advantageously been found to confer superior gel-like properties to foodstuffs. The gel-like properties have been demonstrated to not only increase viscosity of liquids, but also maintain smoothness of the liquids over time. This has been found to be particularly advantageous for fermented or fermentable milk products such as yoghurts. It is believed that the improved gel-like properties are a result of the secretion (or indeed lack of secretion) of certain exopolysaccharides. As mentioned earlier, exopolysaccharides can increase the viscosity, thickness, stability and gel firmness of fermented milk products, such as yoghurt and exopolysaccharides may increase the viscosity of fermented milk products by interacting with milk proteins. The production of exopolysaccharides by the strains of this invention reduce the need for bio-thickeners or additional fat to increase the viscosity of the fermented milk product. It has been found that these particular strains produce greater amounts of galactosamine, galactose and glucose as opposed to other strains which produce greater amounts of rhamnose, mannose and glucuronic. It follows that if the composition is formulated in the form of a liquid, commonly used stabilisers can be included in smaller quantities or removed all together if desired by the use of the strains included in the composition of the present invention. Furthermore, low-fat formulations can also be prepared as the higher fat content is no longer required to increase viscosity. [0057] It will be noted that in place of the strains, a mixture of the polysaccharides secreted by the microbial strains may be used in conjunction with the invention so as to contribute to the gel-like properties and increased viscosity. Additional components such as surfactants (or indeed fragments, fractions or components of the microbial strains) may be utilised in the composition to replace the physical and other properties that the strains themselves should only the exopolysaccharides be used independently."

  "query": "What improvements have been made in catheter technology for deploying multiple stents with variable diameters during a single angioplastic session?,",
  "negative": "The invention concerns medical devices, aligning with the development of a versatile intraluminal catheter. It encompasses a catheter purposed for releasing one or several intraluminal prostheses, commonly referred to as stents, into a vessel. In one version, the catheter comes with a multiplicity of lumens, permitting stents of varying diameters or potentially similar dimensions to be transported. Additionally, the catheter employs a single inflation mechanism to enlarge any stent encircling it. Comprising a maneuvering device, it empowers movement of the prostheses with respect to the inflation mechanism, which can involve transposing the catheter with respect to the prostheses or vice versa. In the case of a specific realization of the technology, the maneuvering device includes an adaptable component that can travel along the catheter to advance the prostheses towards the inflation apparatus so that they may encase it. This apparatus, once activated, expands the prosthesis, after which it retreats, keeping the prosthesis in an enlarged condition for therapeutic support. The device facilitates implantation at several regions within the same operation without the need to reintroduce the catheter for each separate placement, thereby reducing patient discomfort and minimizing vessel damage risks.\n\n",

No. 11/421,653 filed Jun. 1, 2006, now abandoned, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/108,985 filed Mar. 29, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,147,655, which claims the benefit of foreign priority to IL 142332 filed Mar. 29, 2001, each of which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to catheters and more specifically to such catheters that are used to implant a stent in an artery. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Blood vessels, and particularly arteries, may become stenotic or occluded due to various atherosclerotic processes. A stenotic artery may be treated by balloon angioplasty in which an inflatable balloon mounted on a catheter tip is inserted into the arterial system and navigated through the arterial system to the diseased artery. The balloon is then inflated by means of a pressurized fluid. This causes the balloon to press radially on the arterial wall so as to open the stenosis. A stent may be crimped onto the balloon before insertion so that when the balloon is inflated the stent becomes expanded. The balloon is deflated and withdrawn leaving the expanded stent in the artery. These and other similar methods are well known to the skilled man of the art. It is often necessary to treat several stenoses in a single angioplastic session. For example, it may be necessary to insert a large diameter stent at one location, a small diameter stent at a second location and to perform a balloon angioplasty without a stent at a third location. This could be accomplished by sequential insertion and withdrawal of a catheter, the catheter being loaded each time with the appropriate stent prior to insertion. This however would cause much discomfort to the patient, prolongs the duration of the procedure and increases the chances of damaging a blood vessel. U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,519 discloses a catheter for deploying one or more stents. The stent has one or more individually expandable segments along its length. A stent, in its unexpanded state, is loaded onto each expandable segment of the catheter. The catheter is inserted into the vascular system and positioned with the first expandable segment in a stenosis. An axial force is then applied to the segment causing it to buckle outwards and expand the stent. The force is then removed causing the segment to unbuckle leaving the stent in its expanded state. The catheter is then navigated to another stenosis. This process is repeated until all of the stents have been deployed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a catheter for deploying one or more stents in a cardiovascular system. The catheter is configured to carry one or more stents. Preferably, the catheter carries a plurality of stents. The stents may be of different or the same widths. An inflatable balloon is used to expand a stent surrounding the balloon. The catheter comprises a positioner for moving a stent relative to the balloon from a position in which the stent does not surround the balloon to a position that it does surround the balloon in order to prime the stent for expansion by the balloon. The phrase \u201cfor moving a stent relative to the balloon\u201d includes two possibilities, i.e. moving the positioner relative to the balloon and moving the balloon relative to the positioner. In one embodiment of the invention the positioner comprises an element configured to slide along the catheter and push the stents distally along the catheter so as to move a stent adjacent to the balloon into a position in which it surrounds the balloon. The sliding element is pushed along the catheter by means of a wire extending along the catheter from its proximal end to the sliding element. In this embodiment, the stents are deployed in the order in which they are carried by the catheter, starting with the stent closest to the balloon. In another embodiment, the positioner comprises a flexible carriage configured to carry the one or more stents. The carriage is capable of sliding along the catheter in order to bring one of the stents from a position in which the stent does not surround the balloon to a position in which the stent surrounds the balloon. The carriage is moved in either direction along the catheter by means of a wire extending along the catheter from its proximal end to the carriage. It is also possible to position the stent opposite a desired location in the vascular system and slide the balloon through the carriage to a position opposite the stent. In this embodiment the stents may be deployed in the vascular system in any order. It a third embodiment, the catheter comprises two positioners, one posterior positioner as described above in the first embodiment positioned posterior to the balloon, and a second anterior positioner positioned anterior to the balloon. In this embodiment, the anterior positioner may be distanced from the balloon so as to provide a storage space between the anterior positioner and the balloon. The balloon in this embodiment may be a conventional balloon used in balloon angioplasty. In this embodiment also, the stents may be deployed in the vascular system in any order, and may be of different lengths. In use, the catheter is loaded with one or more stents and inserted into a vascular system. The catheter is navigated through the vascular system until the balloon or stent is positioned at a first desired location, typically the site of a stenosis. The stent or balloon is then moved by the positioner so that the stent surrounds the balloon and the balloon is inflated so as to expand the stent. The balloon is then deflated, leaving the expanded stent at the first desired location. This process may be repeated, each time deploying a different stent at a different location. After one or more of the stents have been deployed, the catheter may be removed from the vascular system. The invention also provides a method for deploying a stent in a desired location of a vascular system comprising the steps of: (a) inserting a catheter according to the invention carrying one or more stents into the vascular system, (b) navigating the catheter through the vascular system until the balloon is positioned in the desired location; (c) moving a stent from a first position in which it does not surround the balloon to a second position in which it surrounds the balloon; (d) inflating the balloon so as to expand the stent; and (e) deflating the balloon.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Example I FIG. 1 shows a catheter 100 for deploying stents in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The catheter 100 has a distal end 108 and a proximal end 120. The catheter 100 comprises a flexible tube 102 , which is connected to an inflatable balloon 104 proximate to its distal end. The balloon 104 is shown in the Figure in its deflated state. A radio-opaque marker 118 is located on the balloon wall. The catheter 100 has at its distal end 108 a tapered tip 110 that may be inserted into a stenosis in order to open the stenosis. A syringe 130 may be used to introduce a fluid into the tube 102 in order to inflate the balloon 104 as described in detail below. A longitudinal shaft 124 in the wall of the tube 102 is configured to receive a guidewire 126 used in navigating the catheter in the vascular system. A neck region 122 of the tube 102 intervenes between the distal end of the balloon 104 and the tip 110. The proximal end of the tip 110 is broadened to form a shoulder at the distal end of the neck region 122. A sliding positioner element in the form of an annular sliding ring 114 is mounted on the tube 102 proximal to the balloon 104. The ring 114 is slidable along the tube 102 by means of a wire 116 that extends along the length of the tube 102 from the proximal end 120 of the catheter to the ring 114. The sliding ring 114 and the wire 116 form a positioner for moving a stent from a position which it does not surround the balloon 104 to a position in which it surrounds the balloon 104. FIG. 2 shows the catheter 100 having a plurality of stents (three are shown in FIG. 2 ) 206 a , 206 b and 206 c , mounted on the tube 102 between the sliding ring 114 and the balloon 104. The stents are separated from each other by separating rings 208 a and 208 b. The sliding ring 114 has been positioned so that the separating rings 208 a and 208 b and the stent 206 are contiguous with the balloon 104. Each stent 206 bears a radio-opaque markers 210 a , 210 b and 210 c. In use, the catheter 100 is introduced into the vascular system and navigated to a stenosis by methods well known in the art. FIG. 3 shows the catheter 100 after having been navigated through the vascular system and positioned inside a blood vessel 202. The balloon is located opposite a stenotic region 204 of the blood vessel 202. The wire 116 is used to slide the sliding ring 114 distally along the tube 102 so as to push the stents 206 a , 206 b , 206 c , distally. The sliding ring 114 is pushed distally along the tube 102 so that the stent 206 a is pushed over and around the balloon 104 , which is thereby brought into the lumen of the stent 206 a , and the marker 118 on the balloon coincides with the marker 210 a of the stent, as determined for example by x-ray angiography. FIG. 4 shows the stent 206 a surrounding the balloon 104. A fluid is then introduced into the tube 102. The fluid passes through the tube 102 and inflates the balloon 104. It will be understood that the balloon may be inflated by other conventional means, as are known in the art. Inflation of the balloon 104 expands the stent 206 a onto the stenotic region of the blood vessel 202 , as shown in FIG. 5. The fluid is then withdrawn from the tube 102. Withdrawal of the fluid from the tube 102 causes the balloon to deflate. After deflation of the balloon, the stent 206 a remains in situ in its expanded state. The catheter may then be navigated through the arterial system until the catheter is positioned with the balloon 104 at another stenotic region of a blood vessel. The sliding ring is pushed distally by the wire 116 so that the succeeding stent 206 b overlies the balloon 104 and the marker 118 coincides with the marker 210 b on the stent 206 b. The distal separating ring 208 a is pushed along the tube 102 , beyond the balloon 104 to the neck region 122 of the tube, where the separating rings are stored. The shoulder of the tip 110 retains the separating rings on the neck region. This process may be repeated until some or all of the stents 206 have been deployed. The catheter is then removed from the body. Example II FIG. 6 shows a catheter 600 for deploying stents in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. The embodiment of FIG. 6 has many components in common with the embodiment of FIG. 1 , and similar components are identified by the same reference numeral in both embodiments. The embodiment of FIG. 6 has a cylindrical carriage 605 mounted on the tube 102. The carriage has a plurality of annular depressions (three are shown in FIG. 6 ) 610 a , 610 b and 610 c configured to receive a stent as described below. The depressions 610 all have the same length A as indicated in FIG. 6 , which is essentially equal to the length of the balloon 104. Between the depressions 610 are barriers 620 a and 620 b. The carriage 605 is made from an elastic material such as rubber. The carriage 605 is slidable along the tube 102 by means of a wire 116 that extends along the length of the tube 102 from the proximal end 120 of the catheter to the carriage 605. The carriage 605 and the wire 116 form a positioner for moving a stent from a position in which it does not surround the balloon 104 to a position in which it surrounds the balloon 104. FIG. 7 shows the catheter 600 having a plurality of stents (three are shown in FIG. 7 ) 206 a , 206 b and 206 c mounted on the annular depressions of the tube 102. The stents are separated from each other by the barriers 620 a and 620 b. In the present embodiment the stents are of different lengths. However, they may also be of the same length. Each stent 206 bears a radio-opaque annular marker 210 a , 210 b and 210 c. The catheter 600 is introduced into the vascular system and navigated to a stenosis by methods well known in the art. FIG. 8 shows the catheter 600 after having been navigated through the vascular system and positioned inside a blood vessel 202. The balloon is located within a stenotic region 204 of the blood vessel 202. The wire 116 is used to slide the cage 605 distally along the tube 102 so as to move the stents 206 distally. The carriage 605 is pushed distally along the tube 102 until the balloon 104 is brought into the lumen of the stent 206 a and the marker 118 on the tube coincides with the marker 210 a , as determined for example by x-ray angiography. In a similar manner, the balloon may be slid within the carriage until it is positioned opposite the stent. FIG. 9 shows the stent 206 a surrounding the balloon 104. A fluid is then introduced into the tube 102. The fluid passes through the tube 102 and inflates the balloon 104. Inflation of the tube 104 expands the portion of the carriage 605 surrounding the balloon 104 which in turn expands the stent 206 a onto the stenotic region of the blood vessel 202 , as shown in FIG. 10. The fluid is then withdrawn from the tube 102 into the syringe 130. Withdrawal of the fluid from the tube 102 causes the balloon to deflate. After deflation of the balloon, the stent 206 a remains in its expanded state. The catheter is then navigated through the arterial system until the catheter is positioned with the balloon 104 in another stenotic region of a blood vessel. The catheter is then pushed distally by the wire 116 so that the stent 206 b overlies the balloon 104 and the marker 118 coincides with the marker 210 b on the stent 206 b. In this embodiment, the stents may be deployed in any order. This process may be repeated until some or all of the stents 206 have been deployed. The catheter is then removed from the body. Example III This example illustrates an embodiment which is an improvement over the embodiment described in Example I. With reference to FIG. 11 , there is shown a catheter 700 having a distal end 108 and a proximal end 120. As in FIG. 1 , the catheter 700 comprises a flexible tube 102 , which is connected to an inflatable balloon 704 proximate to its distal end. A radio-opaque marker 118 is located on the balloon wall. The catheter 700 has at its distal end 108 a tapered tip 110 , but unlike in Example I, there is no neck region, and the tip is not enlarged. The balloon in this embodiment may be a conventional inflatable balloon used in balloon angioplasty. As in Example I, a guidewire 126 extends along the tube 102 , exiting at the distal end 108 of the catheter. An anterior positioner in the form of a perforated sphere 706 is fixed to the guidewire anterior to the balloon 704 , e.g. the guidewire passes through a bore channel extending through the sphere. The diameter of the sphere is slightly larger than the diameter of the retracted stents which are mounted on the catheter."

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present inventions relate to dental hygiene and, more particularly, to toothbrushes. [0004] 2. Description of the Related Art [0005] To ensure proper oral care, dentists recommend that we brush our teeth more than once a day for at least two to three minutes each time. Despite this recommendation, the average adult person does not brush his or her teeth for two to three minutes. This problem is worse with children, who have notoriously short attention spans and often view brushing their teeth as a chore. Accordingly, there is a general need for a device that encourages people, especially children, to brush their teeth more often and for longer periods of time. See e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004-0143920, filed Jan. 24, 2003 and published on Jul. 29, 2004, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004-0143920 describes a toothbrush with a handle having a base, a body, and a head. The body can have a first section and a second section forming an oblique angle. A projector of a beam of light located within the handle. The toothbrush can have at least one bristle attached to the head. The toothbrush can have a grip attached to the base. An illumination circuit can be positioned within the handle and is operated by pressing an end of the handle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0032] FIG. 1 illustrates a prior art illuminated toothbrush 10 , which comprises a handle 12 , an illumination circuit 14 , a brush 16 , and a grip 18. [0033] As shown in FIG. 1 , the handle 12 comprises a base 20 , a body 21 , and a head 26. The body 21 has a first section 22 and a second section 24. The handle 12 can be formed of hard, clear plastic. In one arrangement, the handle 12 can be a colored plastic. In another arrangement, the handle 12 can be a translucent plastic. In yet another embodiment, the handle 12 may be fashioned out of a plastic incorporating metallic flake 55. [0034] The toothbrush handle 12 can be formed through an injection molding process. In such an embodiment, plastic in a liquid form can be injected into a mold having two sections. Liquid plastic can be injected into the mold where it is then allowed to solidify. When the mold is opened it creates a handle having a brush side 28 and a non-brush side 30. At the intersection of these two sides 28 , 30 can be a ridge 32. The ridge 32 can be a surface characteristic resulting from the injection molding process. In the illustrated arrangement, the ridge 32 does not extend inside the handle 12 but exists on the surface. The injection molding process in constructing of the toothbrush handle 12 is conventional and does not form a part of the present invention. [0035] As seen in FIGS. 5 , 6 , and 8 , the handle 12 can include a handle base 20. The base 20 can be generally cylindrical in shape and can have a circumferential groove or cavity 44 therein. The circumferential groove 44 can have a centerline. The base 20 has an outside surface 34 , an inside surface 36 , a first end 38 , and a second end 40. In the illustrated arrangement, on the outside surface 34 of the base 20 are three annular rings 42. The annular rings 42 can provide a ledge upon which the grip 18 holds. [0036] The inside surface 36 defines the cavity 44. The inside surface 36 can have a first indentation 46 and a second indentation 48. The cavity 44 can serve as a housing for the illumination circuit 14. The first and second indentation 46 , 48 can serve as a guide for positioning the illumination circuit 14 within the base 20. [0037] A chamber 50 can extend within the section 22. The chamber 50 has a first end 52 and a second end 54. The chamber 50 can be generally cylindrical in shape. The first end 52 can be rounded and can provide a transition between the chamber 50 filled full of air and the first section 22 which is of plastic. The air is inherently present as a result of assembly at a time after the handle was formed. Alternatively, the chamber may be filled full of a material in a process separate from the forming of the handle. [0038] The second end 54 of the chamber 50 can be open to the first end 38 of the base 20. The first section chamber 50 can be in off-center alignment with the base 20. As seen in FIG. 8 , the first section chamber 50 is in off-center alignment with the base 20 to allow the projector of a light beam or illuminating member 60 to emit a light beam 56 that travels through the first section 22 and to strike the interface 65 between the second section 24 and atmosphere. At this interface, a light beam 57 can be reflected towards the handle head 26 and a light beam 58 can be refracted towards the atmosphere. [0039] The first section chamber 50 can be also positioned in off-center alignment with the base 20 because in the first section 22 is ergometrically designed to accommodate a user&#39;s grip. In the ergometric design, the brush side 28 of the first section 22 is contoured and the non brush side 30 of the first section 22 is flat. In addition, the brush side 28 of the first section 22 arrives at a point of the second section 24 at a greater angle than the non brush side 30. In other words, the illumination circuit 14 extends within the first section 22 substantially parallel to the center line of the base member 20 but the first section 22 brush side 28 angles toward the inner point where the first section 22 meets the second section 24 and the non brush side 30 portion of the first section 22 also angles toward the point where the first section 22 meets the second section 24. Thus, for the first section chamber 50 to extend the furthest into the first section 22 of the handle 12 , the first section chamber 50 is preferably positioned closer to the non-brush side 30 of the first section 22. [0040] The illumination circuit 14 can have an illuminating member or projector of a light beam 60 , a resistor 62 , a timing circuit 64 , and a power source 66. These parts can be joined by the conductor 68 , which provides a support structure extending the illuminating member 60 a distance away from the timing circuit 64. The negative terminal conductor 70 can be a spring which presses against the power source 66 , which in the illustrated arrangement comprises a series of batteries. The positive terminal conductor 72 can comprise a pair of prongs that extends away from the timing circuit 64 to embrace the power source 66. The positive terminal conductor 72 can also be sized to stabilize the illumination circuit 14 within the base 20 as the positive terminal conductor 72 is sized to fit within the first indentation 46 and the second indentation 48 of the base 20. [0041] The illumination member 60 in this embodiment is a light emitting diode (LED). In other embodiments, the illumination member 60 could be an incandescent light bulb. In still other embodiments, the illumination member 60 may be any other device known in the art that may provide illumination. [0042] The power source 66 in one arrangement can be micro-cell battery model number G3-ACNB. In the illustrated arrangement, three batteries are placed in series within the base 20. The timing circuit 64 preferably can function to illuminate the illumination member 60 for approximately 60 seconds. The timing circuit 64 also preferably can serve to control the illumination member 60 to blink intermittently for the time period in which it is engaged. In some embodiments, the illumination member 60 may stay on continuously and/or illuminate for a longer or shorter period of time. In the illustrated embodiment, the circuit is activated by closing an electrical switch 74 to complete a circuit. [0043] The brush 16 can have a bristle 80. The bristle 80 can have a first end 82 and a second end 84. The bristle second end 84 can be embedded in the head 26 of the handle 12. In one arrangement, the bristle 80 can be made of clear plastic material. Moreover, in such an arrangement, the brush 10 can be configured such that, when the bristle 80 is struck by light traveling from the illumination member 60 through the first section 22 and the second section 24 , a portion of the light striking the bristle 80 may reflect through the bristle 80 and extend out of the bristle 80. [0044] The grip 18 can be made of a flexible material. In the illustrated arrangement, the grip 18 can also serve as a switch. For example, the grip 18 can have an extending piece or switch 74 of flexible material as seen in FIG. 7. When the grip is pushed in the direction of arrow A in FIG. 4 , the piece 74 moves the positive terminal metal conductor 72 to contact the power source 66. Alternatively, the piece 74 moves the power source 66 to contact the positive terminal metal conductor 72. In doing so, the piece 74 moves illumination circuit 14 from an un-illuminated position to a illuminated position. The grip 18 can remain in place on the base 20 by engaging the annular rings 42 on the outside surface 34 of the base 20. An adhesive 88 can be positioned between the first section 22 and the grip 18 to hold the grip 18 in close connection with the first section 22. [0045] The grip 18 can be made of a flexible material. Alternatively, the grip 18 may be of a hard material but have a flexible portion that may be used to engage the positive terminal conductor 72 and press against the power source 66. [0046] In operation, the illuminated toothbrush 10 is used by a user to indicate the duration of an amount of time. The user grips the toothbrush handle 12 in their hand with the bristle 80 surface with the bristle 80 against their teeth and engages the illumination circuit switch 74. The illumination member 60 begins to blink intermittently in an on/off fashion. The illumination member 60 continues to blink for a period of approximately 60 seconds. The handle is designed to direct light to the user in multiple ways so that the user may be accurately apprised of brushing time. The frequency of blinking can remain constant, or vary in frequency. In some embodiments, the frequency can increase as the time approaches 60 seconds. In some embodiments, the frequency can remain constant through a first period of time, and increase in frequency in a second period of time. In one example, the frequency can remain constant for approximately 45 seconds; then increase for the remaining 15 seconds. In other embodiments, different time intervals can be used, such as, for example, two even periods of thirty seconds each. [0047] A light beam 59 travels from the illuminating device 14 through a first section chamber 50. The light beam 59 strikes an interface 63 between the first section chamber and the first section and a light beam 61 is partially reflected off of the interface and a light beam 56 is refracted enters the first chamber."

  "query": "How does the integration of a line tension measuring device in a fishing pole handle contribute to the precision of drag adjustment during fishing?,",
  "negative": "The innovation comprises a fishing rod with a built-in force detection mechanism. Precise calibration of angling equipment resistance, known as 'drag,' has historically lacked objective assessments. Typically, an angler estimates the resistance force by manual pull and sets the tackle's resistance according to their tactile judgment. When engaging with fish, assessing the force exerted by the catch on the equipment remains challenging. The technology, an angling rod incorporating a real-time force gauge, exhibits the actual force exerted on the apparatus in measurable metrics, such as pounds or kilograms, allowing the angler to meticulously calibrate the tackle's resistance and monitor the force exerted by the catch. The force is gauged constantly, granting the angler the ability to fine-tune the resistance in the midst of the activity. The innovation is pertinent to the realm of angling and particularly to the engineering of angling rods. Discussions on previous devices reveal a continuous quest for accurate resistance adjustment in recreational fishing. Traditional angling reels control the line's resistance via several methodologies. Attempts to quantify the resistance or braking force on the line have led to the disclosure of various instruments. For instance, previous devices with scales and hooks intended for attachment to a reel to calibrate it exist but are not practical for the commonplace angler who prefers their line to run uninterrupted through their rod\u2019s guides with a bait or hook at the end. Using such devices on an angling rod in a 'rigged' state, where the line is threaded and a bait affixed, necessitates cumbersome methods such as coupling to the bait or creating a loop in the line, all of which result in impracticality and are not favored by anglers. Other prior art includes a handheld scale designed by Yamanouchi, which measures resistance by passing the line through a pulley system, presenting logistic challenges for the angler. Hirose devised a reel with a built-in tension gauge using advanced components to translate spool shaft torque into line force, which, although functional, would entail a complex and costly resolution. Conversely, the described invention provides cost advantages over reel-based systems and is compatible with extant reels used by anglers who often interchange reels based on the fish species sought. Another disclosed patent from Adams et al. offers a signaling gadget that doesn\u2019t quantitatively gauge the force on the line, but merely indicates varying degrees of force via colored lights. Such a device necessitates the internal threading of the line, which is disadvantageous for casting and sensitivity during fishing. Despite inventions and devices to aid resistance setting, the conventional practice still primarily involves manual force estimation prior to fishing. The innovation described in this document aims to redefine this procedure and offer precise force readings to assist anglers in effectively adjusting the resistance. The significance of reporting real line force stems from the fact that angling reels do not enforce steady line force but nearly stable resistance torque. The actual force controlled by resistance fluctuates due to factors like the spool radius and the dynamic nature of resistance mechanisms. It is practically infeasible to ascertain real-time line force when engaged with a catch and how it changes upon adjusting the reel's resistance. Summarily, the described invention, an angling rod with a built-in force gauge, measures the line force perpetually without additional equipment. Anglers can use the invention to observe and modify the applied line force, critically during a confrontation with a fish. The provision presents the force metrics persistently, allowing immediate recognition of resistance alterations. Subsequent sections detail further advantages and the configurations of the invention through illustrative embodiments and accompanying illustrations.\n\n",
  "pos": "The invention is a fishing pole with an integrated line tension measuring device. Measuring fishing line tension or \u201cdrag\u201d has always been subjective. Most often a fisherman pulls on the line by hand and adjusts the drag, or braking force on the reel, based on what the pull \u2018feels\u2019 like. While fighting a fish, it is difficult to know how hard the fish is pulling on the line. The invention, a fishing pole that measures and displays the actual pull on the line in quantitative units, e.g. pounds or kilograms, enables the fisherman to accurately set the drag and know how hard a fish is pulling on the line. The line tension is measured and displayed continuously, thereby enabling the fisherman to accurately adjust the drag even when fighting a fish. FIELD OF INVENTION This invention applies to the field of fishing and more particularly to the design of fishing poles. DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART In the field of sport fishing, the desire for a proper drag setting is a continuing, yet unsatisfied goal. Current fishing reels apply a drag, or braking force, to the line by a variety of mechanisms. In an effort to measure the drag or braking force on the line, a variety of apparatus have been disclosed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 960,535 Gilfillan, Jun. 7, 1910; U.S. Pat. No. 2,603,474, Mandolf, Jul. 15, 1952; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,660,666; Reder, Apr. 28, 1987, disclose fishing scales and weights that are equipped with hooks to attach to a reel to be adjusted. In the practical environment, however, fishermen prefer to keep their fishing line threaded through the \u201ceyes\u201d of their fishing rods with a lure or hook tied at the end of the line. A rod and reel set maintained in this form is termed \u201crigged.\u201d To measure the drag on a rigged rod and reel using the aforementioned systems, the hook would either have to be attached at the lure, or to a loop tied on the fishing line between the reel and the first eye of the rod. In the first method, setting the drag would require one person to hold the scale, while a second person holds the reel to monitor the drag release. While the second method can be performed by a single person by attaching the scale to the loop, this would require re-threading the line through the eyes of the rod and retying the lure each time that a drag measurement is performed. Both approaches are impractical and not used by the average fisherman. U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,198 issued to Yamanouchi, Jan. 15, 2002 discloses a hand held scale to measure line drag by threading the line through a pulley and pulling the scale apparatus away from the reel until the drag slips. This approach is difficult and requires the fisherman to carry this extra apparatus with him. U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,038 issued to Hirose Jun. 17, 1997 discloses a fishing reel with a mechanism for measuring line tension. This device employs a coil opposed to thin magnetostrictive bands bonded to the spool shaft to determine the torque applied to the spool shaft. In order to translate torque into line tension, the height of the line wound onto the spool must be determined with, for example, an ultrasonic measuring device. While this device may actually produce a quantifiable measurement, the circuitry involved is relatively complex and would be correspondingly expensive. Fishing reels are already one of the more significant expenses in fishing and purchasing new reels with this type of mechanism would be very expensive. The present invention described herein allows significant cost savings versus a reel based measurement system. The present invention allows the fisherman to use any existing fishing reel. Often times a fisherman will use a single pole with a variety of different reels, depending on the species of fish he is targeting. U.S. Pat. No. 4,422,258 issued to Adams, et al. Dec. 27, 1983 discloses a device for measuring and signaling of fishing line pull which can be attached to a fishing pole. This device does not measure the line pull in quantitative units, but displays various color lights to indicate the amount of pull. This device requires the fishing line to be internally threaded through it for the line to press against the spring biased rod which switches the lights. Those skilled in the art realize that threading the fishing line through any device adversely impacts its practical application for fishing. For most types of fishing, the fishing line must run free from the reel through the fishing pole guides with no obstruction. Any additional routing of the fishing line through measuring apparatus will adversely impact both casting, where the line must run free and unimpeded from the reel, and fishing, where the fisherman needs the line sensitivity to feel the bait swimming and the target fish biting. In spite of the aforementioned patents and devices, incorporated herein by reference, drag setting is still a practice normally performed prior to fishing by pulling the line by hand and setting the fishing reel drag to what \u2018feels\u2019 right. The present invention will change this and provide the user with accurate feedback in quantitative units, pounds or kilograms, to assist in accurately set the drag. Reporting actual fishing line tension is important because current fishing reels do not apply constant fishing line tension. Fishing reel drags apply a near constant braking torque on the fishing line spool. The actual line tension applied by the drag varies due to a variety of factors however. It is readily apparent to those skilled in the art, that the actual line tension applied by the drag is dependent on the distance from the center of the spool to the outside of the fishing line winding. Therefore, the drag applied tension on the line varies relative to the amount of line on the spool. Additionally, the amount of drag applied by a reel may change as the drag mechanism heats or cools or binds. Once a fisherman is engaged on a fish, the line tension varies due to the factors discussed in the previous paragraph. It is currently impossible to know the actual line tension when fighting a fish. It is also impossible to know accurately how the line tension changes when adjusting the drag while fighting a fish. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention, a fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device, measures the fishing line tension at all times without any ancillary apparatus. The invention provides the constant measurement and display of fishing line tension in quantitative units, e.g. pounds or kilograms. Using the invention, the user can monitor the fishing line tension applied by the drag precisely both before fishing, and more importantly, while a fish is being fought. The invention allows the fisherman to adjust the drag and view the resulting line tension change immediately. Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings which set forth illustrative embodiments in which the principles of the invention are described.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Many of the figures describing the preferred embodiments of the inventions show a fishing reel for illustrative purposes. The fishing reel itself is not part of the invention. FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. A fishing pole consists of a rod ( 1 ) and handle ( 2 ). The rod extends all the way through the center of the handle to the base of the fishing pole. A reel seat ( 3 ), or place to connect the reel, is commonly situated in the center section of the handle. In this embodiment, the line tension measuring device ( 4 ) and line tension display ( 5 ) are integrated into the handle portion of the fishing pole. FIG. 2 is a perspective view detailing the handle portion of the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. The handle consist of the forward grip ( 11 ), a sliding reel mount ( 7 ), and the butt ( 10 ). The reel ( 9 ) is connected to the sliding reel mount ( 7 ) in the standard fashion. The reel ( 9 ) is solidly affixed to the sliding reel mount ( 7 ) and together act and move as a single unit. The sliding reel mount ( 7 ) is mounted on an internal spline or slide ( 8 ) which allows the reel/reel mount body ( 7 , 9 ) to move in the longitudinal direction along the long axis of the pole. The length of travel is very small and will be barely noticeable by the user. Rotation is prevented by the internal spline or slide ( 8 ). The sliding reel mount ( 7 ) contacts the pressure sensor ( 6 ) which measures the force applied by the fishing line ( 1 ). The fishing line ( 1 ) pulls the reel ( 9 ) and sliding reel mount ( 7 ) into the pressure sensor ( 6 ). The signal from the pressure sensor ( 6 ) drives the line tension display device ( 2 ) through the electronics package ( 5 ). Since the fishing line ( 1 ) pulls parallel to the internal spline or slide ( 8 ), the force applied on the pressure sensor ( 6 ) is essentially equivalent to the force exerted by the fishing line ( 1 ) and reel drag mechanism. FIG. 2 shows a visual line tension warning device ( 3 ) and an audible line tension warning device ( 4 ) placed in the forward grip ( 11 ). These devices warn the user when the line tension exceeds the line tension threshold as set by the user. FIG. 3 is a perspective view detailing the internal construction of the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. The numbering of the individual parts are the same as in FIG. 2. FIG. 3 depicts the fishing pole handle with the butt ( 10 in FIG. 2 ) removed. The sliding reel seat ( 7 ) slides on the internal spline or slide ( 8 ). The sliding reel seat ( 7 ) has a contact point ( 12 ) which applies pressure to the pressure sensor ( 6 ) when the handle is in its normal configuration. FIG. 4 is a perspective view detailing the internal construction of the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. The numbering of the individual parts are the same as in FIG. 2. FIG. 4 shows the fishing pole handle with the sliding reel seat and reel ( 7 &amp; 9 in FIG. 2 ) removed for clarity. FIG. 5 is a perspective view detailing the construction of the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. The numbering of the individual parts are the same as in FIG. 2. FIG. 5 shows the sliding reel mount and reel ( 7 &amp; 9 ). The internal spline or slide ( 8 ) allows the sliding reel mount ( 7 ) contact point ( 12 ) to apply pressure on the pressure sensor ( 6 in FIG. 2 ). For clarity, the reel clamps on the sliding reel mount have not been shown. They are of the standard twist lock type, well known to those skilled in the art. The actual method of attaching the reel to the sliding reel mount is not material to the invention. FIG. 6 is a perspective view detailing the electronics package of the preferred embodiment of the fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. The electronics package contains the control buttons ( 13 ), battery cover ( 14 ), and data jack ( 15 ). The actual electronics are inside the electronics package and not shown. The batteries (internal, not shown) supply the power to the pressure sensor ( 6 ), electronics (internal, not shown), display ( 2 ) and warnings ( 3 , 4 ). In this embodiment, the line tension display ( 2 ) is a liquid crystal display commonly called an LCD. The line tension visual warning ( 3 ) is a light emitting diode commonly called an LED. The line tension audible warning ( 4 ) is a piezo buzzer. The data jack ( 15 ) allows the connection of other electronic equipment to the pressure sensor output. In this embodiment, the data jack ( 15 ) provides an analog voltage output proportional to the pressure applied to the pressure sensor ( 6 ). The control buttons ( 13 ) control the modes of operation of the display ( 2 ) and warning indicators ( 3 , 4 ). The modes of operation of the preferred embodiment are: Setup, real-time tension, maximum tension, and threshold sensing. Setup mode controls the display and warning parameters. The display ( 2 ) can be configured to show pounds or kilograms. Setup allows the user to specify a line tension threshold in the selected units. Setup allows the user to activate or de-activate the line tension threshold alarms. Real-time mode displays the current line tension on the display ( 2 ) in the selected units, pounds or kilograms. Maximum tension mode holds and displays the maximum tension in the selected units. Pressing either control button while in maximum tension mode resets the maximum tension hold register to 0. Maximum tension mode would be used to set the drag on the fishing reel. The user would pull the line from the reel until the reel drag slipped. The display would show the maximum amount of line tension applied by the reel drag. Threshold sensing mode monitors the line tension and activates the audible ( 4 ) and visual ( 3 ) warnings if the measured line tension exceeds the set threshold. Pressing either control button when the alarms are activated turns off the alarms. Threshold sensing could be used to detect fish biting, or detect fouling of lures or hooks while fishing or trolling. FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing the preferred embodiment of a reel seat with integrated line tension measuring device according to the invention. Integrating the measuring device into a self contained reel seat mechanism reduces the complexity of building a fishing pole with an integrated line tension measuring device. During fabrication of fishing poles, the reel seat is slid onto the fishing rod blank and permanently affixed to the handle end of the rod. The complete reel seat mechanism as depicted in FIG. 7 can be fixed to the blank in the identical fashion, thereby simplifying production of a fishing pole with integrated line tension measuring device. In FIG. 7 the reel seat with integrated line tension measuring device is shown on the rod blank ( 11 ). The reel seat consist of a sliding reel mount ( 7 ), pressure sensor ( 6 ), electronics ( 5 ), line tension display and warnings ( 2 , 3 , 4 ), internal spline or slide ( 8 ), and lock nut ( 10 ) at the end of the spline or slide. The lock nut ( 10 ) controls the length of travel for the sliding reel mount ( 7 ). The lock nut ( 10 ) is adjusted to keep the reel mount ( 7 ) very close to the pressure sensor ( 6 ). The reel ( 9 ) is connected to the sliding reel mount ( 7 ) in the standard fashion. The reel ( 9 ) is solidly affixed to the sliding reel mount ( 7 ) and they move together as a single unit. The sliding reel mount ( 7 ) is mounted on an internal spline or slide ( 8 ) which allows the reel/reel mount body ( 7 , 9 ) to move in the longitudinal direction along the long axis of the pole. Rotation is prevented by the internal spline or slide ( 8 )."

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention relates generally to the artful killing of animals and more particularly to terminating rodents, including rats, utilizing novel improvements to conventional snap-traps and the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Rodents are pervasive pests when it comes to agricultural products. It is estimated there are over one billion rats on poultry and agriculture farms that cause approximately 15 billion U.S. dollars worth of economic damage. In urban and suburban areas there is estimated to be one rat per human. These animals cause fires by gnawing on wires, they pollute foodstuffs, and they carry disease such as salmonellosis and leplospirosis. [0003] Rats come in all different shapes and sizes. The most common rats are the Norwegian rat ( rattus norwegicus ) or the common roof rat ( Rattus rattus ). They range in size from 10 oz to 16 oz. The normal ways of exterminating or removing common rats are snap traps, live animal traps, electronic sonic disturbance, poison baits, and glue pads. Snap traps tend to have low success level for killing rats. Because of rats&#39; large size, many times the rats will run off with the trap attached to them. Other cases, the rat may be trapped under the wire jaws of the snap trap and squirm and fight for survival for many hours and finally succeed in prying themselves loose. One problem with the fight for survival is that after fighting with the trap for several hours it will frequently leave blood or other body fluids on the trap from their appendages and orifices. Once blood gets on the traps, they will need to be cleaned since the other rats will smell the residual fluids and avoid the trap altogether. Live animal traps are humane traps but the animal is not exterminated and must be disposed of in another area or killed by some other means. The electronic sonic repellants merely ward off the animals to areas outside the offending sonic disturbance. Poison baits are efficient in their killing of the rodents but the poisoned animals may wander off to die and cause odors from their decay. Further, the deceased poisoned rodents and the poison baits can be ingested by other domesticated animals, and such poison baits can present a danger to children. Glue traps are effective but many question their humane killing of the rodent because the animals usually die from dehydration after long struggles. Methods of trapping and exterminating that are efficient and humane have generally not been widely available. [0004] Conventional snap traps generally comprise a wire bail that is cocked on a spring and held in place by another wire or by some latching system on a base made of wood or other suitable rigid material. The bait area has either a triggering plate or a platform that the animal triggers when it steps on it to retrieve the bait, or the bait is on a catch mechanism that slides the wire bail holder, triggering the forceful movement of the wire bail. Once triggered the wire bail forcefully strikes the animal in the bait zone, sometimes killing it, and often merely wounding it. The lack of a killing strike allows the animal to pry itself out of the trap and escape or to inhumanely squirm and fight until it dies from exhaustion or dehydration. Improvements upon the snap trap usually come in the form of the triggering mechanism such as a trigger platform as seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,464,559 and 5,375,367. Other improvements relate to the cocking mechanism to make it safer for the user to bring the bail back to a set position as seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,574,519 and 4,711,049. Another patent similar to snap traps is a jaw clip type trap seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,508,031, resembling a hair clip, in which the user sets the jaws apart with the bait inside and the animal triggers the jaws when interacting with the bait. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] One or more of the embodiments of the invention provide improvements upon the general type of snap traps in order to kill the trapped animal and leave a bloodless kill zone. These embodiments can be used on any suitable animal, rodents, and more specifically rats, and are a primary focus of the embodiments described herein. [0006] In an embodiment of the invention the kill zone, also called the animal staging area, is surrounded on three sides by generally rigid upright flanges. These upright flanges are usually rectangular and relatively thin. The flanges are set on the staging area in such a way that the animal&#39;s head must protrude over the flange in order to get to the bait. After triggering, the spring loaded wire bail will strike the animal about the dorsal area of the neck and shoulders driving the animal&#39;s ventral neck onto the flange causing the animal to expire almost immediately. Without further exploring the death, expiration is likely caused by either breaking of the spinal column thus severing nerves or breaking of the tracheal area causing blockage and suffocation of the animal. The quick death of the animal foregoes the struggling and maiming of the animal which often happens in current snap traps and, at the same time, results a bloodless kill zone. [0007] The upright flanges may be fully integrated into the snap trap itself when it is manufactured, or they could be a retro-fit structure for commercially available traps. [0008] Another embodiment of the invention is a snap trap kit that includes, optionally, a snap trap, a removable life terminating engagement area, appropriate attachment means, optionally some animal bait, and optionally an animal disposal bag.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0018] In the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to an artisan of ordinary skill that the present invention may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. In other instances, specific features, or measurements well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. Although examples of the invention are set forth herein, the claims and the full scope of any equivalents are what define the metes and bounds of the invention. [0019] In describing the invention and embodiments, the following terms will be employed and are intended to be defined as indicated below. If any terms are not fully defined, then the normal usage as used in the art will fill any gaps in the understanding of the terminology. [0020] As used in this specification and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. [0021] The use of the word \u201cpreferably\u201d in its various forms is explanatory for ease of reading, and should not be used to read into the claims as limiting or anything more. [0022] \u201cHumane\u201d as used herein is the ethical killing of animals in a swift manner, usually instantaneously or in a very short time, preferably less than a minute. [0023] \u201cBloodless\u201d is considered where the struck animal or expired animal does not secrete blood from parts, appendages, or orifices thus leaving the trap sufficiently free of blood or other body fluids. [0024] \u201cLife terminating engagement surface\u201d (LTES) is any raised surface from the trap&#39;s base that the targeted animal body engages to effect a killing [0025] \u201cSet Position\u201d is when the wire bail is pulled against the coiled springs into a cocked position where the wire bail is resting on or near the base of trap on the opposite side of the base from the bait. It is held there by either a holding wire set onto a friction fit of a baitable catch or by some other means. [0026] \u201cStrike position\u201d is when the wire bail is released from the set position and is forced down onto the animal staging area or kill zone. [0027] The \u201ckill zone\u201d area of the trap, also known as the staging area, is the location in which the animal is engaged by the wire bail and the life terminating engagement surface causes a death blow. [0028] \u201cTrigger platform\u201d is an area of the trap located in the animal staging area that the target animal engages and triggers the wire bail to move to the strike position. [0029] \u201cFixable\u201d as used in the disclosure and the claims is having the ability to make fast, firm, or stable. Or to be able to be placed definitely and more or less permanently. Though something is said to be fixable it could be removed, exchanged, or modified. For example, if the LTES was molded onto the trap then it would not be considered fixable and not removable. Furthering the example, if the LTES was attached by means of screws then it would be considered fixable and could possibly be removed. [0030] Referring to the embodiment of FIG. 1 , conventional commercially available snap trap 9 has a rectangular base 10 made of material such as wood, metal, veneer, pressboard, plywood, plastic, or a composite, among others. Rectangular wire bail 12 may be attached on base 10 by means of staples 16. The wire bail is of conventional commercially available material such as heavy steel. Dual coil springs 13 a and 13 b are wrapped around the attached end of the wire bail. Springs 13 a and 13 b are coiled with their pressure ends 9 a, 9 b, and 19 a, 19 b pressed against base 10 toward the middle of the wire bail and on both elongated sides of wire bail 12 , respectively. Holding wire 11 may be attached to base 10 with staple 17. Holding wire 11 will hold wire bail 12 in the set position when the wire bail is pivoted against the pressure of the coiled springs with the end of the holding wire 11 set onto a pressure or tension fit with baitable catch 15 , which is also known as a baiting mechanism in this and other embodiments. FIG. 1 shows holding wire 11 in the set position, engaging baitable catch 15 and holding wire bail 12 in a high tension position. Catch 15 may be attached to the base 10 by any effective means, such as staple 18. Animal staging area 20 is the area also known as the \u201ckill zone\u201d which encompasses the end of base 10 in which wire bail 12 touches the base 10 when it is fully sprung, a position also known as the strike position. The fully sprung wire bail in the strike position is shown in FIG. 2 (and again in FIG. 8 ). The above is a general description of a conventional mouse or rat trap. [0031] At the end of base 10 , in the vicinity of the kill zone, are life terminating engagement surfaces (LTES) comprised of upright flanges 22 a, 22 b, and 22 c. It is contemplated that the upright flanges can be individually attached or molded onto base 10 , or molded together to be attached or molded to base 10 as shown in FIG. 6. An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 5 and will be discussed below. Preferably upright flanges 22 a - 22 c are arranged at about 90 degrees with respect to each other, generally following the rectangular shape of wire bail 12. Other useful shapes and configurations of the upright flanges are contemplated as long as they effect the killing of the targeted animal. It is contemplated that each individual flange, or the flanges as a group, will have profile shapes that can be rectangular, polygonal, ellipsoidal or any shape that effect a killing blow. The shape of the flanges as a group are contemplated to include the U-shape shown, or various polygonal or rounded shapes that integrate into kill zone 20 such that bail 12 strikes the animal forcing it down upon an upright flange 22 a - 22 c in a killing manner. The bail itself may have a shape other than rectangular, to which the flanges can be matched. [0032] The upright flanges are contemplated to stand at an angle between 65 degrees and 115 degrees, preferably between 85 and 95 degrees and most preferably at 90 degrees with respect to base 10. Any angle that effects a killing upon the animal is contemplated. [0033] The height of upright flanges 22 a - 22 c is contemplated to be between about 0.25 inch and about 0.75 inch, preferably about 0.50 inch. The length of the upright flanges is approximately 2 inches, though any length that coordinates with the wire bail to effect a killing is contemplated. The distance between fully sprung wire bail 12 and the upright flanges is preferably less than 0.25 inch, more preferably within about 0.125 inch. [0034] The life terminating engagement surface should be only as sharp as to not allow cutting into the target animal&#39;s flesh. The thickness of the engagement surface should be between 0.0313 inch and 0.125 inch, preferably about 0.0625 inch. Attaching the upright flanges to base 10 may be effected by screws 23 a - 23 d as seen in FIGS. 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 , or by nuts and bolts, polymer adhesives and glues, hook and clasp fasteners, pressure fit, groove guides, snap locks, or other effective chemical or mechanical attachment means and the like. [0035] The method of killing shown by this embodiment comprises the steps of, first, setting the trap by: a) applying any suitable bait to baitable catch 15 , possibly with some animal attractant in addition to the bait; b) cocking wire bail 12 by pivoting it against the tension of springs 13 a and 13 b; and c) placing holding wire 11 over wire bail 12 and engaging it with the releasable retainer on catch 15. This is conventional for setting a trap of this type. Optionally, if the LTES is not in place before setting the trap, the various embodiments of LTES can be attached to the trap preliminary to setting the trap. The trap is sprung mechanically by disengaging the baitable catch from holding wire 11 through an attracted target animal&#39;s interaction with the catch. Death results from suddenly striking the animal&#39;s dorsal side in the neck or upper shoulders with wire bail 12 , forcing the animal&#39;s ventral throat against the life-terminating engagement surface, causing a quick death. In some embodiments the wire bail, when in the strike position in the kill zone, can be positioned or oriented to the exterior of the LTES as seen in FIGS. 1 and 4 or in other embodiments to the interior of the LTES as seen in FIG. 7. In this FIG. 7 alternative embodiment the height of the flanges 22 a and 22 c are reduced if and as necessary to accommodate the ends of spring pressure ends 19 a and 19 b. [0036] This method of trapping and killing of rodents is superior to the way conventional snap traps function, as seen in Chart 1, based on experimental evidence. [0037] Chart 1. Rat Kill/Escape ratio comparison (n=10) [0000] Trap Killed Escaped Percent Killed Snap trap without LTES 4 6 40 Snap trap with LTES 10 0 100 [0038] This chart represents an easy test comparison of a snap trap without the life terminating engagement surfaces of this invention and a snap trap with the subject LTES. Of the ten rats that were exposed to the trap without the LTES, only 4 were killed when the trap was sprung on them, possibly after an extended struggle, and six escaped, possibly significantly injured. Of the ten rats that were exposed to the trap with LTES, all ten were killed relatively quickly without any appreciable blood found on the trap. None escaped. [0039] Embodiments of the invention are contemplated in which the life terminating engagement surfaces are, for example, molded, attached individually, or attached as a molded group onto the trap base in the animal staging area. [0040] In an embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 5 , removable sleeve 21 including LTES is contemplated to be made out of any suitable material such as metal, plastic, wood, or a composite. Any method of manufacture and shape is contemplated that would be useful for the style of trap. On the upper surface of removable sleeve 21 , in a square bottomed \u201cU\u201d shape, are the LTES that, in this embodiment, are fixable upright flanges 22 a, 22 b and 22 c. Any attachment means suitable for the purposes of attaching the sleeve onto a trap are contemplated, with examples such as self tapping screws, nuts and bolts, polymer adhesives and glues, hook and clasp fasteners, pressure fit, groove guides, snap locks, or other effective chemical or mechanical attachment means and the like."

In one configuration rooted in current advancements, this bioadhesive assembly is comprised of a conformable backbone with an array of bioadhesive units arrayed along its length. The backbone transitions between a straightened state for insertion and a curved state conforming to tissue structures. The versatile backbone is crafted from a composite substance capable of remembering shapes, changing from an insertion form to a tissue-conforming shape upon temperature variation. This technology accelerates the application procedure, making navigation through tight biological structures more manageable. A series of biologically compatible adhesive elements are spaced precisely on the conformable backbone. In deployment, each unit applies a medical-grade adhesive, gently becoming affixed to the targeted tissues, resulting in an intimate and secure bond. The inventive solution is a boon for minimally invasive surgeries, as it negates the need for extensive surgical incisions, reduces risk, and promotes rapid patient recovery.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/978,754, filed on Oct. 9, 2007, entitled \u201cMAGNETIC ANASTOMOSIS DEVICE HAVING IMPROVED DELIVERY\u201d FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to magnetic anastomosis devices for forming an anastomosis between two viscera. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Magnetic anastomosis devices (MADs) are currently used to create a channel between two viscera for the purpose of redirecting bodily fluids. For example, intestinal contents or bile may be redirected in patients who have developed an obstruction of the bowel or bile duct due to such conditions as tumor, ulcer, inflammatory strictures or trauma. With reference to FIG. 1 , the relative positions of several organs of the abdominal cavity are shown, including the gall bladder 10 , the common bile duct 12 , the stomach 14 , the duodenum 16 and the jejunum 18 of the small intestine. Inflammatory strictures 20 , 22 of the jejunum 18 and bowel duct 12 are shown by the dotted lines in FIG. 1. [0004] A magnetic anastomosis device (MAD) 30 has been depicted in FIG. 2 , the details of which may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,656, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generally, the MAD 30 includes first and second magnet assemblies 30 a, 30 b comprising magnetic cores 36 a, 36 b which are surrounded by thin metal rims 38 a, 38 b. Due to the magnetic attraction between the two magnetic cores 36 a, 36 b, the walls 32 , 34 of two adjacent viscera may be sandwiched and compressed between the magnet assemblies 30 a , 30 b, resulting in ischemic necrosis of the walls 32 , 34 to produce an anastamosis between the two viscera. With reference back to FIG. 1 , the two viscera may comprise the jejunum 18 and the stomach 14 , the bowel duct 12 and the duodenum 16 , or various other combinations. [0005] Historically, MADs have been delivered through surgical intervention such as laparotomy, which of course is invasive and carries its own risks. The exemplary self-centering MAD of U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,656 permit delivery of the device over a wire guide and through the oral cavity, and typically under fluoroscopy. Alternatively, delivery can be accomplished by simply swallowing the magnet assemblies of the MAD and using massage under fluoroscopy to center the two magnet assemblies. Finally, delivery of the magnet assemblies has occasionally been performed endoscopically with grasping forceps, which can be time consuming and difficult. Removal of the MAD is typically accomplished allowing the magnet assemblies to pass through the gastrointestinal track naturally, or more typically with a follow-up endoscopic procedure using grasping forceps. Unfortunately, the relatively large size of the magnet assemblies can make delivery and retrieval complicated. In fact, balloon dilation of bodily lumens is often required in order to deliver the magnet assemblies to the desired location. Likewise, the size of bodily lumens is often the limiting factor in the size of the magnet assemblies that can be delivered and deployed. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention provides a magnet assembly for a magnetic anastamosis device that is minimally invasive, easily and quickly delivered, and is accurately positioned to improve the delivery procedure. According to one embodiment constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a magnet assembly for a magnetic anastamosis device includes an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. The elongated hub is formed of a shape memory material, permitting the magnet assembly to be operable between a delivery configuration and a deployed configuration. In the delivery configuration, the elongated hub extends generally linearly, and in the deployed configuration the elongated hub forms an annular shape. In this manner, the package width of the magnet assembly is greatly reduced for delivery, thereby permitting delivery over a wire guide as well as through an access device such as a catheter. [0007] According to more detailed aspects, the elongated hub is formed of a nickel titanium alloy. The elongated hub is preferably tubular and defines an inner passageway sized to receive the wire guide. The plurality of magnetic members may abut each other in the deployed configuration. Each of the plurality of magnetic members includes a hole sized to receive the elongated hub, and each hole may be sized to permit the magnetic member to slide along the elongated hub, or may be sized to provide a friction fit. In the former case, the elongated hub includes a stop formed at one end of the elongated hub to prevent the plurality of magnetic members from passing beyond the end. Alternatively, the plurality of magnetic members and elongated hub may include corresponding tabs and detents or other means for maintaining the position of the magnetic members on the elongated hub. In one form, the plurality of magnetic members each include a jacket attached to a side thereof, each jacket projecting beyond the sides to define an edge. Each edge may contact the edges of adjacent jackets to form a continuous annular \u201ccutting\u201d edge in the deployed configuration. [0008] Another embodiment constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention provides a medical device for forming an anastamosis between two bodily walls, the medical device comprising a magnet assembly and an access device. The magnet assembly has an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. The access device is structured to be coupled to the magnet assembly. The magnet assembly is biased to a deployed configuration defined by the elongated hub and plurality of magnetic members forming an annular shape. When the magnet assembly is coupled to the access device, the magnet assembly assumes a delivery configuration defined by the elongated hub and plurality of members having a generally linear configuration. According to more detailed aspects, the elongated hub is formed of a resilient material biased to the deployed configuration. Alternatively, the elongated hub is formed of a shaped memory material which takes the deployed configuration when the elongated hub is exposed to body temperature. [0009] A method of delivering a magnet assembly that is part of a magnetic anastamosis device is also provided in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. A magnet assembly is provided having an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. An access device is introduced to a position proximate a first bodily wall. The magnet assembly is coupled to the access device such that the magnet assembly assumes a delivery configuration having a generally linear shape. The magnet assembly is translated relative to the access device whereby the magnet assembly assumes a deployed configuration having a generally annular shape.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025] Turning now to the figures, FIG. 3 depicts a single magnet assembly 40 for a magnetic anastomosis device that is used to form an anastomosis between two viscera. The magnet assembly 40 generally comprises an elongated hub 42 and a plurality of magnetic members 44 disposed over the elongated hub 42. The deployed configuration of the magnet assembly 40 is depicted in FIG. 3 , wherein the elongated hub 42 and the plurality of magnetic members 44 form an annular shape having an interior space 43. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the magnet assembly 40 may be used in conjunction with another magnet assembly of larger or smaller size to form the magnetic anastamosis device (i.e. similar to that depicted in FIG. 2.) To improve delivery of the magnet assembly 40 , the magnet assembly is operable to a delivery configuration as depicted in FIG. 6. In the delivery configuration, the magnet assembly 40 has a reduced width, making it easier to pass through bodily lumens. [0026] To achieve the delivery and deployed configurations of the magnet assembly 40 , the elongated hub 42 is structured to transition between a linear condition as depicted in FIG. 4 and an annular condition such as the circular shape depicted in FIG. 5. As such, the elongated hub 42 may be constructed of a resilient material which is biased to the annular condition depicted in FIG. 5 but may be flexed and straightened into the linear condition depicted in FIG. 4. Suitable resilient materials include metals (e.g. stainless steel), alloys (e.g. nickel-titanium) or polymers (e.g. polyethylene, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) including Teflon\u00ae, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)), and composites. Alternatively, the elongated hub 42 may be formed of a shape memory material such as nickel-titanium alloys (Nitinol), copper-aluminum-nickel, copper-zinc-aluminum, and iron-manganese-silicon alloys. That is, the shape memory material of the elongated hub 42 is structured to take the linear condition of FIG. 4 at a first temperature, and moves into the annular condition of FIG. 5 at a second temperature. The second temperature preferably corresponds to body temperature of the patient, or above body temperature but below tissue harming temperature, so that one can freely maneuver the device inside the body, and then inject a hot fluid over the device to trigger the shape memory. It will be recognized that the linear condition of the elongated hub 42 corresponds with the delivery configuration of the magnet assembly 40 ( FIG. 6 ) while the annular condition of the elongated hub 42 corresponds to the deployed configuration of the magnet assembly 40 ( FIG. 3 ). [0027] As best seen in FIG. 4 , the elongated hub 42 is preferably formed as a tube 46 defining an interior passageway 48 which is sized to receive an access device such as a wire guide 50. For example, the wire guide 50 may be used to maintain the linear condition of the elongated hub 42 when it is constructed of a resilient material that is biased to the annular condition ( FIG. 5 ). In either construction of the elongated hub 42 (i.e. biased or shape memory), the ability to couple the elongated hub 46 and magnet assembly 40 to a wire guide 50 is useful in navigating the magnet assembly 40 to the desired location for forming the anastomosis. For example, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the wire guide 50 may include radiopaque markers permitting tracking of the distal tip of the wire guide 50 such that the delivery point of the magnet assembly 40 may be readily and easily monitored by the physician under fluoroscopy. [0028] Turning to FIG. 6 , it will be recognized that an alternate access device such as a catheter or cannula 54 may be used to maintain the magnet assembly 40 in its delivery configuration, while also providing access to the desired location within the viscera on which the procedure will be formed. The cannula 54 defines an interior space 55 receiving the magnet assembly 40 therein. A pusher 56 may be used to translate the magnet assembly 40 within the cannula 54 or simply to maintain its position therein. As with the wire guide 50 , the cannula 54 may include radiopaque markers 57 permitting tracking of the access device under feroscopy for accurate positioning of the magnet assembly 40. It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that the cannula 54 may be used alone or in conjunction with a wire guide 50 for navigation of the bodily lumens and delivery of the magnet assembly 40. [0029] As also seen in FIG. 6 , the plurality of magnetic members 44 are axially spaced along the elongated hub 42. In particular, each magnetic member 44 is located on the exterior of the elongated hub 42 and includes a hole 52 sized to receive the elongated hub 42. Turning to FIG. 7 , a few of the numerous ways in which the magnetic members 44 may be coupled to the elongated hub 42 have been depicted. By way of example, magnetic member 44 a includes a hole 52 a which is sized larger than an outer diameter of the elongated hub 42 and thus is axially translatable therealong. The magnetic member 44 b has been shown as soldered to the elongated hub 42 , although numerous related means such as welding or adhesives may also be employed. The magnetic member 44 c includes a protective coating 58 which may be formed of various materials such as polymers like Teflon\u00ae or Paralene\u00ae for protection of the magnetic core from the corrosive effects of digestive acids or other bodily fluids depending upon the body structure involved. It will also be recognized that the magnetic member 44 c depicts a friction fit with the elongated hub 42 , which may be employed regardless of whether the coating 58 is used. Finally, magnetic member 44 d depicts a corresponding detent 60 and tab 62 which may be formed on the hub 42 and magnetic member 44 d. [0030] The magnet assembly 40 as depicted in FIGS. 3-7 has a general ring or disc shape (i.e. having an axial height which is less than the outer diameter of the magnetic member 44 ) which may be circular, oval or ovoid, square or the like, and it will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that the magnetic members 44 may take numerous sizes and shapes, a few of which have been depicted in FIGS. 8-12. The magnetic member 44 e of FIG. 8 has been depicted as generally cubular. The magnetic member 44 f of FIG. 9 has been depicted as generally cylindrical. The magnetic member 44 g of FIG. 10 has been depicted as polygonal and specifically hexagonal, while also being elongated. The magnetic member 44 h of FIG. 11 has been depicted as a generally trapezoidal body, the trapezoidal shape existing in a plane generally parallel to the elongated hub 42. The trapezoidal shape is denoted by a radially inner side 64 which is smaller in length than a larger radially outer side 66. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the trapezoidal shape of magnetic member 44 h, as well as related wedge or pie shapes, has particular usefulness when a continuous upper or lower surface of the magnet assembly 40 is desired. That is, the angled side surfaces 65 will abut adjacent side surfaces 65 of the neighboring magnetic members 44 h. As such, the angling of side surface 65 and the relative sizes of opposing surfaces 64 , 66 may be selected depending upon the number of magnetic members 44 h and the radius of the annular deployed configuration ( FIG. 3 ). Finally, the magnetic member 44 i of FIG. 12 is formed as an oblong bead. Numerous other shapes of the magnetic members 44 may be readily envisioned by those skilled in the art. [0031] As shown in FIGS. 13 , 14 and 15 , each magnetic member 44 may be designed to have its magnetic north and south poles divided by virtually any plane. For example, in FIG. 13 the north portion 70 and south portion 72 of the magnetic member 44 has been separated along a transverse plane (indicated by dotted line), generally perpendicular to the axis of the elongated hub 42. In FIG. 14 , each magnetic member 44 has its north portion 74 and south portion 76 divided along an annular plane (indicated by dotted line), generally parallel to the axis of the elongated hub 42. It will also be recognized that in the embodiment of FIG. 14 , when the magnetic members 44 are permitted to slide axially over the elongated hub 42 , a stop 68 may be formed at the ends of the elongated hub 42 to keep the magnetic members 44 disposed over the elongated hub 42.

  "pos": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 856,609, filed Apr. 25, 1986, now abandoned which application continuation-in-part of the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 615,361, filed May 30, 1984, now abandoned the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to oral artificial ventilation apparatus, and more particularly to apparatus which includes means for protecting the rescuer or individual administering oral artificial ventilation from contracting diseases carried by the victim or person to whom artificial ventilation is administered. 2. Description of the Prior Art The widespread use of artificial respiration or artificial oral ventilation techniques, also referred to as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, is well known in the medical arts, both for field use and in emergency rooms. The mouth-to-mouth technique is used alone or in combination with cardiac massage, this combination being known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Emergency medical personnel and emergency rescue personnel must take victims in need of artificial ventilation as they find them and unfortunately, whether or not these individuals carry viral or bacterial diseases is frequently unknown. It is highly desirable to permit life saving oral resuscitation techniques, but it is also highly desirable to protect the personnel administering such techniques from possible infectious disease. Similar problems are encountered in training exercise where health care workers practice artificial oral ventilation techniques using mannikins or training devices such as that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,068,590. Disease organisms carried by one worker can be transferred to the mannikin and possibly from the mannikin to subsequent workers using the mannikin for training. As used herein, the terms &#34;victim&#34; and &#34;subject&#34; should be understood as including both actual human patients and training mannikins or devices simulating the human patient. Typically, such training devices have face, lip and nose portions configured to match those of a typical human being. Artificial ventilation apparatus presently known include those of the type generally represented by U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,995,131 to Elam; and 3,006,337 to Aquado. A shortcoming of these devices is that they provide essentially no barrier between the victim and the medical personnel and infectious disease can be readily transmitted when these devices are employed. Partial solutions to the aforenoted problem are provided by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,395,700 to Stillman and 3,407,810 to Waldrep. Stillman employs an air passage which allows air being exhaled by the victim to pass through the device without being inhaled by the administering individual. Waldrep utilizes a long tube with a mouth piece for the rescuer at one end and a &#34;saliva trap&#34; at the opposite end for insertion into the victim&#39;s mouth. However, neither Stillman nor Waldrep provides means for protecting the rescuer or administering individual from air exhaled through the victim&#39;s nostrils. The problem of providing acceptable oral artificial ventilation apparatus for protecting the rescuer is complicated by the difficult and demanding environment in which such apparatus must function. Typically, the rescuer is preoccupied with urgent tasks such as administration of cardiac massage and administration of first aid for the victim&#39;s injuries in addition to administration of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, all of which tasks require urgent attention. Accordingly, artificial oral ventilation apparatus must be exceedingly simple to use, and should not require attention during the procedure. The apparatus should not cause additional risk to the patient. For example, real human victims often regurgitate during resuscitation attempts. The oral artificial ventilation apparatus should not cause injury to the patient in the event of regurgitation. Moreover, humans have widely varying facial characteristics. Preferably, an oral artificial ventilation apparatus should be adaptable to a wide range of facial configurations so that a few standardized devices or, most preferably, one standardized device can be carried by rescue workers and employed with any victim. Also, the apparatus should be low in cost so that it can be used once and discarded, and so that the devices can be economically stocked in rescue workers&#39; supply kits. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a disposable oral artificial ventilation apparatus which protects the administering individual from bacterial and viral germs of a victim or training mannikin. Another object of the present invention is to provide an oral artificial ventilation apparatus which deflects air exhaled from the nostrils of the victim so that is is not blown into the face of the rescuer or administering individual. A further object of the present invention is to provide an oral artificial ventilation apparatus which can be readily placed in position on a victim. Still another further object of the present invention is to provide a disposable oral artificial ventilation apparatus which includes no complex structure or precision moving parts. Another object of the present invention is to provide a disposable oral artificial ventilation apparatus which is simple in design, relatively inexpensive to manufacture, rugged in construction, easy to sterilize and easy to use, and efficient in operation. Further objects of the present invention, best realized by apparatus according to particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, are to provide oral artificial ventilation apparatus which can be securely engaged with the face of a living, human victim even if the facial features of the victim differ significantly in size and/or shape from those of the normal or &#34;average&#34; person. Yet another object of this aspect of the present invention is to provide such secure engagement while also permitting automatic release of the apparatus from the victim&#39;s face in the event of regurgitation, thereby to avoid blockage of the victim&#39;s respiratory tract by vomitus. A still further object according to this additional aspect of the present invention is to provide oral artificial ventilation apparatus which permits the victim to exhale through his mouth, as well as through his nose. Oral artificial ventilation apparatus according one aspect of the present invention includes an air and liquid impervious shield or elongate member adapted to overlie the mouth and adjacent areas of the face of the subject. Thus, the shield is of sufficient size to cover the mouth and adjacent areas of the face. Directions and orientations of elements of the apparatus are described in this disclosure with reference to directions on the shield or elongate member. Thus, the shield member may be said to define distal and proximal directions opposite to one another, upward and downward directions opposite to one another and orthogonal to the distal and proximal directions, and two lateral directions opposite to one another and orthogonal to both the distal/proximal directions and the upward/downward directions. The shield or elongate member has two opposite surfaces, which may be referred to herein as the &#34;distal&#34; and &#34;proximal&#34; surfaces. The distal surface, facing generally in the distal direction, is adapted to overlie and contact the mouth and face of the subject. Typically, the distal surface has a contour substantially complementary to the contour of the lips and surrounding facial region of a typical human being. Stated another way, the distal surface may be substantially in the form of a negative relief image of the lips and surrounding regions of a typical human face. When the apparatus is in use on a victim or subject, the shield or elongate member is juxtaposed with the subject&#39;s face so that distal surface of the shield faces toward the patient. In this orientation, the directions along the shield or elongate member correspond to the directions defined by the victim&#39;s face, i.e., the upward direction on the shield is the direction towards the top of the victim, whereas the lateral directions correspond to the directions away from the center line of the victim&#39;s face and towards the sides of the victim&#39;s head. The shield or elongate member has a substantially central opening formed therein, the opening being adapted for disposal over the mouth of the subject. Thus, the opening extends through the distal surface at a location between the features of the distal surface corresponding to the victim&#39;s lips. One-way normally closed valve means are operatively associated with the central opening for controlling flow through the central opening. Thus, the valve means are operative to open in response to air flow from the rescuer directed in the distal direction, through the central opening, to permit passage of air to the mouth of the subject through the central opening, but the valve means are also operative to prevent escape of substances from the mouth of the subject through the central opening. Thus, air and disease orgasms expelled from the victim&#39;s mouth upon exhalation cannot pass back through the central opening to the rescuer&#39;s mouth. Preferably, the valve means includes an extended portion projecting from the distal or patient-side face of the shield or elongate member. This extended portion of the valve means projects into the victim&#39;s mouth when the apparatus is in use. The apparatus also includes air deflector means, most preferably formed as an integral portion of the shield or elongate member for extending to and covering the top of the nose of the subject but not blocking the nostrils of the subject so as to deflect air expelled from the nostrils of the subject away from the rescuer or individual administering artificial oral ventilation. Thus, apparatus according to this aspect of the present invention obviates the shortcomings of the prior art by providing oral artificial ventilation apparatus which not only precludes the flow of air and disease organisms from the victim to the rescuer via the victim&#39;s mouth and the central opening, but which also serves as a barrier against disease transmission by air exhaled from the victim&#39;s nostrils. According to a further aspect of the present invention, bias means may be provided for engaging the face of the subject or victim and biasing the shield member away from the victim&#39;s face. The bias means may include a pair of resilient elements connected to the shield member and protruding from the distal surface of the shield member on laterally opposite sides of the central opening. Each of the resilient elements may have a proximal end adjacent the shield and a distal end remote from the shield. The resilient elements preferably slope laterally outwardly, away from one another so that the distal ends of the resilient elements are further from one another then the proximal ends of the resilient elements. In use, the resilient elements can engage the regions of the victim&#39;s face adjacent the corners of the mouth. When the rescuer applies his mouth to the proximal side of the shield so as to blow air through the central opening into the victim&#39;s respiratory tract, the rescuer&#39;s lips force the shield member towards the victim&#39;s face and the resilient elements bend proximally, towards the shield member and also bend laterally outwardly. When the rescuer removes his lips from the apparatus, as when exhalation by the victim is desired, the resilient elements recover and hence lift the shield member slightly away from the victim&#39;s lips. Accordingly, the shield member is maintained slightly away from the victim&#39;s lips during exhalation, so that air can pass out of the victim&#39;s respiratory tract through his mouth as well as through his nose. Air passing out of the victim&#39;s mouth is deflected away from the rescuer by the shield member. This mouth unblocking action occurs automatically, without any deliberate action by the rescuer. It affords a very significant safety advantage, inasmuch as the victim may continue to exhale even if his nasal passages are blocked. While the rescuer is bearing on the proximal surface of the mask and forcing air into the victim&#39;s respiratory tract, the resilient elements bear on the regions of the victim&#39;s face adjacent the corners of the mouth with appreciable pressure and hence maintain effective sealing engagement with those regions of the victim&#39;s face to prevent leakage of the air being forcibly administered by the rescuer. This is a significant advantage, inasmuch as the mouth-corner regions of the face typically are poorly supported by underlying bony structures when the victim&#39;s mouth is open and hence have posed difficult sealing problems heretofore. Moreover, the same resilient elements which serve to lift the shield member away from the victim&#39;s face to a limited extent during exhalation also serve to maintain secure engagement of the apparatus with the victim&#39;s face. The resilient elements bearing on the mouth-corner regions of the victim&#39;s face with laterally inwardly directed forces and hence serve as a gripper, tending to secure the apparatus against accidental dislodgement. Thus, the rescuer need not devote precious time and attention to reengaging the apparatus. Moreover, relatively secure engagement of the apparatus with the victim&#39;s face is provided without the need for elastic straps or the like in encircling the victim&#39;s head to hold the apparatus against the face. This not only provides a cost savings, but also a very significant safety advantage. With the moderate gripping action provided by the resilient elements, the apparatus can be dislodged by vomitus forcibly ejected through the victim&#39;s mouth upon regurgitation, so that the apparatus will not force vomitus back into the victim&#39;s respiratory tract. These objects, as well as further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following description of the non-limiting illustrative embodiments set forth below, taken with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In order that the present invention may be fully understood, it will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing in which: FIG. 1 is a pictorial representation of an oral artificial ventilation apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention in a use position on a victim. FIG. 2 is a pictorial representation of the oral artificial ventilation apparatus of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a side view of the oral artificial ventilation apparatus of FIGS. 1 and 2 in use on a victim. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the apparatus of FIG. 2 taken substantially along the lines A--A thereof showing the valve thereof in a closed position. FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the apparatus of FIG. 2 taken substantially along the lines A--A thereof with the valve thereof shown in an open position. FIG. 6 is a perspective representation of all artificial ventilation apparatus according to a further embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 7 and 8 are cross-sectional views of the apparatus depicted in FIG. 6 in two different positions occurring during use on a victim. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The ventilation apparatus includes a substantially oval shaped shield 12. The directions defined by shield 12 and used herein to describe positions and orientations of elements in the apparatus are indicated by the drawings. Thus, the distal direction defined by the shield member is the direction towards the bottom of the drawing sheet in FIGS. 3-5, whereas the proximal direction is the opposite direction, towards the top of the sheet in these figures. The upward direction is the direction towards the right in FIGS. 3-5 and towards the top of the sheet in FIGS. 1 and 2, whereas the downward direction is opposite. The lateral directions are the directions to the right and left in FIGS. 1 and 2. The shield or elongate member 12 has a distal face 13 (FIGS. 4 and 5) facing generally in the distal direction and a proximal surface 15 facing generally in the proximal direction. The shield 12 is contoured so that it substantially conforms to the contour of a human face. Thus, the distal surface 13 of the shield 12 has a shape substantially complementary to the contour of the lips and surrounding facial regions of a typical human being. For example, the distal surface includes recessed lip-receiving grooves or channels 17 and 19 (FIG. 4) corresponding to the protrusions of typical human lips. Shield member 12 also has a central opening 14 extending through the shield member adjacent the center of its proximal and distal faces. As best appreciated with reference to FIG. 4, opening 14 is disposed between the lip-receiving grooves 17 and 19. When the shield is juxtaposed with the face F of a victim, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 3, distal surface 13 confronts the lips and adjacent regions of the victim&#39;s face, and the contour features of the distal surface are aligned with the corresponding features of the victim&#39;s face. The victim&#39;s lips are disposed within the lip-receiving channels 17 and 19 and opening 14 is aligned with the victim&#39;s mouth. A duckbill valve assembly 16 is mounted at central opening 14. The duckbill valve assembly includes a hollow, tubular extended portion 21 protruding in the distal direction from the shield 12 and a pair of opposed flexible lips 20 and 22 at the distal end of the extended portion. Preferably, the entire duckbill valve assembly is formed integrally with shield 12. As best appreciated with reference to FIG. 3, the duckbill valve assembly 16 lodges within the victim&#39;s mouth when the shield is juxtaposed with the victim&#39;s face in use. An air deflector 18 is positioned at the upper edge of the shield 12. Preferably, air deflector 18 is formed integrally with shield 12 and constitutes an edge portion of the shield. The air deflector or edge portion 18 is canted relative to the general plane in which the shield 12 is disposed such that it fits above the nostrils of the victim when the shield 12 is in place on the face of the victim. As seen most clearly in FIGS. 4 and 5, air deflector 18 protrudes generally in the proximal direction from the shield 12, and the air deflector has a concave surface 23 facing away from central opening 14 and facing generally in the distal and upward directions, i.e., towards the bottom and right sides of the sheet in FIGS. 4 and 5. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the nasal deflector is arcuate and curves back towards the top of the head of the victim and above the tip of the nasal passages or nostrils."

This is accomplished using a non-polar media or low polar media with a dielectric constant less than about 60, stabilizing the active ingredient using complex carbohydrates or selected polysaccharides. The invention provides a syrup with enhanced stability and efficacy without the use of conventional alcohol stabilizers, thereby reducing potential safety concerns for certain patient populations, such as children, and optimizing the therapeutic effect for gastrointestinal treatments.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is generally related to alcohol free, liquid ranitidine formulations for oral administration. In particular, the present invention is related to stable, syrup formulations having ranitidine as an active ingredient for oral administration, processes for making the same, and methods of their use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ranitidine [N-[2-[[[5-(dimethylamino)methyl-2-furanyl]methyl]thio]ethyl]-N\u2032-methyl-2-nitro-1, 1-ethenediamine] and physiologically acceptable salts thereof (having, for example, the empirical formula C 13 H 22 N 4 O 3 S\u2014HCl and the structural Formula I shown below) are disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1565966. According to current prescribing information, the compound of Formula I is indicated for short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer (most patients found to heal within 4 weeks; studies available have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated duodenal ulcer for periods of more than 8 weeks); maintenance therapy for duodenal ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of acute ulcers (no placebo-controlled comparative studies have been carried out for periods of longer than 1 year); the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and systemic mastocytosis); short-term treatment of active, benign gastric ulcer (most patients found to heal within 6 weeks; the usefulness of further treatment has not been demonstrated; studies available have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated, benign gastric ulcer for periods of more than 6 weeks); maintenance therapy for gastric ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing for acute ulcers (placebo-controlled studies have been carried out for 1 year); treatment of GERD (symptomatic relief found to commonly occurs within 24 hours after starting therapy with 150 mg b.i.d.); treatment of endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis (symptomatic relief of heartburn found to commonly occur within 24 hours of therapy initiation with 150 mg b.i.d.); and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis (placebo-controlled trials have been carried out for 48 weeks). Many of the formulations containing the compound of Formula I disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1565966 are known to be unstable and, therefore, not appropriate for marketable formulations that are required to be stable. U.S. Pat. No. 4,585,790, on the other hand, discloses improved aqueous formulations of ranitidine that are more stable. That patent discloses ranitidine formulations having a pH in the range 6.5 to 7.5 that are suitable formulations for injections for intravenous and intramuscular administration, continuous infusions, and oral preparations such as syrups. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,068,249 discloses stabile, aqueous formulations of ranitidine containing ethanol as a stabilizer. That patent describes a pharmaceutical composition which is an aqueous formulation of ranitidine and/or one or more physiologically acceptable salts thereof containing ethanol and that is suitable for administration to patients and will, in general, contain at least one conventional pharmaceutical excipient in addition to the ethanol and ranitidine and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 6,265,449 discloses an aqueous pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising ranitidine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, that contains alcohol and low color, metal, turbidity (LCMT) sucrose, which was found to improved stability, bioavailability and taste-masking of ranitidine while allowing the volume of the alcohol required in the solution to be reduced. A commercially available version of a stable pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the compound of Formula I is known as ZANTAC\u00ae syrup, which is described in prescribing information as being a clear peppermint-flavored liquid that contains 16.8 mg of ranitidine-HCl equivalent to 15 milligrams (mg) of ranitidine per 1 milliliter (ml) (75 mg/5 mL) in bottles of 16 fluid ounces (one pint). Because of its relative instability, ZANTAC\u00ae is usually stored between about 4\u00b0 and about 25\u00b0 C. (39\u00b0 and 77\u00b0 F.) in tight, light-resistant containers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been surprisingly found that aqueous syrup formulations containing the compound of Formula I, or other physiologically acceptable salts of ranitidine, can be stabilized without the use of ethanol or other alcohols as taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,068,249 and 6,265,449, and at pH ranges that are higher and lower than the ranges set forth in those patents. In particular, it has been found that ranitidine is stable in non-polar media or media having a relatively low polarity such that the dielectric constant is less than about 60, the stability achieved by using certain saccharides, starches (preferably relatively high molecular weight starches), and/or certain celluloses instead of alcohol; buffers may or may not be needed. An advantage of the formulations of the present invention is the relatively high concentration of the saccharides that help mask the taste of ranitidine. Another advantage of the formulations of the present invention is that non-alcoholic aqueous formulations are generally preferred by, among others, parents who administer those formulations to their children. Thus, the present invention involves a pharmaceutical composition which is an aqueous formulation containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of ranitidine and/or one or more physiologically acceptable salts thereof for treatment of conditions mediated through histamine H 2 -receptors, the formulation having a pH preferably within the range of about 4.85 to about 7.99, and most preferably within the range of about 6.5 to about 7.5, making it suitable for administration to humans and other mammals. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention involves a pharmaceutical composition of the compound of Formula I, or other physiologically acceptable salts of ranitidine, that is stable when dissolved in or combined with one or more saccharides, one or more starches (preferably relatively high molecular weight starches), and/or celluloses as stabilizers. In addition, physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents, colorants, flavorants, and other substances may also be added. The preferred saccharides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, inverse sugar, dextrose, glucose, trehalose, lycasin (70% corn syrup), cyclodextrins, niacinamide, dextran, and other mono-, oligo- and poly-saccharides. The preferred starches of the present invention include, but are not limited to, maize starch, potato starch, pregelatinized starch, topiaco and hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES). Cyclodextrins, which are cyclic carbohydrates derived from starch, are also contemplated as part of the invention for use in the stable compositions of ranitidine hydrochloride. The preferred cellulose of the present invention include, but is not limited to, hydroxyl propyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC). The concentration of the stabilizers preferably varies from about 5% to about 80% volume per total final composition, preferably from about 40% to about 70% volume per total final composition, most preferably about 5%, especially in the case of cellulose. The concentration of the compound of Formula I is preferably about 16.8 mg/ml. Stable pharmaceutical formulations of ranitidine hydrochloride using PVP and niacinamide are also contemplated. Excipients include those that are suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions and include, but are not limited to suspending agents, dispersing or wetting agents, preservatives, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and sweetening agents. Stabilization of the ranitidine in the present invention is accomplished by, for example, reducing the dielectric constant of water. Water is a very polar medium and ranitidine, being a polar molecule, effectively degrades in water. By reducing the dielectric constant of the medium in which ranitidine will come in contact with, or by reducing the water activity at the reaction site, the stability of the ranitidine may be increased, which is to say that the degradation potential may be reduced. The hydrolytic degradation reaction involving ranitidine is essentially as follows: Previous attempts to affect the degradation of ranitidine formulations focused on slowing down the rate of conversion of the ranitidine transition complex (k2) to the final degradation product. In the present invention, the stabilizers preferably reacts with water and thus reduces the water activity at the reaction site. That, in turn, slows down the rate of formation of the transition complex (k1), which controls the overall degradation of the ranitidine. It has been found that buffering may or may not be needed with the formulations of the present invention. If a buffer is used, the buffer can be, but is not limited to, acetate, citrate, phosphate, succinate, or any pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base with pKa ranging 4.5 to 6.5. The preferred buffer includes citric acid and disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, or potassium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate. Formulations of the present invention may be prepared by combining, in an appropriate sequence, an amount of the compound of Formula I, or other physiologically acceptable salts of ranitidine, with one or more saccharides or high molecular weight starches, and with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents, colorants, flavorants, or other substances, whereby the compound of Formula I is combined with the one or more saccharides or one or more high molecular weight starches, or one or more celluloses in order to achieve a generally stabilizing effect on the ranitidine. The resulting ranitidine concentration is about 15 mg/ml of free base (ranitidine plus water), preferably 16.8 mg/ml of free base. The formulations of the invention may be made according to the following process. First, potable water, e.g. 40 mL, is transferred into a beaker calibrated to a predetermined batch volume, e.g. 50 ml. An amount of raniditine is added to the water to make a solution having a desired concentration, e.g. about 16.8 mg/ml. Into that solution, a sufficient amount of a buffer is dissolved to obtain a target pH, e.g. about 4.85 to about 7.99, preferably about 6.5 to about 7.5. Next, a stabilizer, such as one or more saccharides, and/or high molecular weight starches, and/or HPC or other cellulose, is/are admixed with the water/ranitidine/buffer solution in an amount necessary to stabilize the raniditine. An amount of potable water is then added to fill to the predetermined batch volume. In addition to the above components, one or more excipients may be added to the solution along with the stabilizing agent. Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and utilize the compounds of the present invention and practice the methods. The following examples are given to illustrate the present invention. It should be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific conditions or details described in these examples. EXAMPLE 1 The formulations of the invention are made according to the following process. First, 40 ml of potable water are transferred into a beaker calibrated to a batch volume of 50 ml. An amount of ranitidine is added to the water to make a solution having a concentration of about 16.8 mg/ml. Into that solution, a sufficient amount of a buffer is dissolved to obtain desired pH. In some occasions. 0.1N NaOH was also used to adjust the pH in addition to buffer to get the target pH. Next, a stabilizing agent such as one or more saccharides and/or high molecular weight starches is/are admixed with the water/ranitidine/buffer solution in an amount necessary to stabilize the ranitidine. An amount of potable water is then added to create a batch volume of 50 ml. Samples of the resulting composition are introduced into 5-ml flint stopper vials for accelerated stability tests. In addition to the above components, one or more excipients may be added to the solution along with the stabilizing agent.

Hydroxypropyl cellulose is used as a binder in the granulation step of tablet dosage form development. It has high affinity for water. Hence, it was theorized that the HPC is extensively hydrated by water thereby reduces the activity of water at the reaction site. A formulation, RNT-42, comprising ranitidine 16.8 mg/ml, hydroxypropyl cellulose 5%, KH 2 PO 4 3 mg/ml, Na 2 HPO 4 1 mg/ml., pH adjusted to 5.8 was prepared and its stability along with the simulated ranitidine syrup (innovator formulation) was evaluated.

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/706,926, filed on Sep. 28, 2012. The entirety of that disclosure is hereby fully incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND [0002] The present disclosure relates to a pointing device worn on the head of a user. It finds particular application in conjunction with training for surgical education, and will be described with particular reference thereto, although it can be used for many other purposes such as teaching of combined skills where hands-free pointing, spotting, indicating, or directing is useful. [0003] Part of the training process to become a board eligible surgeon involves completion of a residency program. In the residency program, the resident doctor will perform surgical procedures on a consenting patient under the supervision of a trainer surgeon. [0004] When taking a surgical resident through a procedure, the trainer&#39;s hands are often busy performing the steps of the operation, and instructions and directions must be given verbally. This is true for both laparoscopic and open procedures. In addition, the surgical resident is usually participating in the procedure as well, wielding surgical instruments such as a scalpel or other cutting or suturing implements. It would be helpful for the trainer to have a pointing device that can be worn and used to accurately direct the trainee where to focus and dissect, suture, cauterize, etc., in the patient. BRIEF DESCRIPTION [0005] The present disclosure relates to a pointing device that can be worn on a user&#39;s head, such as the head of a trainer teaching surgical procedures. The pointing device includes a laser pointer that provides a dot or beam of light at a location dictated by the user, such as to certain tissue to be excised from a patient. An user-operated pneumatically controlled switch is provided so that the dot/beam can be toggled on or off by the user without manual intervention. The switch can be controlled by the users breath. The pointing device also includes a band/strap assembly for forming a head harness for mounting the laser pointer and switching mechanism to the head of the user. By moving the user&#39;s head and by activating the switch to engage the laser pointer, the user can point to a given target, such as tissue to be excised from a patient, during a surgical procedure. [0006] Disclosed in embodiments herein is an adjustable head-mounted pointing device that comprises a circumferential headband; a cross strap extending between opposite sides of the circumferential headband; a laser pointer mounted on one side of the circumferential headband; a battery pack; and a pneumatically controlled switch for activating the laser pointer. The laser pointer is an electronic device that converts input power into a narrow beam of coherent light that is used to disclose a targeted area by the user upon activation. [0007] The battery pack can be mounted at the center of the cross strap. Alternatively, the battery pack can be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband opposite the laser pointer. In other embodiments, the battery pack can be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband behind the laser pointer. [0008] The laser pointer may emit a red or green colored light beam. Other color or color combinations are also contemplated, as well as dual colors or multiple color combination lasers. For example, the color green may be used by the trainer to indicate to proceed forward, red to halt, etc. [0009] An adjustment device or dial may be present on a rear side of the circumferential headband for controlling the circumference of the headband. [0010] The pointing device may sometimes further comprise a mount on a front side of the circumferential headband, the mount having an arm and a grip. Other times, the pointing device further comprises at least one longitudinally-oriented catch on the cross strap. The pointing device could further comprise at least one vertically-oriented catch on the circumferential headband. [0011] The laser pointer may include a base and a muzzle. The pneumatically controlled switch may include a means for conveying pneumatic pressure, such as a straw connected to a pressure transducer. [0012] Also described in embodiments is a head-mounted pointing device that comprises a frame formed from a circumferential headband and a cross strap that extends between opposite sides of the circumferential headband; a battery pack mounted at the center of the cross strap; a laser pointer mounted on one side of the circumferential headband, the laser pointer having a base and a muzzle; a pneumatically controlled switch for controlling the laser pointer, the switch including a flexible straw extending from the base of the laser pointer; means for changing the size of the circumferential headband; means for changing the size of the cross strap; and a mount on a front side of the circumferential headband, the mount having an arm and a grip. [0013] Methods of using a head-mounted pointing device to point to a given target during a surgical procedure are also disclosed. The head-mounted pointing device is donned by the user, such as the surgical trainer. The laser pointer of the pointing device is engaged or toggled on by breathing (e.g. puffing) at a pneumatically controlled switch to activate a laser beam. The laser beam is then pointed at the given target. [0014] The laser pointer of the pointing device can be disengaged or the toggled off by breathing (e.g. sipping or sucking) at the pneumatically controlled switch to deactivate the laser beam. [0015] The pneumatically controlled switch sometimes uses a binary control. Other times, the pneumatically controlled switch uses sip-and-puff control. [0016] The method may use any of the various embodiments of a head-mounted pointing device described herein. [0017] These and other non-limiting characteristics of the disclosure are more particularly disclosed below. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0018] The following is a brief description of the drawings, which are presented for the purposes of illustrating the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein and not for the purposes of limiting the same. [0019] FIG. 1 is a side perspective view of a prototype of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. [0020] FIG. 2 is a top view of the prototype of FIG. 1. [0021] FIG. 3 is a front view of the prototype of FIG. 1. [0022] FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram or schematic illustrating the control of the laser pointer. [0023] FIG. 5 is an illustration of another embodiment of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. [0024] FIG. 6 depicts the head-mounted pointing device of FIG. 5 on the head of the user. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0025] A more complete understanding of the compositions and methods disclosed herein can be obtained by reference to the accompanying drawings. These figures are merely schematic representations based on convenience and the ease of demonstrating the present disclosure, and are, therefore, not intended to define or limit the scope of the exemplary embodiments. [0026] Although specific terms are used in the following description for the sake of clarity, these terms are intended to refer only to the particular structure of the embodiments selected for illustration in the drawings, and are not intended to define or limit the scope of the disclosure. In the drawings and the following description below, it is to be understood that like numeric designations refer to components of like function. [0027] The present disclosure relates to a pointing or spotting device that can be worn on the head of the user. As previously noted, such a pointing device can be useful for a trainer surgeon/trainer of surgical procedures who is working with a surgical resident or trainee. Teaching in the operating room is particularly difficult in laparoscopic cases, because it is difficult to demonstrate on the laparoscopic instrument screen where the trainee should direct their attention or where they should operate, when the trainer&#39;s hands are busy. The pointing device can be used to visually indicate a particular location to the surgical resident instead of through spoken words. [0028] However, the pointing device cannot simply be an always-on device. For example, the trainer may wish to indicate a location where the surgical resident should dissect (i.e. cut). However, with an always-on device, the surgical resident may continue dissecting at the indicated location when the trainer wishes dissection to stop. A switch is required to deactivate the pointing device. However, the hands of the trainer surgeon are sterile, and the feet of the trainer surgeon may be operating other instruments. Thus, a different switching mechanism must be used. [0029] FIG. 1 is a right side perspective view of a prototype of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. FIG. 2 is a top view of the prototype device. FIG. 3 is a front view of the prototype device. This device may also be considered to be a laser headlight, or a hands-free device, or a head-mounted laser pointer, or headgear with a mounted pointing device. [0030] The head-mounted pointing device 100 includes a frame formed from a circumferential headband 110 and a cross strap 120. The circumferential headband extends around the wearer&#39;s head, and has an interior surface 112 and an exterior surface 114 (see FIG. 2 for a better view of these two surfaces). The cross strap 120 extends between opposite sides (usually the left side 102 and the right side 104 ) of the circumferential headband, and passes over the wearer&#39;s head. It is contemplated that the cross strap passes between the ears of the user, for comfort. The cross strap 120 also has an interior surface 122 and an exterior surface 124 (see FIG. 3 for a better view of these two surfaces). The cross strap may be described as a half circle, and the circumferential headband may be described as a full circle. The frame can be made in several different ways. The size of the circumferential headband can be adjusted; for example, as illustrated here, a dial 116 is present on the rear side 108 of the circumferential headband to control its circumference. Similarly, the size of the cross strap can also be adjusted. These allow the frame to be fitted to the head of the user and worn comfortably. The frame can be made of any suitable material. For example, the frame can be made of plastic, cloth, etc. here, a padding 118 is present on the front side 106 of the circumferential headband. The circumferential headband on the cross strap may be made as one integral piece, or may be made as separate components that are later joined together. [0031] It is contemplated that additional attachment means may be present on the frame for holding other tools or equipment. For example, also visible on the front side 106 of the frame is a mount 130 that extends outwardly from the exterior surface 114 of the circumferential headband. The mount includes an arm 134 and a grip 132 at the end of the arm. The arm is adjustable at both ends 136 , 138 for positioning the grip as desired. It is contemplated that, for example an illumination light can be held by the grip to provide illumination to the user. This light (not shown) is usually oriented in a different direction from that of the laser pointer. As another example, a longitudinally-oriented molded catch 129 is also present on either side of the cross strap 120 , and can be used to hold additional items as desired by the user. As yet another example, also visible in FIG. 2 are two vertically oriented molded catches 119 located on the rear side 108 of the circumferential headband. However, it should be clear that embodiments are contemplated in which these additional attachment means are not present. [0032] A laser pointer 140 is mounted to one side of the circumferential headband. As illustrated here, the laser pointer is mounted on the right side 104 of the frame, where the cross strap 120 connects to the headband 110. The laser pointer 140 is mounted to one side of the circumferential headband, i.e. on the left side 102 or right side 104 of the user&#39;s head, rather than directly in front (i.e. on the user&#39;s forehead). The laser pointer typically emits a red or green color, which provides for visual distinction against the background. The power of the laser pointer is very low, usually 5 miiliwatts (mW) or less. The laser pointer can be mounted to the circumferential headband using generally known means such as hook-and-loop fasteners, adhesive, etc. As illustrated here, the laser pointer 140 includes a base 142 and a muzzle 144. The muzzle points in the direction in which the laser light will be emitted, towards the front of the frame. [0033] A battery pack 150 is included to provide power to the laser pointer. A wire 152 connects the battery pack 150 to the laser pointer 140. As illustrated here, the battery pack is placed at the center 125 of the cross strap, i.e. on top of the user&#39;s head, for balance. However, it is possible for the battery pack to be mounted anywhere on the headband 110 or the cross strap 120. For example, the battery pack could be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband opposite the laser pointer. Alternatively, the battery pack could be attached to the circumferential headband behind the laser pointer 140. Desirably, the battery pack is placed to minimize neck strain. The battery pack contains standard batteries, e.g. AA, AAA. C, D, 9-volt, button/coin cells, etc. [0034] A pneumatically controlled switch 160 is used to turn the laser pointer 141 on or off. The switch includes a pressure transducer (not visible) and a straw 162 which extends from the laser pointer down towards and off to one side of the users mouth. The straw is detachable (for replacement as needed) and flexible (for customization to the user). A mouthpiece 164 is located at the free end of the straw. As illustrated here, the pressure transducer is located within the base of the laser pointer, and the straw 162 and mouthpiece 164 are visible. [0035] It is contemplated that the laser pointer can be activated or controlled by blowing into the straw to toggle the laser pointer on and off. This can be done using a binary control, where the on/off state of the laser pointer is stored and switched with each breath registered by the switch. Alternatively, a \u201csip-and-puff\u201d style of control may be used. For example, a higher-than-normal atmospheric air pressure can be produced by puffing and blowing into the straw, and this higher air pressure could be used to turn on the laser pointer. A lower-than-normal atmospheric air pressure can be produced by sipping or sucking against the straw, and this lower air pressure could be used to turn off the laser pointer. This pneumatically controlled switch may also be referred to as a blow switch. The pneumatically controlled switch operates by detecting a change in pressure exerted by the users breathing. [0036] In other embodiments, it is also contemplated that the laser pointer is able to produce multiple colors, or that two or more laser pointers emitting different colors are placed on the head-mounted pointing device. To control the different laser pointers, additional pneumatically controlled switches may be present as well. For example, in one variation, a red laser pointer is mounted on the right side of the frame, and a green laser pointer is mounted on the left side of the frame. Two pneumatically controlled switches are provided, one on each side of the users head. Each switch would control a separate laser pointer. For example, the red laser pointer could be controlled by blowing to the right, and the green laser pointer could be controlled by blowing to the left. This type of control would permit both a red dot and a green dot to be on the target simultaneously. If desired, the red laser pointer and the green laser pointer could be placed on the same side of the frame, as long as the pneumatically controlled switches are located on opposite sides of the frame. Alternatively, a multicolor laser pointer could be mounted on the frame along with two pneumatically controlled switches. One switch would toggle the laser pointer on and off, and the other switch would control which color was being generated by the laser pointer. [0037] FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing the control of the laser pointer via the pneumatically controlled switch. Beginning at the left side, Switch 1 is an on/off switch that determines whether the laser pointer can be activated at all. This on/off switch may be located on the laser pointer or on the battery pack, and is usually electromechanical in nature. Switch 2 is the pneumatically controlled switch. The pneumatically controlled switch operates by sensing the difference in pressure between a high port and a low port, and operates based on the time period for which a differential pressure above a specified threshold level is applied. The threshold level can be adjusted by changing the leftmost capacitor in the diagram. A data or delay (D) flip-flop circuit is used to control the laser emission. When Switch 1 is closed, the laser pointer is in the ON state, or in other words is able to receive user input and be toggled on/off. Switch 2 provides the toggle function. Initially, blowing into the blow switch closes Switch 2 and turns the laser on to emit the laser beam. After the pressure is removed, Switch 2 is opened, and the laser beam is emitted until Switch 2 is closed again. Put another way, Switch 1 controls whether the laser pointer device is ON or OFF. Switch 2 changes the state of the laser beam (from ON to OFF, or from OFF to ON). An inverting Schmitt trigger is used to add hysteresis and prevent unwanted rapid switching of the laser emission/debounce the circuit. The input voltage to the circuit must fall below a threshold value before the laser pointer is toggled on/off."

  "query": "What innovations does the patent application Ser. No. 13/071594 pertaining to spray nozzle design for catheters describe for cryoablation procedures?,",
  "negative": "The disclosed information outlines a catheter system for thermally mediated interventions. The catheter consists of a shaft that channels a thermally conductive fluid to a distal segment which employs thermal energy. This fluid can be a heat transfer medium and may be gas or liquid at varying temperatures. The catheters generally are employed to alter tissue temperature, such as heating or cooling specific parts of the body for therapeutic effects. More recently, thermal ablation catheters have been outlined for thermal treatment, to change the tissue temperature significantly, affecting tissue viability, especially in the context of targeted tissue alteration like excision of abnormal growths. These devices can be inserted endovascularly, or through narrow routes, through smaller incisions to reach the treatment area. Given the requirements for precision in thermal application, strict conditions govern the functionality of an efficient system. For instance, the catheter's contact area must transfer thermal energy effectively at the required temperature. Cooling or heating rates are influenced by the medium delivery and circulation across the operative region, and are further impacted by the shape and material properties that govern thermal conduction. In addition, directional control over the thermal medium flow towards specific tissue sites is essential. In some applications, directing the medium on a particular spot may suffice, while in others, a linear or targeted application may be preferable. However, due to the minute scale of the catheter's tip, conditions within are often inconsistent and unpredictable, caused partly by the pressure dynamics of the medium within a confined space at the tip, and its subsequent movement through a return pathway from the tip section, which often results in unsteady flow. Thus, while existing catheter designs offer effective thermal transfer, high-pressure introduction into tiny expansion areas can lead to inefficiencies and unpredictable flow patterns. Therefore, catheters could see improvements in methods and devices for a uniform and controlled flow of the heat transfer medium targeting specific cellular areas.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application is a divisional of and claims priority to patent application Ser. No. 13/071594, filed Mar. 25, 2011, entitled SPRAY NOZZLE DESIGN FOR A CATHETER, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] n/a TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] The disclosure relates to catheter-based medical devices, and more particularly to mechanisms and methods for controlling the dispersion of cryogenic fluid from a cryoablation catheter. BACKGROUND [0004] Many medical procedures are performed using minimally invasive surgical techniques wherein one or more devices are inserted through one or more small incisions into a patient&#39;s body. For example, a cardiac arrhythmia may be treated through selective ablation of cardiac tissue to eliminate the source of the arrhythmia. Radio frequency energy, microwave energy, laser energy, extreme heat, or extreme cold may be provided by the ablation device to ablate the tissue. [0005] One category of such ablation devices is the minimally-invasive, catheter-based device that is introduced into the vasculature and used to treat tissue by cooling contact. Such catheter-based devices, henceforth generically referred to herein simply as \u201ccatheters\u201d have an elongated body through which a cooling fluid circulates to a tip portion which is adapted to contact and cool tissue. The cooling fluid used with such catheters may be a low temperature fluid, or cryogens. In general, the catheters may be used to lower the temperature of tissue, such as cardiac wall tissue, to an extent such that signal generation or conduction ceases and allows one to map or confirm that the catheter is positioned at a particular lesion or arrhythmia conduction site. More recently, cryoablation catheters have been configured for ablation treatment, to cool the tissue to a much lower level at which freezing destroys the viability of the tissue, and, in the case of cardiac tissue, permanently removes it as a signal generating or signal conducting locus. Such devices are also useful for tissue destruction in other contexts, such as the ablation of tumorous, diseased, precancerous or congenitally abnormal tissue. [0006] The catheters may be adapted for endovascular insertion, or for insertion along relatively confined pathways, for example through a body lumen, or through a small incision to and around intervening organs, to reach an intended ablation site. As such, they are characterized by a relatively elongated body through which the cooling fluid circulates, and a tip or distal end portion where the cooling is to be applied. The requirement that the coolant be localized in its activity poses stringent constraints on a working device. For example, when the catheter contact must chill tissue to below freezing, the coolant itself must attain a substantially lower temperature. The rate of cooling is limited by the ability to supply coolant and circulate it through the active contact region, and the efficacy of the contact region itself is further limited by geometry and physical properties that affect its ability to conduct heat into the tissue. [0007] Furthermore, it is generally desirable to control the direction of the cryogenic fluid flow to only the target tissue sites. In some procedures, a spot tissue ablation procedure\u2014where the fluid flow is directed at a specific site\u2014may be acceptable. For other procedures, it may be more therapeutically effective if the fluid flow is directed along a predetermined line, or a single elongate ring or linear lesion created in a single ablative step. However, the small dimensions of the catheter assembly have the result that flow conditions existing within the catheter tip are turbulent and chaotic. This arises in part because the high pressure release of fluid in a relatively small chamber at the tip of the catheter and/or its recirculation back via a return conduit from the tip region involve relatively turbulent fluid flow conditions, so that the precise control of directional contact on the tissue may be subject to rather wide variations. Thus, while conventional catheter arrangements have been found to provide a high level of cooling, the introduction at high pressure into the small expansion chamber results in cavitation, turbulence and irregular fluid flow evolving in the short distance and brief time between the jet spray of expanding coolant and the lower pressure conditions existing at the proximal end of the chamber adjacent the coolant return passage. [0008] Accordingly, cryoablation catheters could benefit from improved techniques and devices for providing uniform and evenly controlled flow of the thermal transfer fluid onto the targeted tissue cells. SUMMARY [0009] The disclosure generally describes a cryoablation catheter for use in tissue ablation. The catheter comprises an elongate supply lumen, or injection tube, which carries a cryofluid or refrigerant from a refrigerant supply unit. Typically, a source of refrigerant is connected to the proximal end of the supply lumen and a cryochamber, or expandable chamber, is located at the lumen&#39;s distal end. In some embodiments, the source of refrigerant is a fluid that is ejected from the supply lumen through an orifice coupled at a distal portion of the lumen and housed within the expandable chamber. The catheter also comprises a fluid dispersion unit that is also housed, at least partially, within the expandable chamber. At the predetermined pressures to which the cryoablation fluid is subjected, the construction of the fluid dispersion unit must be so designed and dimensioned to disperse a definite amount of fluid within certain limits. The dispersion unit of the present disclosure serves to evenly distribute the refrigerant exiting the distal end of the supply lumen across at least some portion of the interior of the expansion chamber. [0010] Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure teach fluid dispersion units which control the distribution of fluid flowing therethrough. In one example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises a flow distribution sleeve that induces in a fluid expelled from there sleeve a motion having a predetermined pattern. In another example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises a deflection member that redirects the direction of flow of a fluid in a predetermined pattern. In yet another example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises an arrangement of the flow distribution sleeve and the deflection member. [0011] In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, a fluid nozzle is disposed on the distal end of a supply lumen. The fluid nozzle is disposed within a fluid dispersion unit in a predetermined arrangement. In some examples, the arrangement of the fluid nozzle and the fluid dispersion unit causes fluid flowing from the nozzle to undergo a predetermined motion. [0012] Other embodiments disclose a catheter which includes an outer tubular member capable of insertion into the vessels of the body. An expandable chamber, such as a distendable balloon, is disposed at the distal end of the outer tubular member. An inner tubular member substantially spanning the length of the outer tubular member may be employed to carry a fluid to the interior of the expandable chamber. A fluid nozzle is disposed on the distal end of the inner tubular member. A fluid dispersion unit is provided in fluidic-communication with the fluid dispersion unit for controlling the direction of dispersion of the fluid. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0013] The following drawings are illustrative of particular embodiments of the present disclosure and therefore do not limit the scope of the disclosure. The drawings (not to scale) are intended for use in conjunction with the explanations in the following detailed description, wherein similar elements are designated by identical reference numerals. Moreover, the specific location of the various features is merely exemplary unless noted otherwise. [0014] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary ablation catheter of the present disclosure as it would be deployed and used for an ablation procedure; [0015] FIG. 2 shows a cryogenic treatment system in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure; [0016] FIG. 3 depicts a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exemplary catheter tip in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated; [0017] FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a catheter constructed in accordance with principles of this disclosure; [0018] FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a catheter tip constructed in accordance with principles of this disclosure; and [0019] FIGS. 6-8 illustrate alternative embodiments of a catheter in accordance with the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0020] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure. [0021] In one aspect, the catheter described herein can be used for performing ablation near or within the pulmonary veins of the heart where an ablation band that may have a circumferential or linear geometry across the targeted tissue is formed. However, the devices described herein are not limited to cardiac applications. [0022] To better understand the environment in which the devices and methods of the present disclosure are used, a general overview of an ablation procedure is believed to be useful. The example pertains to a catheter-based ablation treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, wherein a specific area of cardiac tissue having aberrant conductive pathways, such as atrial rotors, emitting or conducting erratic electrical impulses, is cold-treated through energy transfer derived from thermodynamic changes occurring in the flow of a cryogenic fluid through the catheter device. This energy transfer creates a net transfer of heat from the target tissue to the device, typically achieved by cooling a portion of the device to very low temperature through conductive and convective heat transfer between the cryogen and target tissue. [0023] Referring to FIG. 1 , the treatment to be accomplished with the devices, systems and methods described in this disclosure is illustrated. FIG. 1 shows a cutaway view of the human heart 10 , showing the major structures of the heart 10 including the left and right atria, and the pulmonary veins 15 a, 15 b. The atrial septum separates the left and right atria. The fossa ovalis 11 is a small depression in the atrial septum that may be used as an access pathway to the left atrium from the right atrium, such as with a transeptal puncture device and transeptal sheath. The fossa ovalis 11 can be punctured, and easily reseals and heals after procedure completion. In a patient suffering from atrial fibrillation, aberrant electrically conducive tissue may be found in the atrial walls, as well as in the pulmonary veins 15 a, 15 b. Ablation of these areas, referred to as arrhythmogenic foci (also referred to as drivers or rotors), is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation. Systems, devices and methods of the present disclosure provide means of creating lesions, including lesions to surround the pulmonary vein ostia, and are deployed to identify and ablate the driver and rotor tissue. [0024] To accomplish this, a catheter ( FIG. 2 ) is inserted into the right atrium, preferably through the inferior vena cava or through the superior vena cava. The catheter is sized for advancement through the patient&#39;s vasculature. As an example, which is not intended to be limiting, an exemplary catheter may have a shaft having a diameter ranging from 7-9 Fr, with the shaft length ranging from 100-125 cm and the overall length being in the range of 140-160 cm. The catheter may be passed through transeptal sheath, which may or may not be a deflectable sheath since the catheter preferably includes a deflectable distal portion. When passing into the left atrium, the transeptal sheath passes through or penetrates the fossa ovalis 11 , such as over guide wire 17 which may have been placed by the transeptal puncture device. The catheter is inserted over guide wire 17 and through transeptal sheath such that its distal end enters the lumen of right superior pulmonary vein 15 a, 15 b. The catheter carries an ablating element, such as an expandable chamber ( FIG. 2 ) into the left atrium. The expandable chamber is transitioned to expand to a maximal diameter by, for example inflation, such that the expandable chamber is in contact with the walls of the target tissue e.g., pulmonary vein ostia to occlude the vein. [0025] An electrical mapping procedure may be performed to identify or confirm the location of the target cardiac tissue. Next, a treatment medium (e.g., cryogenic fluid) provided by a source external to the patient, is provided through the catheter into the ablating element to ablate the neighboring tissue and form a lesion. The system may utilize various systems, such as the Joule-Thompson effect, to achieve the cooling including the exemplary systems described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,780,657 to Abboud et al., entitled \u201cCOOLING SYSTEM,\u201d which issued on Aug. 24, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, in one embodiment, a pressurized liquid or a liquid/gas mixture passes into a region where it is enabled to evaporate. In other embodiments, a cryogenic fluid delivered to an expandable balloon is a pressurized gas wherein expansion of the pressurized fluid effects the cooling. Accordingly, the cooling methods may allow for expansion of a compressed fluid independent of whether there is a phase change and/or may include phase changes from liquid to gas or an expanded gas being cooled to such an extent that a portion of the expanded gas actually condenses into a liquid phase. Suitable cryogenic fluids will be non-toxic and include nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the like. By delivering the cryogenic fluid through the catheter body, the balloon can be expanded and cooled in order to effect treatments according to the present disclosure. [0026] The created lesions may be segmented and localized. The lesions may be linear or curvilinear, circumferential and partial circumferential, and/or continuous or discontinuous. The lesions created by the ablation catheters are suitable for inhibiting the propagation of inappropriate electrical impulses in the heart 10 for prevention of reentrant arrhythmias. In general, the catheter ablation therapy will disrupt the electrical pathways in cardiac tissue to stop the emission of and/or prevent the propagation of erratic electric impulses. [0027] FIG. 2 shows a cryogenic treatment system 20 in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. System 20 includes a treatment catheter 22 having a handle 24 , and elongated cryogen transporting body 26 and a catheter tip 28 (described in more detail in FIG. 3 ). The catheter 22 is connected by various conduits or cables to a console 30 which may, for example, have a display monitor 32 and other data entry or display accessories such as a keyboard, a printer and the like. Operation of the console 30 involves controlling the timing and amount of coolant injected through the catheter 22 at a defined injection pressure, which may be a pressure of about 400 psig, for example. The entire catheter 22 may be dimensioned to fit in a No. 14 French introducer or smaller. The console 32 is connected to the catheter 22 by various lines 34 which may include a coolant injection line 36 , a coolant return line 38 and electrical cabling 40 which carries outputs of various cardiac sensing, thermal sensing, mapping or other elements as may be used for catheter treatment or monitoring. As shown, the handle 24 is equipped with input ports for an electrical connector 42 , a coolant injection tube connector 44 , and a return tube connector 46. These connect by various internal junctions or tubes passing through the handle and elongated body 26 to the distal tip of the catheter. The handle 24 may also include various control assemblies, e.g., switches or valves, as well as safety detection or shutdown elements (not illustrated). [0028] Turning to FIG. 3 , a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exemplary catheter tip in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. Tip 28 of the exemplary catheter 22 comprises an outer tube 50 which may be coupled to an outer balloon 52. An inner balloon 54 may be disposed within the outer balloon 52. The void within inner balloon 54 defines an expandable chamber 56. In use, both the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be expanded concurrently to contact a blood vessel or other tissue during an ablation procedure. Although the exemplary embodiment depicts a gap between portions of the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 , it should be noted that the entire perimeter of both outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be in contact. The outer balloon 52 contains leaks in the inner balloon 54 should they occur. Low pressure or vacuum return lumens 58 and 58 \u2032 may be in fluid communication with the interior of the outer and inner balloons, respectively. [0029] Outer tube 50 defines a lumen that may circumferentially enclose an injection tube 60 so that the tubes may be substantially coaxially disposed with respect to each other, such that a longitudinal centerline (not shown) of outer tuber 50 approximately coincides with the longitudinal centerline (not shown) of injection tube 60. Injection tube 60 may substantially span the length of outer tube 50 and may terminate at a point slightly more distal to the absolute distal end of outer tube 50 such as within the second balloon 60. Injection tube 60 will generally be in fluid communication with the coolant injection line 36 ( FIG. 2 ) while the return lumens 58 and 58 \u2032 will typically be in fluid communication with coolant return line 38 ( FIG. 2 ). However, other implementations in accordance with the principles set forth herein are contemplated. For example, while the injection tube 60 in fluid communication with injection line 36 have been illustrated as being separate components, other exemplary embodiments may combine both components into a unitary component. [0030] Injection tube 60 may be disposed over a guidewire structure such as a tube, a shim or the guide wire 17 that passes through or is contained within the lumen defined by outer tube 50."

  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] The present invention claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/584,737, filed Jun. 30, 2004, entitled \u201cSwimming Pool Lift and Transfer Bar,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by this reference as though set forth fully herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to swimming pool accessories. More particularly, it relates to a lift for use by a person to access a swimming pool from a pool deck. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In the field of swimming pool accessories, various types of stationary and portable chairs and lifts are used to provide access to the pool. In particular, such chairs may be used by disabled or elderly people for whom pool access is difficult. Such individuals may access the pool alone or with the assistance of one or more other individuals who are located either in the pool or on the pool deck, or both. Conventional pool lifts have various shortcomings, namely that they are difficult for an individual to access and are difficult to control by both the user and any assistants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a lift is provided. The lift includes a base and a mast extending from the base. An arm is pivotally connected to the mast. A seat assembly is connected to the arm. An overhead support positioned above the seat assembly. First and second actuators control movement of the lift. The first actuator moves the arm about the pivotal connection between the arm and the mast, thereby moving the seat assembly between a raised position and a lowered position. A second actuator rotates the seat assembly relative to the base. [0005] In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a lift is provided. The lift includes a seat support having first and second ends. A seat is attached to the seat support proximate the first end. An overhead support attached to the seat support proximate the second end. An actuator moves the seat relative to a pool deck on which the lift is positioned. [0006] In still another exemplary embodiment, an overhead support assembly for attachment to a swimming pool lift is provided. The assembly includes a rigid, elongated member having first and second ends. The first end detachably connects to an upper portion of a seat support of a swimming pool lift. The assembly further includes an overhead bar and means for connecting the overhead bar to the elongated member to allow the overhead bar to be positioned above a seat of the lift, within reach of a user positioned in the seat. As the lift moves between raised and lowered positions, the overhead bar remains in substantially equal distance from the seat in both the raised and lowered positions. [0007] In still another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a transfer system for a swimming pool lift is provided. The transfer system includes a base cart assembly and a seat cart assembly. The base cart assembly includes an axel that defines a stem-receiving portion. A first pair of wheels is connected to opposing ends of the axel. A handle extends from the axel. First and second spaced-apart rigid members connect to the axel and extend outward from the axel. Each of said members defines a recessed portion adapted, respectively, to engage pins on opposing sides of a stem. The seat cart assembly includes a second pair of wheels connected by a raised intermediate member and means for supporting a seat of a lift, said means being connected to the second pair of wheels. [0008] The foregoing and other features, utilities and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of a preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0009] The detailed description will refer to the following drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like elements, and wherein: [0010] FIG. 1 shows a perspective view one exemplary embodiment of a lift in a raised position; [0011] FIG. 2 shows an elevation view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIG. 1 , in a raised position; [0012] FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of the lift in a lowered position; [0013] FIG. 4 shows an elevation view of the lift shown in FIG. 3 , in the lowered position; [0014] FIG. 5 shows an assembly view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIGS. 1-4 ; [0015] FIG. 6 shows another assembly view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIG. 5 ; [0016] FIG. 7 shows an elevation view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIGS. 1-6 mounted in a pool deck; [0017] FIG. 8 shows an elevation view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIG. 7 , in a lowered position in which the seat assembly is positioned over and lowered into the pool; [0018] FIG. 9 shows a top view of the embodiment of the lift shown in FIG. 7 ; [0019] FIG. 10 shows a two-part transfer system for transporting the lift; and [0020] FIG. 11 shows a more detailed view of the embodiment of the transfer system shown in FIG. 10 , without the lift present. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0021] FIG. 1 shows a perspective view one exemplary embodiment of a lift 10 in a raised position. In the raised position, the lift 10 may be accessed by a user on the pool deck (not shown). The lift 10 is in a raised position, for example, when a user gets into or out of the lift 10 on the pool deck. The lift 10 includes a base 20 with a mast 30 pivotally connected thereto. The base 20 includes a stem 22 extending from the base 20. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , the lift 10 is a semi-stationary lift that can be removeably positioned in a pool deck by positioning the stem 22 in a suitable anchor (not shown) built into the pool deck, such as those anchors manufactured by Spectrum Products, LLC of Missoula, Mont. In other embodiments, the lift 10 may be stationary in that it may be permanently connected to a pool deck, or may be portable in that it does not attach to the pool deck even in a detachable manner. [0022] First and second arms 60 , 62 are pivotally connected at first ends to the mast 30. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , each of the arms 60 , 62 is formed from a pair of rigid metal bars connected to opposing sides of the mast 30. A first actuator 70 moves the arms 60 , 62 relative to the mast 30. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , the first actuator 70 is connected between the first arm 60 and the mast 30 , and includes a motor (not shown) that extends and retracts a cylinder 72 to cause the arm 60 to pivot relative to the mast 30 , to thereby raise or lower the lift 10. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , the mast 30 also rotates relative to the base 20 , for example, to position a user over the pool or over the deck. Movement of the mast 30 about the base 20 is caused by a second actuator (not shown), such as a motor. A power supply 90 , such as a battery, provides power to the first 70 and second actuators and is connected to the mast 30 near the upper end. [0023] A seat support 40 is connected to second ends of the first and second arms 60 , 62. As the arms 60 , 62 move up and down, the seat support 40 likewise moves up and down. The seat support 40 in one embodiment is a hollow, elongated, rigid metal tube. A chair assembly 80 attaches to a lower portion (not shown) of the seat support 40. An upper portion 50 of the seat support 40 is a rigid bar positioned above a person seated in the lift 10. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , the upper portion 50 of the seat support 40 may be grasped by a user of the lift 10 to facilitate access into and out of the lift 10. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 , an overhead bar 52 is suspended from the upper portion by chains 54 that adjust in length to accommodate users of different heights. Other means may be used to connect the overhead bar 52 to the upper portion 50 of the seat support 40 , such as rope, cable, rigid bars with preset, adjustable stops, etc. In one embodiment (not shown), the upper portion 50 is a rigid elongated member that detachably connects to the seat support 40 to allow the overhead bar to be selectively used by the user. In another embodiment (not shown), the upper portion 50 detachably connects to the seat support 40 at a plurality of different positions along the seat support 40 such that the upper portion 50 may be used alone, without any additional overhead bar (e.g., 52 in FIG. 1 ) supported therefrom, and may be adjusted along the length of the seat support 40 to accommodate users of different heights. [0024] A seat assembly 80 connects to the lower portion 42 of the seat support 40. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 , the seat assembly 80 includes a seat 82 , a seatbelt 86 , a footrest 84 connected to the lower portion 42 of the seat support 40 , and a control holder 85. The control holder 85 holds a first corded remote control 100 used by a user seated in the lift 10 to raise or lower the lift 10 and to rotate the mast 30 about the base 20 to position the seat assembly 80 over the pool deck or over the pool. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 , the seat assembly 80 further includes an adjustable footrest 84. In one embodiment, the footrest 84 is self-adjusting, in that it pivotally connects to the lower portion ( 42 in FIG. 2 ) of the seat support 40 and is permitted to move upward. The footrest 84 moves upward upon contact with a hard surface, such as a pool deck or the bottom of a shallow spa or pool. In one embodiment, the footrest 84 floats in water and pivots upward to meet the user&#39;s feet in the water. [0025] The embodiment of FIG. 1 includes a second remote control 110 connected to the base 20 of the lift 10 by a holder 24. Both the first and second remote controls 100 , 110 control all functions of the lift 10 in this embodiment. The second remote control 110 allows an assistant on the pool deck or in the water near the lift 10 to control the lift 10 without having to be seated in the seat 82. For example, if the user is in the pool, the user or an assistant can move the lift 10 out of the water and over the pool deck without having to be near the first remote control 100. The remote controls 100 , 110 are preferably water-resistant in one embodiment. [0026] In one embodiment, a third control 92 is attached to the mast 30 proximate the power supply 90. In this position, the third control 92 is positioned at approximately waist height of a person, such as the user of the lift 10 or an assistant to the user, standing on the pool deck. The third controller may be permanently affixed to the mast 30 or may be a remote control that is removable from the mast 30 and attached to the lift 10 by a cord, like the first and second remote controls 100 , 110 shown in FIG. 1. In other embodiments, one or more of the remote controls 100 , 110 , 92 may be wireless controls. [0027] In use, a user raises the lift 10 to a raised position over the pool deck, and the user is positioned in the seat 82. Using the first remote control 100 attached to the seat assembly 80 (or another control, e.g., 92 , 110 ), the user or an assistant rotates the seat assembly 80 over the pool. With the seat assembly 80 over the pool, the first control 100 (or another control) is used to lower the seat assembly 80 into the pool. Once in the pool, the user may exit the seat assembly 80. Using the second remote control 110 (or another control) the user or an assistant can raise the lift 10 back to a raised position and rotate the seat assembly 80 away from the pool, if desired. To exit the pool, the user or an assistant again uses a control 100 , 110 , 92 to position the seat assembly 80 over the pool and to lower the lift 10 into a lowered position. With the lift 10 in the lowered position, the user can access the seat 82 and then the lift 10 can be raised to a raised position and rotated away from the pool to allow the user to exit the seat 82 onto the pool deck. [0028] FIG. 2 shows an elevation view of the embodiment of the lift 10 shown in FIG. 1 , in a raised position. As shown in FIG. 2 , the lower portion 42 of the seat support 40 passes below the seat assembly 80. Also shown in FIG. 2 , the stem 22 includes an upper portion 21 that is positioned above the pool deck (not shown) in use. A pin 26 extends outward from the stem 22 and is used to lift and transport the lift 10. In one embodiment, a second pin (not shown in FIG. 2 ) is positioned on the opposing side of the pin 26 , and both pins 26 are engaged by a lifting system (e.g., 300 in FIG. 10 ) to lift and move the lift 10. [0029] FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of the lift 10 in a lowered position. The arms 60 , 62 extend somewhat downward from the mast 30 in this embodiment of the lift 10 , in the lowered position. [0030] FIG. 4 shows an elevation view of the lift 10 shown in FIG. 3 , in the lowered position. In use, the stem 22 mounts in an anchor (not shown) positioned in the pool deck. In one embodiment, the stem 22 is an elongated, cylindrical stem having a diameter in the range of 1.3-3.0 inches, and is adapted to be received in a conventional deck anchor. The deck anchor may be a multipurpose anchor, for example, that may also be used to hold starting platforms, ladders, chairs, or other types of pool accessories, and may have an outside diameter of 1.5 or 1.9 inches in one particular embodiment. In the lowered position, the seat assembly 80 is below the base 20 and below the pool deck (not shown) so that the user can exit the lift 10 into the pool. [0031] FIG. 5 shows an assembly view of the embodiment of the lift 10 shown in FIGS. 1-4. In one embodiment, the lift 10 is held together by multiple conventional fasteners, such as the unnumbered bolts, pins, screws, nuts, washers, etc. shown in FIG. 5. A bracket 32 holds the power supply 90 and the control 92 to the mast 30. [0032] FIG. 6 shows another assembly view of the embodiment of the lift 10 shown in FIG. 5. [0033] FIG. 7 shows an elevation view of the embodiment of the lift 10 shown in FIGS. 1-6 mounted in a pool deck 200. The lift 10 is shown in a raised position in FIG. 7 , with the seat assembly 80 positioned over the deck 200. The pool 220 is shown to the left of the pool wall 210 that meets the deck 200 in the example of FIG. 7.

Field of the Invention The present invention concerns a rotary cutting head using wire-shaped flexible cutting elements. It is advantageously intended for equipping portable cutting devices such as grass cutters, edge cutters, motorized brush cutters or mowers, hedge cutters and similar. More precisely, the invention concerns a rotary cutting head using strands of flexible cutting wire constituted by lengths of wire, rods or slender sticks, made of any suitable material such as \u2018Nylon\u2019\u00ae or other appropriate flexible material. The invention concerns also portable cutting devices equipped with the cutting head disclosed in the description below. 2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98 Motorized tools equipped with such cutting heads are currently used by professionals as well as private individuals. By way of examples documents US-2001/0023542, U.S. Pat. No. 6,401,344, U.S. Pat. No. 6,944,956, WO-2004/064489, WO-2005/032237, WO-2006/017372, WO-2008/139246, FR-2888085 are cited which describe various possible fittings of cutting heads using cutting elements constituted by strands of flexible cutting wires. These cutting heads are mounted at the distal end of a handle equipped with a U-shaped handle or dual guide and control handle for the rotational drive motor of said cutting heads, and with a ring for attaching a carrying harness. A cutting head of this kind supports one or several (most often two) wire-shaped cutting elements extending radially towards the outside, each cutting element presenting a predetermined limited length. The body of the cutting head features, laterally, at least one inlet opening for the engagement of a strand of cutting wire, and, in certain embodiments, at least one opposite opening for the removal of used or damaged cutting wire(s). A clamping mechanism is housed in the body of the cutting head, this mechanism enabling, on the one hand, the driving in of one of the end portions of the cutting strands into the rotary cutting head, and, other hand, opposing the inverse movement of said strands which are thus locked in an active assembly position. This mechanism includes, most often, a toothed toggling cam subjected to the action of a pressure device. According to document WO-2006/017372, each strand of cutting wire presents a predetermined length and can be squeezed, in a detachable manner, in an essentially closed chamber, by means of a squeezing mechanism including a mobile clamping element and a spring which tends to push said clamping element against the proximal end of the strand of cutting wire engaged in said chamber. A releasing element (special tool or screwdriver) is necessary to cooperate with the clamping element in order to move the latter away from the strand of cutting wire, to meet the antagonistic action exerted by the spring, in order to withdraw said strand of cutting wire from the cutting head. In this case, to perform the replacement of a strand or the two cutting strands that are used or damaged, appropriate tools need to be available in order to proceed successively to the neutralization of the springs maintaining said strands in position. Besides being a constraining intervention which requires a certain knowledge and familiarity with the tool, this arrangement does not permit to modify the active length of the cutting strands while the device is being used, without going through the inconvenience pointed out above. Furthermore, the cutting strands cannot traverse the cutting head, because the axis or drive shaft providing the rotation of said cutting head passes through the middle of it. The operators are therefore obliged to use relatively short cutting strands, which increases the frequence of their replacement owing to wear. Document US-2001/0023542 describes a cutting head provided with four side openings to allow the engagement and removal of four cutting strands. The proximal part of each of these strands is engaged in a closed chamber kept in position of active implantation by a dedicated clamping device for each strand. The control element of each clamping device is constituted by a sliding bar which is accessible from the upper face of the housing of the cutting head. Each clamping device is constituted by two horizontal cams subjected to the action of springs between which a strand of cutting wire can be engaged and squeezed. The clamping cams are punctually opened by activation of the sliding control bars placed on the upper part of the cutting head for the purpose of freeing the worn strand and or to allow insertion of a new strand. During the release of the sliding bars, the clamping cams come closer together to exert a squeezing action on the strand under the action of the spring. Utilization of the cutting head described in this document leads to the same inconveniences as those pointed out previously concerning document WO-2006/017372, with, additionally, the inconvenience of a more complex fitting and utilization. The length of the cutting strands is reduced, requiring consequently more frequent replacements of the worn strands. Two cams are necessary to block each cutting wire which increases the number of components and complicates the manufacture of the devices. To remove the used wire, it is necessary: either to extract the wire from below and through the center of the head by simple traction, after having removed the sliding bowl; but one must have beforehand let a length of wire protrude, because otherwise this is impossible; the area where to seize the wire strand for the purpose of extracting it is subject to clogging; or actuate the control bar to unlock the cams; unlocking is done wire by wire and each control bar must be actuated independently which causes a loss of time; the control bars are of small dimensions and therefore difficult to manipulate while wearing gloves; moving the control bars relative to the exterior bell of the cutting head requires some play and thus a risk of clogging and binding. Document U.S. Pat. No. 6,401,344 describes a cutting head of a brush cutter. This cutting device uses a traversing single strand wire and as such generates a significant loss of wire (the entire center of the head). If the wire breaks on one side of the head, it is obligatory to replace all of it. The unlocking bars are located at the outside, and hence subject to clogging. The locking mechanism, in active position, of the single strand of cutting wire in the cutting head is constituted by a complex system of squeezing range which does not allow an automatic locking of the cutting wire, in this position. The devices described in the documents above, and generally speaking, all cutting heads of the state of the art using flexible cutting strands, have these disadvantages: the difficulty, or even in certain cases, the impossibility of making adjustments to the length of the cutting strands depending on the work to be done; the time needed for removing worn cutting strands and for their replacement, because it is obligatory to wear gloves which complicates the manipulations; clogging of exterior control devices for unlocking the blocking means of the cutting strands; the need for having available a tool for opening the cutting head and unlocking the worn or damaged cutting strands. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One objective of the present invention is to remedy the aforementioned disadvantages or, at least to significantly diminish the degree of constraints they impose. According to the invention, this objective is achieved thanks to a cutting head comprising an exterior housing and using two flexible cutting strands that are implantable inside said cutting head, so they can extend radially toward the outside of the latter through orifices made in the side wall of its exterior housing which features, on the one hand, a coupling means to the drive shaft of a motor, and, on the other hand, a strand-holding assembly integral in rotation of said exterior housing and supporting a clamping mechanism of the cutting strands that is engaged inside said exterior housing, this cutting head being particularly remarkable in that the clamping mechanism features squeezing cams mounted so they can pivot in parallel planes between them and to the rotational axis of the cutting head, and in that this strand-holding assembly is mounted with an aptitude of axial translation in the exterior housing of the cutting head, this housing and said clamping mechanism being fitted in complementary fashion, so that the simultaneous application of a relative axial movement in the opposite direction to said exterior housing and to said strand-holding positioning allows: either to raise the squeezing cams so the cutting strands can be positioned or removed, or to lower said cams to achieve the blockage of the cutting strands in the cutting head. Advantageously, the simultaneous application of convergent axial movements to the housing and the strand-holding assembly lodged inside this housing is used to enable the squeezing cams to rise, thereby permitting the introduction, sliding or positioning of the cutting strands inside the cutting head, whereas the simultaneous application of divergent axial movements to said housing and said clamping mechanism support enables said cams to lower themselves so as to obtain the blocking of the active position of the cutting strands in the cutting head. According to the invention, the convergent relative axial movements of the housing and the squeezing mechanism are obtained through the manual axial displacement of the exterior housing. According to another characteristic disposition, the divergent relative axial movements of the housing and the strand-holding assembly which result in the locking of the cutting strands are obtained automatically through the action of an elastic means of return. According to an interesting embodiment, this elastic means of return is constituted by a spring acting in compression and interposed between an interior partition in the upper part of the exterior housing and the support of the clamping mechanism, so as to allow the automatic blockage of the cutting strands following their positioning in the cutting head. According to an advantageous embodiment, the support of the clamping mechanism comprises two guiding and positioning channels for the cutting strands, located in parallel on either side of the rotational axis of the cutting head, an inlet portion of each of these channels is uncovered, and the pivoting squeezing element of each squeezing device is mounted opposite this uncovered portion. Preferably, each of these squeezing elements is constituted by a cam featuring a squeezing surface and a lateral shoulder presenting a cam-shaped profile. According to a preferred embodiment, the drive shaft and the axial passage made in the support of the clamping mechanism present a complementary profile that is adapted to allow the rotational drive of the cutting head. The cutting head according to the invention provides several interesting advantages. It is very simple to manufacture and to use. The insertion of the cutting strands, their adjustment depending on the mowing or brush-cutting work to be performed, their retraction and their replacement due to wear or breakage can be done very easily and very quickly and do not require any tooling, no matter how basic. As it is possible to manually unlock the cutting strands, they can be removed on the same side as the one which served for their insertion into the cutting head. This necessarily avoids having to let the strands stick out, on the opposite side of the orifice reserved for their insertion, which allows shortening the length of the dropped pieces (worn or broken strands). It is thus possible to use longer cutting strands than those used for equipping the known machines. The operator can, after partial wear of the wire, easily unlock said wire from its first position and make it come out in reverse direction of its direction of insertion to compensate for said wear and to optimize the drop-offs of wire no longer usable (in the known machines the drop-offs are significant because a not negligible portion of the length of cutting strands cannot be used). This saves wire and time as wires are replaced less often. The peripheral wall of the exterior housing is provided with openings for the insertion of cutting strands and openings for extraction that are opposite to them and, according to an advantageous embodiment, these openings present an elongated shape oriented parallel to the rotational axis of the housing. The elongated shape of these openings or lateral slots makes it possible, during relative movements of the exterior housing with respect to the support of the clamping mechanism, that said movements are not blocked by the cutting strands when these are engaged in the cutting head. According to another characteristic disposition, the cutting head features an axial drive shaft that is suitable for being coupled to a motorization, this drive shaft being integral in rotation of the support of the clamping mechanism. According to an interesting embodiment, the exterior housing and the support of the clamping mechanism are integral in rotation. According to a preferred embodiment, the rotational drive of the exterior housing is achieved through the intermediary of the support of the clamping mechanism. According to a preferred embodiment, the rotational coupling of the support of the clamping mechanism and the exterior housing is achieved by means of drive studs integral with the interior partition of the exterior housing and oriented parallel to the rotational axis of the cutting head, these drive studs being engaged, with an aptitude of sliding in the grooves made in the support of the clamping mechanism, preferably in at least two opposing sides of the latter. According to a characteristic disposition, the clamping mechanism comprises two squeezing devices for the cutting strands positioned on both sides of the axial drive shaft, each enabling the positioning and locking of a cutting strand. According to an advantageous embodiment, the support of the clamping mechanism is provided with two positioning channels of the cutting strands, located parallel, on both sides of the axial drive shaft of the cutting head, and of which at least one inlet portion is uncovered, the swinging component (cams, preferably) of the squeezing devices being mounted so they face this open portion and are subjected to the action of a spring tending to apply its active surface in direction of said uncovered portion, so as to press the cutting strand engaged in the positioning channel against the bottom of the latter, thus ensuring the blockage of said cutting strand, the exterior housing being provided, internally, with pushing fingers to make said cams pivot in order to remove the pressure of these on the cutting strands during convergent axial movements of the exterior housing and of the strand-holding positioning.

  "negative": "This invention refers broadly to devices and techniques for non-invasive evaluation of cardiovascular performance. Specifically, the invention targets a method for approximating heart chamber volume by interpreting acoustic signals from cardiac activity. Unlike previous diagnostic machines that rely on intrusive catheter insertion or contrast agents, this technology uses surface skin-mounted acoustic sensors. These sensors capture heart-generated sounds, whose characteristics are transformed into volumetric estimations of cardiac chambers without the introduction of substances or probes into the body. In this manner, the invention aims to provide accessibility and safety in cardiac monitoring, while being sizable for ambulatory applications or in-patient procedures, bringing down healthcare costs through resource-efficient technology.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for non-invasively measuring aortic blood flow in a patient. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and method for determining aortic blood flow by measuring the pressure differential between the left and right subclavian arteries. 2. Description of the Related Art In a conventional flow apparatus and method, aortic blood flow is measured by one of several techniques that involve injection of a &#34;bolus&#34; of foreign material into the ventricle of the heart or into the aorta. The movement of the &#34;bolus&#34; is then monitored by thermal or nuclear (x-ray, gamma ray) sensors. All of these techniques have the severe disadvantage of being invasive. The foreign material injected is usually harmless, but some patients may have adverse reactions to it. These procedures usually must be performed in a &#34;cath lab&#34;, which is a relatively expensive facility. This, in addition to the need for the services of a skilled cardiologist, make these procedures relatively expensive. An alternative conventional apparatus and method uses ultrasonic imaging techniques to measure the blood flow velocity profile in the aorta. Total volumetric blood flow can be found by integration of the velocity profile. However, this method is very sensitive to movement artifacts. The equipment is also too large and sensitive to movements to be used on an ambulatory patient, or during surgery. The equipment is also relatively expensive. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A general object of the invention is to provide an improved method and apparatus for non-invasive measurement of blood flow in the aorta. A second object is to provide simultaneous, non-invasive measurement of aortic blood flow and blood pressure. A third object is to provide a non-invasive measurement of cardiac output. A fourth object is to provide a method and an apparatus to accomplish the above objects more cost-effectively than conventional methods and apparatuses. A fifth object is to provide a method and an apparatus to accomplish the above objects which is more resistant to movement artifacts. A sixth object is to provide an improved method and apparatus for measurement of blood pressure, cardiac output, and other cardiovascular parameters during an exercise stress test. A seventh object is to measure cardiac output with an apparatus that is practical for routine use in clinical anesthesia. The present invention overcomes several shortcomings of conventional aortic blood flow measurement apparatuses and methods. It is completely non-invasive. The apparatus is relatively small, lightweight, and inexpensive. The apparatus comprises one small sensor attached to each of the patient&#39;s wrists. No sensors are placed on or near the patient&#39;s chest. Thus, the method and apparatus of the present invention may be used during thoracic surgery and heart massage to monitor cardiac output in real time. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The preferred embodiments will be described with reference to the drawings, in which the elements have been denoted by like reference numerals throughout the figures, and in which: FIG. 1 is a ventral view of an aorta; FIG. 2 is a schematic view of the apparatus of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the offset correction means; and FIG. 4 is a graph showing the pressure/flow relationship. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The anatomy of the aortic arch 10 and, in particular, of the subclavian arteries 11 and 12, is shown in FIG. 1. Blood ejected by the left ventricle of the heart enters the arch at its proximate end 13. Blood destined for the legs and torso exits the arch at its distal end 14. As shown in this illustration, the right subclavian artery is located on the aortic arch 10 about 2 or 3 cm &#34;upstream&#34; of the left subclavian artery 12. This 2-cm section of the aorta, together with the two subclavian arteries, can be used to form a capillary-(or orifice-) type flowmeter. Specifically, the subclavian artery pressures are measured indirectly by means of arterial blood pressure sensors placed on arteries of the arms 22 of a patient 20, as shown in FIG. 2. The brachial arteries, radial arteries, ulnar arteries or even finger arteries can be used. Likewise, any known blood pressure sensor can be used. However, in the preferred embodiment, a tonometer-type blood pressure sensor 24 is applied to the radial artery of each arm 22. The difference between the two subclavian artery pressures is directly related to the instantaneous blood flow in the aortic arch 10. Thus, the aortic arch 10 is used as the flow-to-pressure transducer of a capillary-type flowmeter. It is arguable that the configuration is more similar to an orifice-type flowmeter. However, this is merely a semantic distinction. FIG. 2 shows the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention for aortic blood flow measurement in schematic form. As shown in FIG. 2, an arterial tonometer blood pressure sensor 24 is applied to each wrist of the patient 20 to measure pressure in the left and right radial arteries. A blood pressure cuff (not shown) may optionally be used on one or both of the patient&#39;s arms 22 for determination of coefficients to be used in signal processing software of the tonometry system, emergency blood pressure measurements, and other purposes. The apparatus of the preferred embodiment includes two sensor control means 26. Each sensor control means 26 typically comprises one or more microprocessors and &#34;DSP chips&#34; and is connected to one tonometer sensor 24. Each sensor control means 26 processes the sensor signals, positions the sensor 24, adjusts the hold-down pressure (HDP) of the sensor 24 against the patient&#39;s wrist, applies calibration (if any) to the sensor signals, and outputs a signal 26a representing the instantaneous blood pressure in one of the radial arteries. These are functions used in arterial tonometry and are shown, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,836,213 and 4,987,900. Each radial arterial blood pressure signal is subjected to further processing prior to final display, as shown in FIG. 2. First, each blood pressure signal 26a is output by one of the sensor control means 26 to a corresponding equalization device 28. Each equalization device 28 models the inverse of the transfer function between the pressure at the aortic anastomosis of the left or right subclavian artery and the sensor location on the corresponding radial artery. Since the vasculature of the two arms is very similar, the two equalization devices 28 will generally have similar transfer functions, but they need not be identical. These transfer functions may be may be tailored to each individual patient 20 based on age, weight, and other factors. After processing by the corresponding equalization device 28, each equalized signal 28a may be output to a corresponding offset correction device 30 or may be output directly to a differential amplifier 32. Each offset correction device 30 (described in detail below) corrects for small inaccuracies in the flow signal that would be caused by any &#34;DC offset&#34; between the two sensor signals. Each signal output by either the corresponding offset correction device 30 or the corresponding equalization device 28 is input to one input terminal of the differential amplifier 32. The differential amplifier 32 generates a difference signal 32a equal to the amplified difference between the two input signals. The difference signal 32a is roughly proportional to the instantaneous blood flow in the aortic arch 10. The difference signal 32a output by the differential amplifier 32 is input to a pressure-to-flow transformation device 34. This transformation device 34 can be implemented with a microprocessor or &#34;DSP chip&#34; and converts the difference signal, which represents the pressure drop in the 2-cm section of the aorta 10 between the right and left subclavian arteries 11 and 12, to the flow signal, which represents the instantaneous flow rate of blood in that 2-cm section. The transformation device 34 is well-known to those skilled in the art of flowmeters. For example, for an orifice-type flow sensor, flow is related to pressure by: ##EQU1## where q is the flow, C is a coefficient (fixed for a given fluid and flowmeter), P 2 is the pressure downstream of the flow sensor, and P 1 is the pressure upstream of the sensor. For this type of flow sensor, the pressure-to-flow transformation device 34 simply implements the equation, ##EQU2## where \u0394P represents the input to the device 32a (P 1 -P 2 ). While the behavior of the aortic arch 10 will be more complex than that of a simple, orifice-type flow sensor, the overall method and means for determining flow based on a pressure difference that is monotonically and directly related to the flow is identical. The present invention exploits this behavior to determine aortic blood flow from the easily measured pressure difference between the two subclavian arteries 11 and 12. At low flow rates, the flow will be laminar, and the pressure drop, \u0394P, is directly proportional to flow. This regime is known as Hagen-Poiseuille flow. The rate of change in pressure per unit length, dp/dx is: ##EQU3## where V is the average blood velocity, \u03bc is the viscosity of the blood, and r o is the internal radius of the aorta 10. This expression may be rewritten for the pressure drop, \u0394P, generated by flow through a vessel of length, \u0394X, as follows: ##EQU4## An expression for the blood flow rate q, integrated over cross-section of the aorta 10, is: q=\u03c0r.sub.o.sup.2 \u03c1V, (5) where \u03c1 is the blood density. Now, substituting V from Eq. (5) into Eq. (4) and rearranging gives: ##EQU5## Thus, the laminar blood flow rate q is directly proportional to the pressure drop \u0394P, and the proportionality constant is composed of parameters that are essentially fixed for a given patient. In the aorta 10, \u0394x is the distance--about 2 cm--between the anastomoses of the two subclavian arteries 11 and 12. The laminar flow relationship given in Eq. (6) holds only for relatively-low flow velocities, up to a Reynold&#39;s number, Re, of about 1,000 to 5,000. The line 38 shown in FIG. 4 graphically represents the laminar flow region defined by Eq. (6). At relatively high flow velocities, the flow is turbulent. In this regime, the friction factor, f, will asymptotically approach a constant value, which depends on the roughness of the aortic walls. The friction factor f ##EQU6## where \u0394P is the pressure drop between the two measurement points, \u03c1 is blood density, V is average flow velocity, L is the distance between the two measurement points, and D is the diameter of the vessel. Solving for average blood flow velocity: ##EQU7## Solving Eq. (5) for V gives: ##EQU8## Now substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (8) and solving for q gives; ##EQU9## Then, solving for q gives: ##EQU10## Thus, the flow rate q is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop \u0394P in turbulent flow. In measuring aortic blood flow, the proportionality constant is composed of parameters that are essentially fixed for a given patient. Curve 40 of FIG. 4 graphically represents the turbulent flow region defined by Eq. (11). As shown by curve 38 of FIG. 4, for low velocity laminar flow the flow rate is proportional to \u0394P, and the proportionality constant is \u03c1\u03c0r o 4 /8\u03bc\u0394x. As shown by curve 40 of FIG. 4, for high velocity turbulent flows the flow rate is proportional to the square root of \u0394P and the proportionality constant is \u03c0(\u03c1r o 5 /2f\u0394x) 1/2. For flow rates lying between these regimes, the behavior is intermediate between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes, as shown by curve 36. The important result is that the flow rate is related in an essentially-fixed, monotonic way to the subclavian pressure difference, \u0394P. The exact shape of the actual aortic pressure/flow curve 36 of FIG. 4 cannot be obtained mathematically with the same ease as the curves in the laminar flow and turbulent flow regions described above. However, it is straightforward to measure the q versus \u0394P relationship either with live patients, with cadavers, or with physical models, fabricated by casting from cadavers. After the q versus \u0394P relationship has been measured for a range of body types and sizes, this information is used in the apparatus of the present invention so that a patient&#39;s blood flow can be measured with a fair degree of accuracy. This is accomplished without need to determine the precise q versus \u0394P relationship for that particular patient, simply by using the predetermined stored q versus \u0394P curves. The q versus \u0394P relationship for any particular patient is implemented in the transformation device. The relationship may be implemented using any known means such as by being selected from a stored table provided in a memory means. It is also useful to note that corrections can be made for curved flow channels. The aorta 10 is certainly curved, so these corrections should ideally be considered in any attempt to derive a q versus \u0394P relationship by analytical methods. An important aspect of the flow measurement technique described here is that the measurement depends on the (relatively small) difference between two large signals, the equalized and corrected left and right blood pressure signals. A small (percentage) error in either blood pressure signal will lead to a relatively large error in the measurement of blood flow. The various sources of small errors in tonometric blood pressure measurements are well-known. If the offset correction devices 30 are not used, these small errors would be large enough to cause unacceptable errors in the aortic blood flow measurement. Thus, the offset correction devices 30 have an important influence on the accuracy of the measurement system. Except for certain situations such as vigorous exercise, the aortic blood flow is highly pulsatile, and drops essentially to zero during the later part (i.e., just prior to left ventricle contraction) of the cardiac cycle. This behavior is used by the offset correction devices 30 to correct the sensor signals. During this zero-flow part of the cardiac cycle, the pressures in the two subclavian arteries and 12 will be essentially equal, and hence, their pressure difference should be nearly equal to zero. As shown in FIG. 2, one of the two offset correction devices 30 is optional. In the most general case, two offset correction devices 30 are used, but one offset correction device 30 is sufficient for most situations. When only one offset correction device 30 is used, the output from one equalization device 28a is input directly to the differential amplifier 32. The operation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 will be described for the case of a single offset correction device 30, which is installed in the line carrying the left artery pressure signal. The sensor control means 26 detects the diastolic and systolic points on the radial blood pressure waveforms. Algorithms to identify these points are wellknown. Based on these identified points, each sensor control means 26 outputs a timing signal 26b that indicates the occurrence of the zero-flow part of the cardiac cycle. For example, let t a be the running average of the period of the cardiac cycle. Assume the cycle starts at the systolic point of the right radial artery pressure waveform. One algorithm for finding the zero-flow part of the cycle would begin the zero-flow segment at t\u2243(0.8)t a and would end it at a time 4 ms prior to the diastolic point of the right radial artery pressure signal. This algorithm is offered as a good example, but other algorithms may be used without departing from the teachings of this invention. The timing signals 26b are input to the offset correction device 30. Each offset correction device 30 preferably uses the timing signal 26b from the opposite arm. That is, the first offset device 30 preferably uses the second timing signal 26b, while the second offset correction device (if implemented) preferably uses the first timing signal 26b. Alternatively, each offset correction device 30 uses the same arm timing signal 26b, or uses both timing signals 26b. A second input to each offset correction device 30 is the amplified signal 32a output by the differential amplifier 32. The output of the differential amplifier 32 should be zero during the zero-flow part of the cardiac cycle. This zero-output condition is achieved by operation of the offset correction device 30 as described below. The operation of the offset correction device 30 can be understood by referring to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 shows the internal components of the offset correction device 30. The amplified signal 32a output by the differential amplifier 32 is input to an integrator circuit 302. This integrator circuit 302 is controlled in the conventional manner by the timing signals 26b. Specifically, the output from integrator circuit 302 is reset to zero just prior to the beginning of the zero-flow time period. During the zero-flow part of the cardiac cycle, as indicated by the timing signals 26b, the integrator circuit 302 integrates the amplified signal 32a and outputs a signal equal to the integral. When the zero-flow time period ends, the integrator circuit 302 ceases to integrate its input, and the level of its output signal is &#34;frozen&#34;. This sort of integrator circuit 302 is well-known in the art. The output signal from the integrator circuit 302 is input to a three-state comparator 304. The three-state comparator 304 has three output states that correspond to the input\u2267d, input\u2266-d, and d&gt;input&gt;-d, respectively, where d is a threshold voltage In the preferred embodiment, d is chosen to represent a very small pressure--e.g. 0.01 mmHg. The output signal from the three-state comparator 304 is input to the logic circuit 306 shown in FIG. 3. Second inputs to the logic circuit 306 are the timing signals 26b. The signals output by the logic circuit 306 are input to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 308. Immediately after the end of the zero-flow time period, the logic circuit 306 is activated. First, the logic circuit 306 reads the output from the three-state comparator 304 to determine its state."

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is generally related to the meat processing industry and is specifically related to an apparatus and method for determining the source of and controlling variations in comminuted meat products. 2. Discussion of the Prior Art The meat processing industry is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the basis of the chemical analysis of finished products which are marketed to the consumer. Sample lots of products are drawn on a periodic basis by USDA inspectors for chemical analysis to verify compliance with the quality control regulations. Usually, such sampling will actually be done by the meat processing company laboratory after having been certified for accuracy by the USDA. If a meat product analysis indicates a lack of compliance to the standards, the inspector will denote the entire lot of the meat products as being &#34;retained&#34; which means not only that that &#34;lot&#34; must be reworked and cannot be shipped, but that there will be a tightened inspection in the future. Because of the cost associated with a &#34;retained&#34; lot, meat processors are careful to target their final product content so that violations of the USDA requirements are relatively small. Meat processing is subject to numerous sources of variation, not found in other industries, making the problem of product consistency quite difficult. Raw meat trimmings are sold to meat processors based upon the fat content and incoming lots are routinely analyzed by the meat processor to check for the supplier&#39;s contractual compliance. Variations of fat content within \u00b12% of standard are considered acceptable, although this criteria is normally applied on the high fat side. The USDA also regulates &#34;USDA Added Water&#34; which is defined by the USDA as &#34;moisture -4\u00d7protein.&#34; Regulation of processed meat products such as sausage, e.g., franks, bologna, luncheon meats, etc., is based upon maximum limits on the fat and &#34;USDA Added Water&#34; content of the consumer product. Raw meat materials are typically blended together in a partial batch called a &#34;preblend&#34; or an &#34;uncorrected&#34; blend, which is then sampled and chemically analyzed. Based upon the analysis, the remaining material is added in adjusted amounts to &#34;correct&#34; the preblend to the target specification which may be a slightly conservative version of the USDA regulations governing the particular meat products. The adjusted &#34;final&#34; or &#34;corrected&#34; blend is then comminuted and passed to the stuffing department, where it is injected into casings. The product is then cooked, cooled, casings removed and packaged for shipping. Meat processors normally conduct their own quality assurance testing to provide advance notice of possible regulatory noncompliance. Such testing normally involves chemical analysis of sampled lots for moisture, fat, protein and USDA Added Water (USDA AW). The principal sources in variation in finished product analyses result from three sources at the meat processing company. First, there is a variation in composition of the final blend or &#34;emulsion&#34; related to the actual blending step. Other variations in &#34;emulsion&#34; analysis may result from improper material use or weights, errors in assumed raw meat analysis, laboratory errors in the preblend analysis, if performed, etc. Secondly, there are variations due to moisture loss during the cooking and holding times (this moisture loss is commonly called &#34;shrinkage&#34;). Additional &#34;shrinkage&#34; variations occur in moisture shrink loss resulting from improper smokehouse loading or schedules, faulty smokehouse equipment, abnormal holding times, etc. Thirdly, a variation is introduced in the imprecision of the laboratory analysis for moisture, fat and protein. The laboratory analysis error can be particularly critical since protein analysis is weighted by a factor of 4 in the definition of the USDA AW. Minor variations in the protein analysis can result from insufficient mixing or comminution of the laboratory sample, the very small test weights utilized (typically 2 grams for the protein test) and variations between personnel, improper times of digestion, extraction or distillation. Because of the large number of sources of variations encountered in meat processing, it is difficult to identify and remove assignable causes of product variation. As a result, processors must reduce their fat and USDA AW targets to provide a statistical margin of error to avoid any significant retainage. This conservative estimate of fat and USDA AW target specifications results in a &#34;giveaway&#34; in product analysis resulting in a 1-5% increased product cost. Therefore, it can be seen that the ability to provide product closer to a 1% cost rather than a 5% cost results in a significant cost savings and increased profit to the meat processor. It is therefore extremely desirable in the meat processing industry to have reasonable estimates on the sizes of these three principal sources of variation in finished product analysis so that active correction action may be taken to reduce and control them. Obviously, a reduction in product chemical variability immediately results in a reduced cost of production by reducing the amount of the &#34;giveaway.&#34; An estimation of the sizes of the three principal sources of product variation allows quick troubleshooting of problems so as to correct the area of production, i.e., blending, postblending or laboratory. In the past, estimation of the blending variation could only be done by actual sampling and chemical analysis of samples of the final blend of meat, preferably after final comminution before stuffing into casings. The between-lots standard deviations of moisture and fat for the same product target specifications measure and provide an indication of the &#34;uncorrected&#34; blend variation. However, obtaining this extra sampling and analysis results in significant additional costs being incurred for this process monitoring. In the past there has been no accepted method for determination of overall product moisture loss (&#34;shrinkage&#34;) from the stuffing phase to the final packaging phase. The common practice has been to measure and monitor the principal component of shrink loss, that due to cooking, by weighing racked products in and out of the smokehouse. These measurements have many sources of error which limit their use for process control and include: difficulty and expense of taring (the initial zero weighing process of the racks) and identifying the racks accurately; inadvertent movement of the product from tared racks to others; loss of spray coatings of smoke treatments (which result in apparent shrinkage); lack of care by plant personnel in weighing in a busy production environment, etc. Also significant is a lack of measurement of the pre-cook and post-cook shrinkages, which can amount to several percent and can vary from batch-to-batch due to differences in holding times, etc. Errors in the finished product laboratory analyses are difficult to detect and measure. Because of the unique lot analyses, the perishable and changeable nature of the products, small lab sample sizes, etc., it is difficult to reproduce the exact condition of a test in two different laboratories. Although laboratories may be &#34;certified&#34; by comparative studies with the USDA and standard methods of analysis are used, it is notorious in the industry that values obtained by the USDA laboratories, or even by outside testing laboratories, cannot in general be trusted as a definitive measure of the &#34;true&#34; analysis. As a consequence, meat processing companies generally have no good idea of the exact precision and accuracy of its own laboratory. Some companies will validate their results by a between-methods comparison of moisture or fat values obtained by two different instruments or techniques. However, the effectiveness of such tests varies with the type of sample and product and generally the process of determining precision of this method is too burdensome to carry out for each and every product. It should be noted that the protein measurement analysis is particularly critical and there is currently only one accepted standard method for protein analysis. Therefore, with this measurement a &#34;between-methods&#34; measurement of precision cannot be attempted. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Because all meat processors perform daily analyses of their products for moisture, fat, protein and USDA AW (or some subset of these), large numbers of such analyses are accumulated over time but are used only for negative results (i.e., general indication of variable products). The present invention is to utilize the outgoing product analyses to diagnose the sources and sizes of product variation in order to permit isolation of causes of such variation so they may be removed, reduced or otherwise controlled. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for estimating and evaluating the acceptability of lot-to-lot process variations for a blended meat product made to a constant target or specification and providing a correction control to the processing input steps. According to the present invention a set of good assumptions are made which render it unnecessary to obtain direct measurements of either the moisture content of the emulsion or the shrink. Standard deviations of two unknowns are estimated on the basis of historical experience. It is then possible to directly calculate a third unknown, which is a standard deviation that is critical to the accuracy of the overall process. More specifically, there are three such standard deviations which are critical: moisture content of the blend; shrink that occurs during cooking; and laboratory error in measurement of protein content of the cooked product. The present invention makes it possible to obtain a fairly precise calculation of each of these three unknowns by first making reasonable assumptions as to the values of the other two. In a preferred embodiment of applicant&#39;s invention, data from which it is possible to determine blend variation, moisture-loss variation and/or protein analysis variation of the blended meat product is inputted through a keyboard and stored in a data storage. These process variations in the meat product are calculated based upon the data stored in said data storage and displayed by an appropriate display means. Advantageously, applicant&#39;s invention may be conveniently implemented in a preprogrammed hand-held calculator and the method may be advantageously implemented by utilizing the calculated process variation information in a feedback loop to automatically control the variables in the desired meat processing steps. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Various embodiments of applicant&#39;s invention may be better understood by reference to the following drawings wherein: FIG. 1 comprises a block diagram of an apparatus according to applicant&#39;s invention; FIG. 2a through 2g are a flowchart of the steps taken in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 3 is a flowchart diagram of applicant&#39;s inventive method as applied to an automated meat processing system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown an overall block diagram of a simple embodiment of the applicant&#39;s invention. A keyboard 10 is utilized to input parameters, as measured values or estimates, which comprise information relating to blend variation, moisture-loss variation and protein analysis variation of the meat products being considered. This information is supplied to a data storage means 12 which stores the information in a Random Access Memory (RAM). Calculator 14 is suitably programmed, for example by program storage 18, so as to access the memory of data storage 12 and process the information in an appropriate fashion so as to provide the desired process variations of the meat products which can be supplied as a control output to effect improvements in an automated meat processing system and/or provided to a display 16 in order to permit an operator to review the output and then make the desired processing step corrections. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is implemented with a Sharp brand hand-held PC 1350/1360 pocket computer which includes an electronically-programmable read-only memory (EPROM). The EPROM is loaded prior to operation with a suitable program, a source listing of which is attached as Appendix A hereto.

Obtain estimates of, or calculate from measurements, average moisture M, average fat F, average protein P and average Added Water AW and of standard deviations s M , s F , s P and s AW , respectively. These can be inputted directly by means of the keyboard means or other data input device, or as computed from measured characteristics of outgoing product after shrinkage. Obtain estimates of the standard deviations of the between sample laboratory error in moisture s m , fat s f , and protein s p. If the standard deviations of s m , s f , s p are not known (which is usually the case), the program initially uses 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, which have been determined as typical in such systems. If the final blend is a &#34;corrected&#34; blend, s B is set to 0.4% and if an &#34;uncorrected&#34; blend, s B is set to 1.0%. 2. An estimate of the average processing moisture shrink loss (s) from uncooked emulsion to the time of lab analysis is also inputted. This number is typically 3-15% for typical cooked sausage products and can be more or less for other products. 3. The terms s aw 2 and Y are calculated in accordance with Equations 1 and 2 as follows, where the term represented by s aw 2 is the laboratory Added Water variance and Y is a function of the measured Added Water variance (related to the standard deviation of Added Water for the samples): s.sub.aw.sup.2 =s.sub.m.sup.2 +16s.sub.p.sup.2 Eqn. 1 Y=0.7\u00d7s.sub.AW.sup.2 Eqn. 2 The calculations of the two terms are compared and if s aw 2 is greater than or equal to Y, then the lab error is too large and the term &#34;Lab Error Too Large&#34; is displayed. 4. Shrink variance is computed based upon the following: ##EQU1## In equations 3 and 4, the x indicates a multiplication function and the standard deviation of moisture in blend s B is assumed to be 0.4% if &#34;correction is used and 1.0% if not. The term 0.1 is an estimate (viz. 1.0-4\u00d70.275) of the contribution of the meat composition variation to Added Water variation, and the term 0.275 is an estimate of the ratio of standard deviation of protein to that of moisture due to raw meat composition variations. The factor of 0.275 is a compromise which represents with reasonable accuracy the bulk of processed meats produced in North America. The factor varies from 0.2 for comminuted chicken or turkey meat to 0.3 for chicken or turkey or beef or pork muscle meat. Since the meat processor is aware of the species composition of his products, under ideal circumstances he could compute the weighted average by composition of the individual species&#39; factors and use this value to replace the value 0.275 as well as 1.0-4\u00d7value to replace 0.1 in equation 3 as follows: Value=0.20\u00d7% Comminuted Chicken+0.20\u00d7% Comminuted Turkey+0.24\u00d7% Mutton Muscle Meat+ 0.26\u00d7% Chicken Muscle Meat+0.26\u00d7% Turkey Muscle Meat+0.27\u00d7% Pork Muscle Meat+0.28\u00d7% Beef Muscle Meat where the numerical coefficients are determined by correlation analysis of measured chemical content of the meat, and the % compositions are of meat protein (ideally) or simply of meat in the blend. Generally the difference from the value 0.275 will not be significant except possibly in the case that all of the meat is from comminuted poultry. 5. Determine whether the results are reasonable. If s s 2 is less than zero, then the phrase &#34;Results Not Sensible&#34; is reported and the analysis terminates by returning to the beginning of the process. Otherwise, s s is reported and stored as the computed standard deviation of shrink. 6. s s is compared to 1% and if greater than 1% the display indicates &#34;Exceeds 1%.&#34; This warning indicates that the cooking steps are too variable for good process control. If the standard deviation of shrink is less than 0.5%, the phrase &#34;Too Small (less than 0.5%)&#34; is displayed, indicating an abnormally low, and possibly incorrect, estimate of shrink variation was found. 7. Lab protein is calculated in accordance with the following equation: s.sub.p.sup.2 =s.sub.p.sup.2 -s.sub.s.sup.2 \u00d7[P/(1-s)].sup.2 -[0.275 s.sub.B / (1-s)].sup.2 Eqn. 4 If s p 2 is less than zero, then &#34;Protein Error Too Small&#34; is reported since it apparently cannot be computed accurately. If s p is greater than 0.32%, then the term &#34;exceeds 0.3%&#34; is reported which indicates excessive lab protein analysis error although the system continues."

  "negative": "The subject invention relates to novel peptide structures that function to restrict nutrient absorption in select arthropods, thereby impeding their reproductive processes. Specifically, the peptides showcased are intended for application on arthropods that consume plant saps. The invention distinctly demonstrates the synthesis of two peptides with the following structures: H2N--YDPAP--COOH and H2N--YDPAP4--COOH. These compounds have been found to manifest biological effects on insects such as the whitefly, which are key in the spread of phytoviruses. The peptides are white crystalline substances highly soluble in aqueous solutions and can be manufactured using industrial peptide synthesizers. These peptides are stable across a range of pH levels (5-9) and exhibit resistance to enzymatic degradation present in whitefly homogenates. They are hence considered promising agents for the inhibition of whitefly populations. Furthermore, the invention entails the potential modification of peptides by adding protective groups at the N-terminus or C-terminus to mitigate metabolic degradation, and the inclusion of D-conformation amino acids which offer resistance to protease disintegration. Additionally, the invention delves into deoxyribonucleic acid sequences that encode for the production of the peptides, promising an advanced method for the creation of transformed organisms capable of producing the peptides in situ, such as bacteria and plants, which, upon consumption by sap-feeding insects, could exert the desired inhibitory effects on nutrient absorption processes.\n\n",
  "pos": "This invention was made with government support under USDA Research Grant No. CRCR 1-2394. The government has certain rights in this invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The existence of antigonadotropins or hormones that inhibit egg development has been demonstrated in the cockroach, eye gnat, crustaceans, house fly, and mosquitoes. Such hormones can be generally characterized as oostatic hormones. In 1985, Borovsky purified an oostatic hormone 7,000-fold and disclosed that injection of a hormone preparation into the body cavity of blood imbibed insects caused inhibition of egg development and sterility in insects (Borovsky, D. [1985] Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2:333-349). Following these observations, Borovsky, D. (1988) Arch. Ins. Biochem. Physiol. 7:187-210 disclosed that injection or passage of a peptide hormone preparation into blood sucking insects caused inhibition in the biosynthesis of serine esterase, trypsin-like and chyrnotrypsin-like enzymes in the epithelium cells of the gut. Since trypsin is the major proteolytic enzyme synthesized in this insect (about 70-80%), the blood meal is not digested efficiently and, consequently, free amino acids needed for the synthesis of the yolk protein synthesis in the fat body are not released into the hemolymph. Yolk protein is not synthesized and yolk is not deposited in the ovaries. The result is arrested egg development in the treated insect. The oostatic hormone peptides do not have an effect when inside the gut or other parts of the digestive system (Borovsky, D. [1988], supra). Despite the 7,000-fold purification reported by Borovsky in 1985, the oostatic hormone was not obtained in essentially pure form and no amino acid sequence had been or could be obtained. Subsequently, the isolated peptide, trypsin modulating oostatic factor (TMOF), and two analogs of that peptide, were disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,909 and 5,130,253, and in a 1990 publication (Borovsky, D., D. A. Carlson, P. R. Griffin, J. Shabanowitz, D. F. Hunt [1990] FASEB J. 4:3015-3020). It is believed that TMOF can be rapidly inactivated in the gut of a mosquito by the action of enzymes. An endopeptidase isolated from Pseudornonas fragi (Charbonneau, H. [1989] A Practical Guide to Proteins and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing (P. T. Matsudaira, ed.), Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif., pp. 15-30) was shown to hydrolyze peptide bonds on the N-terminus of Asp (D). Such an enzyme may have a role in the mosquito in regulating TMOF or its analogs by hydrolyzing the N-terminus (Tyr) from the rest of the molecule, thus inactivating the hormone. Another possibility is that the hormone may be hydrolyzed by a proline iminopeptidase-like enzyme after the hormone is cleaved, or by a pronase-like enzyme that can digest polymers of L-proline (Sober, H. A. [1968] Handbook of Biochem., The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, Ohio, pp. C70). Since both the N- and C-termini of TMOF are not blocked, TMOF and its analogs could be hydrolyzed by both amino- and carboxypeptides or by endopeptidases that have been shown to play an important role in the metabolism of peptide hormones in insects and mammals (Rayne, R. C., M. O&#39;Shea [1992] Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 22:24-34; Schwartz, J.-C., B. Malfroy, S. De La Baume [1981] Life Sciences 29:1715-1740). The rapid increase in pesticide resistance of disease-borne arthropods makes our hormonal approach a safer alternative to the chemical approach (e.g., synthetic pyrethroid, organochlorine, and organophosphates). However, the utility of the tulllength TMOF hormone agent is limited to some extent by the rapid inactivation of this hormone by digestive enzymes. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention concerns novel peptide hormones that inhibit digestion in pests, thus causing sterility (inhibition of egg development) in the treated pests. In a preferred embodiment, the peptides of the subject invention are used for the control of pests, such as mosquitoes, which ingest blood. The subject invention specifically exemplifies two novel peptides having the formulas: (1) H 2 N--YDPAP--COOH (SEQ ID NO. 1) (P1); and (2) H 2 N--YDPAP 4 --COOH (SEQ ID NO. 4) (P4). Both compounds have biological activity against, for example, Aedes aegypti. The novel peptides of the invention are particularly active against blood-sucking insects, particularly against species of mosquitoes such as Aeries aegypti that are potential vectors of arthropod-borne vital diseases (arboviruses). These insect species utilize setinc esterases (trypsin and chymotrypsin-like enzymes) as their primary blood digesting enzymes. The compounds of the subject invention are white powders that are highly soluble in water. They can be synthesized on a commercial peptide synthesizer. These peptides are highly stable in water solution at different pHs (5-9). Peptide (1) was allowed to stand at room temperature in solution of mosquito homogenate (including their digestive enzymes) for two weeks without loss of activity. Thus, these peptides are particularly attractive for the control of mosquitoes and other pests. Another advantage of the penta- and octa-peptides of the subject invention is that they are more rapidly absorbed in the insect gut. Surprisingly, these short peptides are highly active. Thus, the novel peptides display a more rapid action, a decreased chance for insect gut enzymes to proteolyze the peptide, and high activity. The peptides were not affected by 1% trifluoroacetic acid and were routinely purified using this acid on HPLC. Also included in this invention are addition salts, complexes, or prodrugs such as esters of the peptides of this invention, especially the nontoxic pharmaceutically or agriculturally acceptable acid addition salts. The acid addition salts are prepared in standard manner in a suitable solvent from the parent compound and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, maleic, succinic, ethanedisulfonic or methanesulfonic acids. The formulas have two weak acidic groups (carboxyl groups) on the aspattic acid (D) and on the proline (P) at the carboxyl end. Thus, esterification at these groups to form derivatives such as the methyl or ethyl esters, can be prepared by standard procedures. The N-terminus and C-terminus of the peptides can be blocked to further inhibit proteolysis by metabolic enzymes. Derivation of peptides to block the N-terminus or C-terminus is known in the art. For example, the N-terminus can be acetylated by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art; the C-terminus can be amidated as is well known in the art. The novel peptides can also be synthesized wherein at least one of the amino acids is in the D-conformation, as opposed to the naturally occurring L-rotation conformation. The presence of D-conformation amino acids can inhibit the ability of proteases to degrade the peptides of the subject invention. Also, derivation of these compounds with long chain hydrocarbons will facilitate passage through the cuticle into the pest body cavity. Therefore, a further embodiment of the subject invention pertains to compositions comprising the peptides bound to lipids or other carriers. A further aspect of the subject invention pertains to DNA sequences encoding the peptides disclosed herein. These DNA sequences can easily be synthesized by a person skilled in the art. The sequences may be used to transform an appropriate host to confer upon that host the ability to express the novel peptides. Hosts of particular interest include bacteria, yeasts, insect viruses, and plants. For each of these hosts, the DNA sequences may be specifically designed by a person skilled in the art to utilize codons known to be optimally expressed in the particular hosts. Advantageous promoters can also easily be utilized. Bacteria, yeasts, and viruses each may be used to produce peptide for further use, or these hosts can be used as vehicles for direct application of the peptide to the target pest. Plants can be transformed so as to make the plant toxic to a target pest species which feeds on that plant. Methods for transforming plant cells utilizing, for example agrobacteria, are well known to those skilled in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 Dose response curves of injections of TMOF and its analogs P1 and P4 into ligated abdomens of female A. aegypti. Each point is an average of 3-7 determinations \u00b1S.E.M. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCES SEQ ID NO. 1 is a novel pentapeptide according to the subject invention. SEQ ID NO. 2 is a novel sextapeptide according to the subject invention. SEQ ID NO. 3 is a novel septapeptide according to the subject invention. SEQ ID NO. 4 is a novel octapeptide according to the subject invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject invention concerns novel peptides that inhibit digestion in target pests. Specifically exemplified is the use of the peptides with blood-ingesting insects such as mosquitoes. One embodiment of the subject invention is an octa-peptide, designated P4, which is a fragment of TMOF having two prolines removed from the C-terminus. This removal of two prolines amounts to a truncation of 20% of the TMOF hormone. Despite this substantial truncation, the peptide retains biological activity and has important practical advantages because it is rapidly absorbed and less susceptible to proteolysis. A second peptide of the subject invention is a fragment of only 5 amino acids of the TMOF hormone. This fragment, designated P1, has had 5 prolines removed, compared to TMOF and, thus, is only 50% of the full-length hormone. Surprisingly, as described more fully herein, this small peptide has even greater activity than the octa-peptide P4. The subject invention further encompasses the six and seven amino acid peptides, P2 and P3 (SEQ ID NOS. 2 and 3, respectively), which have 4 and 3 prolines removed, respectively. Also encompassed within the scope of this invention are other obvious modifications of these peptides. The one-letter symbol for the amino acids used herein is well known in the art. For convenience, the relationship of the three-letter abbreviation and the one-letter symbol for amino acids is as follows: ______________________________________Ala A Leu LArg R Lys KAsn N Met MAsp D Phe FCys C Pro PGln Q Ser SGlu E Thr TGly G Trp WHis H Tyr YIle I Val V______________________________________ The novel peptides of the invention can be prepared by well-known synthetic procedures. For example, the peptides can be prepared by the well-known Merrifield solid support method. See Merrifield (1963) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154 and Merrifield (1965) Science 150:178-185. This procedure, though using many of the same chemical reactions and blocking groups of classical peptide synthesis, provides a growing peptide chain anchored by its carboxyl terminus to a solid support, usually cross-linked polystyrene or styrenedivinylbenzene copolymer. This method conveniently simplifies the number of procedural manipulations since removal of the excess reagents at each step is effected simply by washing of the polymer. Alternatively, these peptides can be prepared by use of well-known molecular biology procedures. DNA sequences encoding the peptides of the invention can be synthesized readily because the amino acid sequences are disclosed herein. These DNA sequences are a further aspect of the subject invention. These genes can be used to genetically engineer, for example, bacteria, insect viruses, plant cells, or fungi for synthesis of the peptides of the invention. The insect cell line Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda), deposit number ATCC CRL 1711, is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852 USA. Baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is available from Texas A&amp;M University, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, Tex. 77843, and has been described in Smith, G., M. D. Summers (1978) Virology 89:517-527; and (1979) J. Virology 30:828-838. Other nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (See World Health Organization Technical Report No. 531) such as Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf MNPV), Choristoneura fumiferana (Cf MNPV) (Smith, G., M. D. Summers [1981] J. Virol. 39:125-137), or Spodoptera littoralis (S1 NPV) (Harrap, K. A., C. C. Payne, J. S. Robertson [1977] Virology 79:14-31) can be used instead of Autographa californica NPV. Other insect cell lines can also be substituted for Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9), for example, Trichoplusia ni (Volkman, L. E., M. D. Summers [1975] J. Virol. 16:1630-1637), Spodoptera exigua, Choristoneura fumiferana (Smith, G., M. D. Summers [1981] J. Virol. 39:125-137) and Spodoptera littoralis (Harrap, K. A. et al. [1977] Virology 79:14-31). The various methods employed in the preparation of the plasmids and transformation of host organisms are well known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,909 and 5,130,253. These patents are incorporated herein by reference. These procedures are also described in Maniatis, T., E. F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook (1982) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y. Thus, it is within the skill of those in the genetic engineering art to extract DNA from microbial cells, perform restrictions enzyme digestions, electrophorese DNA fragments, tail and anneal plasmid and insert DNA, ligate DNA, transform cells, e.g., E. coli or plant cells, prepare plasmid DNA, electrophorese proteins, and sequence DNA. Treatment by injection of the compounds of the invention into adult female mosquitos after a blood meal stops egg development, thus rendering the female mosquito sterile and unable to reproduce. Also, using known techniques of molecular biology, mosquito larvae can be fed genetically engineered bacteria producing oostatic hormone and infect other insect larvae with bacteria or viruses containing the oostatic gene, making them unable to digest their food and subsequently starve them to death. A variety of insect viruses, including baculoviruses and entomopoxviruses, are known to those skilled in the art. The production of the claimed peptide compounds by bacteria or virus would be responsible for the starvation activity in larvae and sterilization in adults. This type of treatment of blood-ingesting insect larvae is analogous to the use of bacteria to control insect populations. In applications to the environment of the target pest, the transformant strain can be applied to the natural habitat of the pest. The transformant strain will grow in the pest upon ingestion, while producing the peptide(s) which will have a deleterious effect on proteolytic enzymes biosynthesis and the ova. The organism may be applied by spraying, soaking, injection into the soil, seed coating, seedling coating or spraying, or the like. Where administered in the environment, concentrations of the organism will generally be from 10 6 to 10 10 cells/ml, and the volume applied per hectare will be generally from about 0.1 oz. to 2 lbs or more. Where administered to a plant part inhabited by the target insect, the concentration of the organism will usually be from 10 3 to 10 6 cells/cm 2. In aquatic environments, insect control may be attained below the surface by varying the lipid content of the transformant microorganism strain. It is known that indigenous aquatic algae float due to their lipid content. A variation in lipid content will allow the transformant strain to be distributed at desired depths below the water surface. For commercial formulations, the organisms may be maintained in a nutrient medium which maintains selectivity and results in a low rate of proliferation. Various media may be used, such as yeast extract or L-broth. Once the organism is to be used in the field, the non-proliferating concentrate may be introduced into an appropriate selective nutrient medium, grown to high concentration, generally from about 10 5 to 10 9 cells/ml and may then be employed for introduction into the environment of the blood-ingesting insect. Also, the genetic material of the subject invention, including nucleotide sequences of TMOF and its various analogs, can be used to transform plants, thereby conferring plant resistance to those plants. Materials and methods for transforming plant cells are well known to those skilled in the art. MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptides synthesis. The novel peptides can be synthesized using standard automated solid phase peptide synthesis techniques (Barany, G., R. B. Merrifield [1979] ]In The Peptides, Vol. 2, Gross, E. et al., eds., Academic Press, New York, pp. 1-284), purified on C 18 reversed phase HPLC and sequenced by means of Fourier transform mass spectrometry analysis (Hunt, D. F., J. R. Yates, III, J. Shabanowitz, S. Winston, C. R. Hauer [1986] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:6233-6237). Mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform mass spectrometer operated as previously described (Hunt, D. F., J. Shabanowitz, J. R. Yates, III, N. Z. Zhu, D. H. Russell, M. E. Castro [1987] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:620-623). Samples for mass analysis were prepared by dissolving lyophilized HPLC fractions in 5-20 \u03bcl of 5% acetic acid. A 0.5 to 1.0 \u03bcl aliquot of this solution (5-30 pmol of peptide) was then added to 1 \u03bcl matrix consisting of 1/1 glycerol/monothioglycerol on a gold-plated, stainless-steel probe tip, 2 mm in diameter. Peptides largely in the form of (M+H) + ions were sputtered from this liquid matrix into the gas phase for mass analysis, by bombarding the sample matrix with 6-10 KeV Cs + ion projectiles. The latter were generated from a cesium ion gun (Antek, Palo Alto, Calif.) mounted directly on the spectrometer&#39;s ion source. Methyl ester formation. A standard solution of 2N HCl in methanol was prepared by adding 800 \u03bcl of acetyl chloride dropwise, with stirring, to 5 ml of methanol. After 5 minutes incubation at room temperature, a 100 \u03bcl aliquot of the reagent was added to the lyophilized peptide sample. The sample was esterified for 2 hours at room temperature and the solvent removed by lyophilization. Peptide N-acetylation. The peptide was dissolved in 50/\u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and 50 \u03bcl of freshly prepared acetylation reagent was added to this solution. Acetylation reagent was prepared by adding 100 \u03bcl of acetic arthydride to 300 \u03bcl of dry methanol and lyophilizing the mixture after allowing it to stand 15 minutes. Acetylareal peptide was analyzed directly without further purification. Manual Edman degradation. Manual Edman degradations were performed as previously described (Tarr, G. A. [1977] In Methods in Enzymol, Enzyme Structure, Part E (Hirs, C. H. W., S. N. Timashef, eds.), Vol. 47, pp. 335, 357) and modified for use with mass spectrometry (Hunt et al. [1986], supra). Micromanipulations. The novel peptides were dorsally injected, between the fourth and fifth abdominal segments, an hour after the blood meal by means of finely drawn capillary tube. Female mosquitoes were fed a blood meal and immediately decapitated, their abdomens ligated within an hour with a fine thread to isolate the midgut and ovaries from the brain, thorax, and corpora allata."

  "query": "How does the invention described permit the separation of blood components in a sterile, closed environment?,",
  "negative": "The invention outlines a sophisticated container system designated for handling various substances that require segregation while maintaining a sterile enclosure. The design focuses on a separation process that leverages a first chamber for containing the substance and a second chamber dedicated to holding a solvent or reagent. An external force is applied to both chambers simultaneously, enabling the expulsion of the substance from the first chamber and the solvent from the second one. The expelled mixture then travels through a conduit system with branches that allow for the mixing of the substance with the solvent. Followed by the conduit, a separation unit, which does not necessarily utilize filtration, is tasked with cleansing the substance from any undesired elements. In the preferred application of this design, the separation unit efficiently removes specific impurities that hinder the purity of the substance without necessitating the invasive introduction of external elements, keeping the system intact and sterile throughout the operation. While the described method is notably applicable to a variety of substances, it has particular advantages for processing materials sensitive to contamination and requiring aseptic conditions.\n\n",
  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention generally relates to blood collection and processing systems and methods. In a more particular sense, the invention relates to systems and methods for removing leukocytes from red blood cells prior to transfusion or long term storage. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most of the whole blood collected from donors today is not itself stored and used for transfusion. Instead, the whole blood is separated into its clinically proven components (typically red blood cells, platelets, and plasma), which are themselves individually stored and used to treat a multiplicity of specific conditions and diseased states. For example, the red blood cell component is used to treat anemia; the concentrated platelet component is used to control thrombocytopenic bleeding; and the platelet-poor plasma component is used as a volume expander or as a source of Clotting Factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia. Systems composed of multiple, interconnected plastic bags have met widespread use and acceptance in the collection, processing and storage of these blood components. In the United States, these multiple blood bag systems are subject to regulation by the government. For example, the plastic materials from which the bags and tubing are made must be approved by the government. In addition, the maximum storage periods for the blood components collected in these systems are prescribed by regulation. In the United States, whole blood components collected in a nonsterile, or &#34;open&#34;, system (i.e. one that is open to communication with the atmosphere) must, under governmental regulations, be transfused within twenty-four hours. However, when whole blood components are collected in a sterile, or &#34;closed&#34;, system (i.e., one that is closed to communication with the atmosphere), the red blood cells can be stored up to forty-two days (depending upon the type of anticoagulant and storage medium used); the platelet concentrate can be stored up to five days (depending upon the type of storage container); and the platelet-poor plasma may be frozen and stored for even longer periods. Conventional systems of multiple, interconnected plastic bags have met with widespread acceptance, because these systems can reliably provide the desired sterile, &#34;closed&#34; environment for blood collection and processing, thereby assuring the maximum available storage periods. In collecting whole blood components for transfusion, it is desirable to minimize the presence of impurities or other materials that may cause undesired side effects in the recipient. For example, because of possible febrile reactions, it is generally considered desirable to transfuse red blood cells substantially free of the white blood cell components, particularly for recipients who undergo frequent transfusions. One way to remove white blood cell components is by washing the red blood cells with saline. This technique is time consuming and inefficient, as it can reduce the number of red blood cells available for transfusion. The washing process also exposes the red blood cells to communication with the atmosphere, and thereby constitutes a &#34;non-sterile&#34; entry into the storage system. Once a non-sterile entry is made in a previously closed system, the system is considered &#34;opened&#34;, and transfusion must occur within twenty-four hours, regardless of the manner in which the blood was collected and processed in the first place. In the United States, an entry into a blood collection system that presents the probability of non-sterility that exceeds one in a million is generally considered to constitute a &#34;non-sterile&#34; entry. Another way to remove white blood cell components is by filtration. Systems and methods for accomplishing this within the context of conventional multiple blood bag configurations are described in Wisdom U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,596,657 and 4,767,541, as well as in Carmen et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,810,378 and 4,855,063. In these arrangements, an in line leukocyte filtration device is used. The filtration can thereby be accomplished in a closed system. However, the filtration processes associated with these arrangements require the extra step of wetting the filtration device before use with a red blood cell additive solution or the like. This added step complicates the filtration process and increases the processing time. Other systems and methods for removing white blood cell components in the context of closed, multiple blood bag configurations are described in Stewart U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,577 and Stewart et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,048. In these filtration systems and methods, a transfer assembly dedicated solely to the removal of leukocytes from red blood cells is used. The transfer assembly also has a second fluid path that bypasses the separation device for the purpose of transporting liquid and air around the separation device. A need still exists for further improved systems and methods for removing undesired matter from blood components prior to transfusion or storage in a way that lends itself to use in closed multiple blood bag system environments. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a multiple container blood collection system for conveniently processing the various components of blood. The systems and methods that embody the features of the invention are particularly well suited for use in association with closed blood collection systems and conventional sterile connection techniques, thereby permitting separation to occur in a sterile, closed environment. One aspect of the invention provides a blood processing system and associated method that include a first variable volume chamber to hold blood and a second variable volume chamber to hold additive solution for blood. The system and method further employ a separation device to remove undesired material from blood. According to this aspect of the invention, an actuated element exerts external force simultaneously upon both first and second variable volume chambers. The force simultaneously expels a first flow of blood from the first variable volume chamber and a second flow of additive solution from the second variable volume chamber. The system and method that incorporate this aspect of the invention also include a fluid flow system to convey fluid flow in response to the external force exerted by the actuated element and without the application of any additional external pumping force. The fluid flow system includes a first branch communicating with the first variable volume chamber to convey the first flow of blood, a second branch communicating with the second variable volume chamber to convey the second flow of additive solution simultaneously with and independent of the first flow, and a third branch communicating with the first and second branches to mix outside the first and second variable volume chambers the blood in the first branch with the additive solution in the second branch to create a mixed flow comprising blood and additive solution. The third branch further communicates with the filter to direct the mixed flow of blood and additive solution through the filter to remove undesired matter from the blood. In a preferred embodiment, the third branch also communicates with a transfer chamber to direct the mixed flow of blood and additive solution from the filter into the transfer chamber. In one embodiment, the first and second variable volume chambers comprise, respectively, a first flexible container and a separate second flexible container. In an alternative embodiment, the first and second variable volume chambers comprise compartments within a single flexible container. While the systems and methods that embody the features of the invention can be used to process all types of blood components, they are well suited for the removal of white blood cell components from red blood cells by filtration prior to transfusion or long term storage. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the separation device removes leukocytes by filtration. According to another aspect of the invention, the first variable volume chamber includes spaced apart first and second ports. According to this aspect of the invention, as the actuated element exerts external force simultaneously upon both first and second variable volume chambers, the force simultaneously expels the first flow of red blood cells from the first port of the first variable volume chamber, the second flow of additive solution for the red blood cells from the second variable volume chamber, as well as a third flow of plasma constituent from the second port of the first variable volume chamber. This arrangement can be used to keep a substantial population of leukocytes contained within the first variable volume chamber, resulting in both red blood cells and plasma constituent that are depleted of leukocytes. The separation device further enhances the removal of additional leukocytes from the red blood cells by filtration, while simultaneously mixing the red blood cell flow with the second flow of additive solution. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon review of the following description, drawings, and appended claims.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A blood collection assembly 10 is shown in FIG. 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the assembly 10 serves to separate and store the red blood cells as well as the plasma and platelet blood components by conventional centrifugation techniques. The assembly 10 also serves to simultaneously mix additive solution to and remove undesired matter from the red blood cells before storage. In the illustrated embodiment, the undesired matter comprises leukocytes, which are removed by filtration. As used herein, the term &#34;filtration&#34; is intended to include separation achieved by various centrifugal and non-centrifugal techniques, and not merely &#34;filtration&#34; in the technical sense. Separation can occur by absorption, columns, chemical, electrical, and electromagnetic means. The term &#34;filtration&#34; is thus broadly used in this specification to encompass all of these separation techniques as well. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the assembly 10 includes a primary bag or container 12, an auxiliary bag or container 16 containing an additive solution S, and two transfer bags or containers 14 and 18. The primary bag 12 includes an integrally attached donor tube 22 that carries a phlebotomy needle 24. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment, the primary bag 12 has a top and bottom port configuration like that described and claimed in Johansson et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,178. A commercial embodiment of such a system is sold by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Fenwal Division) under tradename OPTI-SYSTEM. It should be appreciated that, alternatively, all the ports associated with the primary bag can be arranged along the top of the bag, as is also conventional for blood bags. Branched tubing 20 integrally attaches the primary bag 12 to the bags 14, 16, and 18. The tubing 20 is divided into tube branches 20A; 20B; 20C; and 20D. In the particular configuration shown in FIG. 1, the bag 12 includes two bottom ports 34 and 36 and a top port 38. The donor tube 22 communicates with the bottom port 36 for conveying whole blood from a donor into the primary bag 12. The primary bag 12 contains a suitable anticoagulant A for this reason. The branch tube 20A communicates with the bottom port 34. The branch tube 20A joins the branch tube 20C through a conventional &#34;Y&#34; or &#34;T&#34; connector 32. The branch tubes 20A and 20C serve together to convey fluid from the bottom region of the bag 12 into the transfer bag 18. In use, the transfer bag 18 is intended to receive the red blood cell component of the whole blood collected in the primary bag 12. The transfer bag 18 ultimately serves as the storage container for the red blood cell component. The branch tube 20D communicates with the top port 38 of the bag 12, which serves to convey fluid from the top region of the bag 12 into the transfer bag 14. In use, the transfer bag 14 is intended to receive the plasma blood component of the whole blood collected in the primary bag 12 through branch tube 20D. The transfer bag 14 ultimately serves as the storage container for the plasma blood component. Depending upon the particular objectives of the blood processing procedure, the plasma component can carry substantially all the platelets associated with the collected whole blood, in which case the component would be called &#34;platelet-rich plasma&#34; or PRP. Alternatively, the plasma component can be substantially free of platelets, in which case the component would be called &#34;platelet-poor plasma&#34; or PPP. The branch tube 20B communicates through a bottom port 48 with the additive solution bag 16. The branch tube 20B thereby serves to convey additive solution from the bag 16. In the illustrated embodiment, the transfer bag 16 contains a storage solution S for the red blood cell (RBC) component of the whole blood collected in the primary bag 12. One such solution is disclosed in Grode et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,269. Another such solution is conventionally called &#34;SAG-M&#34; solution. The connector 32 joins branch tubes 20A, 20B, and 20C. The branch tube 20C thereby also serves to mix RBC from bag 12 with additive solution from bag 16 during conveyance into the transfer bag 18. The branch tube 20C further includes an in line filter 40 for separating leukocytes from RBC-additive solution mixture being conveyed into the transfer bag 18. In use, the transfer bag 18 receives the RBC component mixed with the storage solution S after passage through the filter 40. In this arrangement, the filter 40 contains a conventional fibrous filtration medium 42 suited for the removal of leukocytes from red blood cells. The filtration medium 42 can include cotton wool, cellulose acetate or another synthetic fiber like polyester. It should be appreciated that the filter 40 can be used to remove other types of undesired materials from the RBC component, depending upon its particular construction. In the illustrated embodiment, the assembly 10 includes in line fluid flow control devices 26; 28; and 30 in the tube branches 20A; 20B; and 20D, respectively. In the illustrated arrangement, the flow control devices 26; 28; and 30 take the form of conventional frangible cannulas. Each cannula normally blocks fluid flow through its associated tube branch. When manually bent, the cannula breaks apart to open the associated tube branch. In the illustrated embodiment, the cannula 26 controls fluid flow through the branch tube 20A. The cannula 28 controls fluid flow through the branch tube 20B. The cannula 30 controls fluid flow through the branch tube 20D. In the illustrated embodiment, the transfer bags 14 and 18 include normally sealed administration ports 44. The ports 44 are enclosed within conventional tear-away flaps. When opened, the flaps expose the ports 44 for attachment to conventional transfusion or transfer tubing (not shown). In the illustrated embodiment, the transfer bag 18 also includes a length of transfusion tubing 46 integrally connected to it, along with an in line cannula 47. The bags and tubing associated with the processing assembly 10 can be made from conventional approved medical grade plastic materials, such as polyvinyl chloride plasticized with di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP). The assembly 10 shown in FIG. 1, once sterilized, constitutes a sterile, &#34;closed&#34; system, as judged by the applicable standards in the United States. The assembly 10 remains &#34;closed&#34; during processing. This assures that the longest authorized storage intervals can be used for the components collected. It should be appreciated that, alternatively, the assembly 10 can initially comprise a group of sterile subassemblies. For example, the primary bag 12 could comprise one sterile subassembly, the transfer bag 14 another sterile subassembly, the transfer bag 18 and filter 40 yet another sterile subassembly, and the additive solution bag 16 still another sterile subassembly. In this arrangement (not shown), the branch tubes 20A, 20B, 20C, and 20D would carry mating sterile connection devices that the user connects together at time of use, thereby creating the single integral assembly 10 shown in the drawings. Sterile connection devices that could be used for this purpose are shown in Granzow et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,157,723 and 4,265,280. In another alternative arrangement, sterile subassemblies can be assembled together by other means and then undergo terminal sterilization after assembled. In use, the primary bag 12 receives whole blood from a donor through the donor tubing 22. Afterward, the donor tubing 22 is preferably sealed and disconnected from the primary bag 12 using conventional techniques. The whole blood then undergoes separation by centrifugation within the primary bag 12. During this processing step (as FIG. 2 shows), the system 10 is placed as an integral assembly into a bucket 50 of a conventional blood centrifuge. The filter 40 remains integrally attached to the assembly 10 during the centrifugation process. As FIG. 2 shows, during centrifugation, the filter 40 occupies the blood centrifuge bucket 50 alongside the bags 12; 14; 16; and 18, which nest in succession one against the other. In this arrangement, the filter 40 is sandwiched within the bucket 50 next to the primary bag 18."

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of any portion of the patent document, as it appears in any patent granted from the present application or in the Patent and Trademark Office file or records available to the public, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. A microfiche appendix containing source code utilized in practicing an exemplary embodiment of the invention is included as part of the Specification and is hereinafter referred to as Appendix A. Appendix A includes a total of 2 microfiche and a total of 151 frames. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates in general to the field of neurology and neurological testing. More particularly, the present invention relates to the objective clinical assessment of motor function by computer analysis of a digitized writing sample, as may be used in the diagnosis and monitoring of motor disorders as well as the evaluation of motor development and handedness in children. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A patient may seek medical treatment for a variety of complaints which suggest a disturbance of motor function, such as weakness, stiffness, tremor, clumsiness, or difficulty in executing movements. It then is the physician&#39;s responsibility to correctly diagnose the patient, and to implement the appropriate course of treatment. A number of syndromes which involve motor dysfunction exist, and are defined by their clinical manifestations. For example, Parkinson&#39;s Disease, which results from a degeneration of cells in the basal ganglia of the brain, is associated with slowness of movement (\u201cbradykinesia\u201d), muscle rigidity, and a tremor often said to have a \u201cpill rolling\u201d quality which occurs at rest but tends to diminish with voluntary movements. In addition, patients suffering from Parkinson&#39;s Disease may exhibit a loss of facial expression, a difficulty in initiating movements, and a diminution of their handwriting (\u201cmicrographia\u201d). Another fairly common motor disorder is essential tremor, an inherited condition which can present in childhood but more typically appears later in adult life. It usually involves the upper limbs, but may also affect the head, jaw, lips, tongue and pharynx. This tremor may abate upon ingestion of alcohol or beta-adrenergic antagonists. It may interfere with voluntary movements to the point where a sufferer is unable to drink from a glass or raise a spoon without spilling its contents. There are numerous other motor disorders from hyperkinetic conditions such as essential tremor mentioned above to complex akinetic-rigid and other degenerative syndromes. Motor disorders may be considered primary when there are no known causes (other than genetics) and secondary, or symptomatic, when a known etiologic agent exists. Examples of primary motor disorders include Parkinson&#39;s disease, essential tremor and adult onset focal dystonia such as writer&#39;s cramp. Secondary motor disorders are more numerous and include Parkinsonian syndromes, side effects of medications such as tardive dyskinesia from neuroleptic use, immune, ischemic or even traumatic causes. The multitude of motor disorders share many overlapping symptoms and signs. Even though sophisticated rating systems have been developed for some disorders (e.g., Parkinson&#39;s Disease) to aid in the accuracy of diagnosis, in the hands of inexperienced practitioners, or where the disease is in its early stages and clinical signs are subtle, the potential for an erroneous diagnosis is substantial. Diagnosis by a traditional neurologic exam may also be difficult where the patient is unable to comply with fairly detailed instructions for tests used to evaluate motor function. As an example, a young child or a demented adult suspected of having a defect in motor development may be difficult to evaluate. If an error in diagnosis is made, there may be significant adverse consequences. For example, the appropriate therapies for Parkinson&#39;s Disease and essential tremor are very different, in that patients with Parkinson&#39;s Disease are treated with agents that increase or facilitate dopamine activity whereas patients with essential tremor are treated with agents that block beta-adrenergic neurotransmitters. Not only would misdiagnosis result in a lack of a clinical benefit, but administering the inappropriate drug could have undesirable or even toxic side effects. For example, beta adrenergenic blocking agents can adversely affect cardiac or pulmonary functions; unnecessary use in a Parkinson&#39;s Disease patient, particularly an older patient, could be dangerous. Similarly, use of agents that treat Parkinson&#39;s disease in a patient without that condition could have harmful consequences. Specific examples of Parkinson&#39;s Disease treating agents include artane, sinemet and baclofen. Artane, an anticholinergic agent used to treat Parkinsonian tremors and dystonia can severely affect cognition, cardiac, visual and urinary function. Sinemet, a mainstay drug for Parkinson&#39;s disease, causes nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and low blood pressure. Baclofen, an anti-spasmodic agent, and clonazepam, an anxiolytic and muscle relaxant, are used in many motor disorders but can alter mental status, blood pressure and can even be fatal when used inappropriately. Further, even where the correct diagnosis has been made, it is important to be able to evaluate the clinical progress of a patient. Often the methods for measuring progress are extremely subjective. One means by which clinicians have attempted to decrease subjectivity in diagnosis and monitoring motor function has been through the use of standardized clinical tests. Examples of such tests include asking the patient to touch his finger to, alternately, his nose and the outstretched finger of the examiner, or to run her heel up and down her shin, or to touch his or her thumb to, in succession, each of the other fingertips of the same hand. Drawing has been used to evaluate motor function for many years. The famous neuropsychiatrist Kraepelin, at the beginning of this century, adapted an instrument to quantitatively analyze signatures for the evaluation of motor function in schizophrenic patients (Blyler et al., 1997, Schizophrenia Res. 26: 15-23, citing Hoch, 1904, Psychol. Bull. 1:241-257). One common test involves asking the patient to draw an Archimedes spiral. A thorough discussion of the spiral drawing test may be found in Bain &amp; Findley, in \u201cStandards in Neurology, Series A: Assessment, diagnosis and evaluation, Book I: Assessing Tremor Severity,\u201d published by Smith Gordon and Co., Ltd., London, England/Nishimura Co., Ltd., Niigata-Shi, Japan, copies of which can be obtained in the United States through Books International Inc., Herndon, Virginia. According to that reference, the severity of tremor apparent in the spiral is rated from 0-10, where critical factors in determining the grade of a particular spiral are the degree of perpendicular displacement of the track from the intended trajectory and the extent to which tremor persists during each turn (Bain &amp; Findley, p.9). Tremor is said to become more apparent in the outward turns of the spiral. An example of a study which used spiral analysis to quantify the effects of the drug terguride in Parkinson&#39;s Disease patients is reported in Filipova et al., 1988, Eur. Arch. Psychiatr. Neurol. Sci.237:298-303. Another study which used spiral copying ability to evaluate the effect of the drug ondasetron on cerebellar tremor is described in Rice et al., 1997, J. Neurol. Neurosur. &amp; Psychiat. 62:282-284. A number of investigators have attempted to lessen the subjectivity of evaluation by using computer assistance. For example, Elble et al. (1996, Movement Disorders 11:70-78) asked patients with essential tremor to write a series of cursive e&#39;s and l&#39;s and, in some cases, to draw an Archimedes spiral on a digitizing tablet. They reported detecting changes in mean acceleration amplitude and tremor frequency with an accuracy which indicated that use of such a tablet was an accurate and less-costly alternative to accelerometry for tremor evaluation. Wissel et al. (1996, J. Neurol. Neurosurg. &amp; Psychiat. 61:172-175) used a digitizing tablet to measure writing speed in an evaluation of the effectiveness of botulinum toxin for treating writer&#39;s cramp. Eichorn et al., 1996, (Movement Disorders 11:289-297) used a computational analysis of open loop handwriting movements, as captured by a digitizing tablet, to monitor the effect of apomorphine on patients with early untreated Parkinson&#39;s Disease. They reported that computer-assisted analysis of automated handwriting movements can be a quick method for quantifying dopamimetic effects on handwriting movements in parkinsonian patients. However, they also found that there was no statistically significant correlation when changes in the individual handwriting parameters were correlated with a subscore obtained using the Unified Parkinson&#39;s Disease Rating Scale (\u201cUPDRS\u201d; Lang and Fahn, 1989, in \u201cQuantification of neurologic deficit,\u201d Munsat, ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Storeham, Mass., pp. 285-309) for the writing hand, an observation which they indicated was expected, as the LPDRS assesses different kinds of parkinsonian symptoms, such as rigidity, akinesia, and tremor. Blyler et al. (1997, Schizophrenia Res. 26: 15-23) used line drawing to measure lateralized motor performance in schizophrenic patients. The patients drew lines on a piece of paper, which were then scanned into a computer and a regression was run on the points of the line and used to calculate the deviation from straightness. The results were found to correlate with clinical rating scales of motor function, including the Simpson\u2014Argus Rating Scale (Simpson and Argus, 1970, Acta Psychiatr. Scand. 212 (Suppl.), 9-11) for parkinsonian symptoms. Slavin et al., 1999, J. Internatl. Neuropsychol. Soc. 5:20-25, used a digitizing tablet to analyze writing samples from patients with dementia of Alzheimer&#39;s type (\u201cDAT\u201d). Kinematic measures of stroke length, duration, and peak velocity were expressed in terms of consistency via a signal-to-noise ratio. Patterns typical of DAT but not Parkinson&#39;s disease were observed. Lange-K\u00fcttner (1998, Perceptual and Motor Skills 86:1299-1310) report that speeded drawing of basic graphic patterns by young children, as captured on a digitizing tablet, could be used to identify psychophysical problems. Computational analysis of handwriting, for identification or analytical purposes, is described in Singer and Tishby, 1994, Biol. Cybern. 71: 227-237; van den Heuvel et al., 1998, Acta Psychologica 100: 145-159; and Morasso and Sanguineti, 1993, Acta Psychologica 82: 213-235. In recent years the inventor has reported the use of a digitizing tablet and computer analysis of written spirals to evaluate motor disorders such as Parkinson&#39;s Disease and essential tremor (Pullman et al., 1995, Neurology 45 (Suppl 4):A218 (abstract 208S); Yu et al., 1997, Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 23:abstract 737.8; Yu et al., 1998, Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 24:abstract 672.2). During this period of time, the inventor has been developing a method of producing a clinical rating which, unlike Eichorn&#39;s measurements, correlates with the UPDRS score based on the computer analysis of handwritten spirals. This method is not described in any of the foregoing disclosures, but is disclosed herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The aforedescribed limitations and inadequacies of conventional systems and methods for analyzing movement disorders are substantially overcome by the present invention, in which a primary object is to provide a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive computerized system and method for clinically assessing motor function. Such a system and method can be adapted for analyzing movement disorders such as Parkinson&#39;s disease, essential tremor and dystonia, and for characterizing neurological development and handedness in children. In particular, the present invention relates to a computerized system and method for clinically assessing motor function comprising correlating geometric indices, computed from digital information obtained from a geometric shape drawn by a subject to be evaluated, with a clinical rating score derived using a \u201cstandard of reference\u201d generated by one or more clinical expert. By analogy to a biochemical assay, which measures the amount of reactant by comparison to a standard curve, the present invention provides a method and system by which a medical practitioner can evaluate the motor function of a subject by generating a digitized writing sample and computationally comparing geometric indices obtained therefrom with values associated with clinical ratings assigned by skilled neurologists. Interpretation is thereby rendered more objective and consistent. Furthermore, the test may be administered and interpreted by physicians who are not skilled or experienced in evaluating motor disorders, for example general practitioners or pediatricians who are not specialized in the practice of neurology. The present invention therefore provides a means for evaluating persons early in the course of disease, and for screening patients for motor dysfunction or, in the case of children, disorders of motor development. Hence, in accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a system for clinically assessing motor function in a subject is provided that includes: an electronic digitizing tablet having a writing device for obtaining a geometric pattern handwritten by the subject and providing one or more digital signals representing the pattern; and a microprocessor for processing the signals to derive one or more geometric indices representative of motor function and for computing from the indices, using the aforementioned expert-generated \u201cstandard of reference\u201d, a clinical rating score indicative of motor function of the subject. In another aspect of the present invention, a preferred method for analyzing movement disorders includes: a method for clinically assessing motor function in a subject comprising: obtaining a geometric pattern handwritten by the subject on a digitizing tablet; generating one or more digital signals representing the geometric pattern; processing the signals to derive one or more geometric indices representative of motor function; and computing from the geometric indices, using the aforementioned expert-generated \u201cstandard of reference\u201d, a clinical rating score indicative of motor function of the subject. Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures showing illustrative embodiments of the invention.

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/706,926, filed on Sep. 28, 2012. The entirety of that disclosure is hereby fully incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND [0002] The present disclosure relates to a pointing device worn on the head of a user. It finds particular application in conjunction with training for surgical education, and will be described with particular reference thereto, although it can be used for many other purposes such as teaching of combined skills where hands-free pointing, spotting, indicating, or directing is useful. [0003] Part of the training process to become a board eligible surgeon involves completion of a residency program. In the residency program, the resident doctor will perform surgical procedures on a consenting patient under the supervision of a trainer surgeon. [0004] When taking a surgical resident through a procedure, the trainer&#39;s hands are often busy performing the steps of the operation, and instructions and directions must be given verbally. This is true for both laparoscopic and open procedures. In addition, the surgical resident is usually participating in the procedure as well, wielding surgical instruments such as a scalpel or other cutting or suturing implements. It would be helpful for the trainer to have a pointing device that can be worn and used to accurately direct the trainee where to focus and dissect, suture, cauterize, etc., in the patient. BRIEF DESCRIPTION [0005] The present disclosure relates to a pointing device that can be worn on a user&#39;s head, such as the head of a trainer teaching surgical procedures. The pointing device includes a laser pointer that provides a dot or beam of light at a location dictated by the user, such as to certain tissue to be excised from a patient. An user-operated pneumatically controlled switch is provided so that the dot/beam can be toggled on or off by the user without manual intervention. The switch can be controlled by the users breath. The pointing device also includes a band/strap assembly for forming a head harness for mounting the laser pointer and switching mechanism to the head of the user. By moving the user&#39;s head and by activating the switch to engage the laser pointer, the user can point to a given target, such as tissue to be excised from a patient, during a surgical procedure. [0006] Disclosed in embodiments herein is an adjustable head-mounted pointing device that comprises a circumferential headband; a cross strap extending between opposite sides of the circumferential headband; a laser pointer mounted on one side of the circumferential headband; a battery pack; and a pneumatically controlled switch for activating the laser pointer. The laser pointer is an electronic device that converts input power into a narrow beam of coherent light that is used to disclose a targeted area by the user upon activation. [0007] The battery pack can be mounted at the center of the cross strap. Alternatively, the battery pack can be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband opposite the laser pointer. In other embodiments, the battery pack can be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband behind the laser pointer. [0008] The laser pointer may emit a red or green colored light beam. Other color or color combinations are also contemplated, as well as dual colors or multiple color combination lasers. For example, the color green may be used by the trainer to indicate to proceed forward, red to halt, etc. [0009] An adjustment device or dial may be present on a rear side of the circumferential headband for controlling the circumference of the headband. [0010] The pointing device may sometimes further comprise a mount on a front side of the circumferential headband, the mount having an arm and a grip. Other times, the pointing device further comprises at least one longitudinally-oriented catch on the cross strap. The pointing device could further comprise at least one vertically-oriented catch on the circumferential headband. [0011] The laser pointer may include a base and a muzzle. The pneumatically controlled switch may include a means for conveying pneumatic pressure, such as a straw connected to a pressure transducer. [0012] Also described in embodiments is a head-mounted pointing device that comprises a frame formed from a circumferential headband and a cross strap that extends between opposite sides of the circumferential headband; a battery pack mounted at the center of the cross strap; a laser pointer mounted on one side of the circumferential headband, the laser pointer having a base and a muzzle; a pneumatically controlled switch for controlling the laser pointer, the switch including a flexible straw extending from the base of the laser pointer; means for changing the size of the circumferential headband; means for changing the size of the cross strap; and a mount on a front side of the circumferential headband, the mount having an arm and a grip. [0013] Methods of using a head-mounted pointing device to point to a given target during a surgical procedure are also disclosed. The head-mounted pointing device is donned by the user, such as the surgical trainer. The laser pointer of the pointing device is engaged or toggled on by breathing (e.g. puffing) at a pneumatically controlled switch to activate a laser beam. The laser beam is then pointed at the given target. [0014] The laser pointer of the pointing device can be disengaged or the toggled off by breathing (e.g. sipping or sucking) at the pneumatically controlled switch to deactivate the laser beam. [0015] The pneumatically controlled switch sometimes uses a binary control. Other times, the pneumatically controlled switch uses sip-and-puff control. [0016] The method may use any of the various embodiments of a head-mounted pointing device described herein. [0017] These and other non-limiting characteristics of the disclosure are more particularly disclosed below. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0018] The following is a brief description of the drawings, which are presented for the purposes of illustrating the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein and not for the purposes of limiting the same. [0019] FIG. 1 is a side perspective view of a prototype of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. [0020] FIG. 2 is a top view of the prototype of FIG. 1. [0021] FIG. 3 is a front view of the prototype of FIG. 1. [0022] FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram or schematic illustrating the control of the laser pointer. [0023] FIG. 5 is an illustration of another embodiment of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. [0024] FIG. 6 depicts the head-mounted pointing device of FIG. 5 on the head of the user. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0025] A more complete understanding of the compositions and methods disclosed herein can be obtained by reference to the accompanying drawings. These figures are merely schematic representations based on convenience and the ease of demonstrating the present disclosure, and are, therefore, not intended to define or limit the scope of the exemplary embodiments. [0026] Although specific terms are used in the following description for the sake of clarity, these terms are intended to refer only to the particular structure of the embodiments selected for illustration in the drawings, and are not intended to define or limit the scope of the disclosure. In the drawings and the following description below, it is to be understood that like numeric designations refer to components of like function. [0027] The present disclosure relates to a pointing or spotting device that can be worn on the head of the user. As previously noted, such a pointing device can be useful for a trainer surgeon/trainer of surgical procedures who is working with a surgical resident or trainee. Teaching in the operating room is particularly difficult in laparoscopic cases, because it is difficult to demonstrate on the laparoscopic instrument screen where the trainee should direct their attention or where they should operate, when the trainer&#39;s hands are busy. The pointing device can be used to visually indicate a particular location to the surgical resident instead of through spoken words. [0028] However, the pointing device cannot simply be an always-on device. For example, the trainer may wish to indicate a location where the surgical resident should dissect (i.e. cut). However, with an always-on device, the surgical resident may continue dissecting at the indicated location when the trainer wishes dissection to stop. A switch is required to deactivate the pointing device. However, the hands of the trainer surgeon are sterile, and the feet of the trainer surgeon may be operating other instruments. Thus, a different switching mechanism must be used. [0029] FIG. 1 is a right side perspective view of a prototype of the head-mounted pointing device of the present disclosure. FIG. 2 is a top view of the prototype device. FIG. 3 is a front view of the prototype device. This device may also be considered to be a laser headlight, or a hands-free device, or a head-mounted laser pointer, or headgear with a mounted pointing device. [0030] The head-mounted pointing device 100 includes a frame formed from a circumferential headband 110 and a cross strap 120. The circumferential headband extends around the wearer&#39;s head, and has an interior surface 112 and an exterior surface 114 (see FIG. 2 for a better view of these two surfaces). The cross strap 120 extends between opposite sides (usually the left side 102 and the right side 104 ) of the circumferential headband, and passes over the wearer&#39;s head. It is contemplated that the cross strap passes between the ears of the user, for comfort. The cross strap 120 also has an interior surface 122 and an exterior surface 124 (see FIG. 3 for a better view of these two surfaces). The cross strap may be described as a half circle, and the circumferential headband may be described as a full circle. The frame can be made in several different ways. The size of the circumferential headband can be adjusted; for example, as illustrated here, a dial 116 is present on the rear side 108 of the circumferential headband to control its circumference. Similarly, the size of the cross strap can also be adjusted. These allow the frame to be fitted to the head of the user and worn comfortably. The frame can be made of any suitable material. For example, the frame can be made of plastic, cloth, etc. here, a padding 118 is present on the front side 106 of the circumferential headband. The circumferential headband on the cross strap may be made as one integral piece, or may be made as separate components that are later joined together. [0031] It is contemplated that additional attachment means may be present on the frame for holding other tools or equipment. For example, also visible on the front side 106 of the frame is a mount 130 that extends outwardly from the exterior surface 114 of the circumferential headband. The mount includes an arm 134 and a grip 132 at the end of the arm. The arm is adjustable at both ends 136 , 138 for positioning the grip as desired. It is contemplated that, for example an illumination light can be held by the grip to provide illumination to the user. This light (not shown) is usually oriented in a different direction from that of the laser pointer. As another example, a longitudinally-oriented molded catch 129 is also present on either side of the cross strap 120 , and can be used to hold additional items as desired by the user. As yet another example, also visible in FIG. 2 are two vertically oriented molded catches 119 located on the rear side 108 of the circumferential headband. However, it should be clear that embodiments are contemplated in which these additional attachment means are not present. [0032] A laser pointer 140 is mounted to one side of the circumferential headband. As illustrated here, the laser pointer is mounted on the right side 104 of the frame, where the cross strap 120 connects to the headband 110. The laser pointer 140 is mounted to one side of the circumferential headband, i.e. on the left side 102 or right side 104 of the user&#39;s head, rather than directly in front (i.e. on the user&#39;s forehead). The laser pointer typically emits a red or green color, which provides for visual distinction against the background. The power of the laser pointer is very low, usually 5 miiliwatts (mW) or less. The laser pointer can be mounted to the circumferential headband using generally known means such as hook-and-loop fasteners, adhesive, etc. As illustrated here, the laser pointer 140 includes a base 142 and a muzzle 144. The muzzle points in the direction in which the laser light will be emitted, towards the front of the frame. [0033] A battery pack 150 is included to provide power to the laser pointer. A wire 152 connects the battery pack 150 to the laser pointer 140. As illustrated here, the battery pack is placed at the center 125 of the cross strap, i.e. on top of the user&#39;s head, for balance. However, it is possible for the battery pack to be mounted anywhere on the headband 110 or the cross strap 120. For example, the battery pack could be mounted on the side of the circumferential headband opposite the laser pointer. Alternatively, the battery pack could be attached to the circumferential headband behind the laser pointer 140. Desirably, the battery pack is placed to minimize neck strain. The battery pack contains standard batteries, e.g. AA, AAA. C, D, 9-volt, button/coin cells, etc. [0034] A pneumatically controlled switch 160 is used to turn the laser pointer 141 on or off. The switch includes a pressure transducer (not visible) and a straw 162 which extends from the laser pointer down towards and off to one side of the users mouth. The straw is detachable (for replacement as needed) and flexible (for customization to the user). A mouthpiece 164 is located at the free end of the straw. As illustrated here, the pressure transducer is located within the base of the laser pointer, and the straw 162 and mouthpiece 164 are visible. [0035] It is contemplated that the laser pointer can be activated or controlled by blowing into the straw to toggle the laser pointer on and off. This can be done using a binary control, where the on/off state of the laser pointer is stored and switched with each breath registered by the switch. Alternatively, a \u201csip-and-puff\u201d style of control may be used. For example, a higher-than-normal atmospheric air pressure can be produced by puffing and blowing into the straw, and this higher air pressure could be used to turn on the laser pointer. A lower-than-normal atmospheric air pressure can be produced by sipping or sucking against the straw, and this lower air pressure could be used to turn off the laser pointer. This pneumatically controlled switch may also be referred to as a blow switch. The pneumatically controlled switch operates by detecting a change in pressure exerted by the users breathing. [0036] In other embodiments, it is also contemplated that the laser pointer is able to produce multiple colors, or that two or more laser pointers emitting different colors are placed on the head-mounted pointing device. To control the different laser pointers, additional pneumatically controlled switches may be present as well. For example, in one variation, a red laser pointer is mounted on the right side of the frame, and a green laser pointer is mounted on the left side of the frame. Two pneumatically controlled switches are provided, one on each side of the users head. Each switch would control a separate laser pointer. For example, the red laser pointer could be controlled by blowing to the right, and the green laser pointer could be controlled by blowing to the left. This type of control would permit both a red dot and a green dot to be on the target simultaneously. If desired, the red laser pointer and the green laser pointer could be placed on the same side of the frame, as long as the pneumatically controlled switches are located on opposite sides of the frame. Alternatively, a multicolor laser pointer could be mounted on the frame along with two pneumatically controlled switches. One switch would toggle the laser pointer on and off, and the other switch would control which color was being generated by the laser pointer. [0037] FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram showing the control of the laser pointer via the pneumatically controlled switch. Beginning at the left side, Switch 1 is an on/off switch that determines whether the laser pointer can be activated at all. This on/off switch may be located on the laser pointer or on the battery pack, and is usually electromechanical in nature. Switch 2 is the pneumatically controlled switch. The pneumatically controlled switch operates by sensing the difference in pressure between a high port and a low port, and operates based on the time period for which a differential pressure above a specified threshold level is applied. The threshold level can be adjusted by changing the leftmost capacitor in the diagram. A data or delay (D) flip-flop circuit is used to control the laser emission. When Switch 1 is closed, the laser pointer is in the ON state, or in other words is able to receive user input and be toggled on/off. Switch 2 provides the toggle function. Initially, blowing into the blow switch closes Switch 2 and turns the laser on to emit the laser beam. After the pressure is removed, Switch 2 is opened, and the laser beam is emitted until Switch 2 is closed again. Put another way, Switch 1 controls whether the laser pointer device is ON or OFF. Switch 2 changes the state of the laser beam (from ON to OFF, or from OFF to ON). An inverting Schmitt trigger is used to add hysteresis and prevent unwanted rapid switching of the laser emission/debounce the circuit. The input voltage to the circuit must fall below a threshold value before the laser pointer is toggled on/off."

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to adaptations or augmentations of waterproof covers for electronic devices. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With continued advances in technology, today&#39;s consumers find themselves with an ever-increasing number of personal digital devices to choose from. These include cellular phones, \u201csmart\u201d phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable global positioning system (GPS) units, compact game systems, compact audio/video players and wireless reading devices for e-books. While these personal digital devices continue to improve, with an ever-increasing list of features, they still suffer from a long-standing problem: their vulnerability to the elements, in particular dust and water. They are also susceptible to damage from general wear and tear, most noticeably scratching or other adverse impacts on the video screens. Protective covers have therefore been developed in order to protect these personal digital devices and the design of such covers must adapt to the available features of the personal digital devices. U.S. Pat. No. 8,564,950 to Rayner discloses a housing for covering at least part of a mobile computing device having a touch screen display and a motion-actuated switch. The housing of Rayner includes a clasping mechanism configured such that when top and bottom members of the housing are coupled together a liquid-proof seal is provided. The clasping mechanism of Rayner in some embodiments includes a coin slot feature. The housing of Rayner includes a waterproof gasket that is permissive to sound but not to liquid. The housing of Rayner includes an encasement that enables operation of the touch screen display and covers the switch. The apparatus of Rayner further includes a switch mechanism that includes a switch actuator protruding from an outer surface of the encasement and covered by a flexible seal attached to the encasement. However, the clasping mechanism of Rayner and its coin slot feature renders the housing of Rayner cumbersome for some users. Objects of embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the description that follows. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a cover for an electronic device, whereby a protective membrane is incorporated to a sealing mount or frame. The protective membrane with sealing mount connectively seals into a soft plastic shell that over-molds a hard, translucent frame with reciprocal compression seals to complete a waterproof enclosure. The over-molded soft, elastomeric shell fully encompasses the outer perimeter of the hard translucent shell, providing shock absorbency. The cover includes a sound-isolation chamber and sound isolating, acoustic membranes extending across the cover&#39;s speaker and microphone apertures. The case design improves the sound pressure or timbre within the cover, by isolating and maximizing the transmission of sound from the speakers or into the microphones effectively eliminating all echoes. An acoustic chamber captures and amplifies sound inside the cover when the electronic device is in speaker-phone mode. For those electronic devices with a camera and flash, the lens frame incorporates fully integrated polycarbonate lenses for the camera and flash apertures of the cover. The cover&#39;s membrane over the home button is tear-resistant and waterproof and allows for \u201cfingerprint recognition\u201d or digital authentication technology.

The focus is on ensuring efficient insertion of a catheter into a target vessel, such as a vein or artery, for medical treatments. The challenge addressed is to facilitate seamless catheter insertion within constrained or hard-to-navigate vessels, enhancing stability and reliability of the procedure. A novel aspect of the technology is the provision of a catheter system, integrated with a sharp instrument and a flexible leader, that permits the catheter to be securely positioned within a vessel. The system incorporates an arrangement that allows for the sharp instrument and the flexible leader to be efficiently and safely retracted post-placement of the catheter, minimizing the risk of unintended vessel damage or procedural complications. This technology is of particular benefit in the context of slender or convoluted vessels and facilitates the medical professional's task of delivering care with a reduced risk of incidental tissue trauma, affording protection from exposure to patient fluids during and after the process.

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/358,099, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,690,833, filed Jan. 25, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/438,197, filed Jan. 31, 2011, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to devices and methods for insertion and placement of an access catheter into a vein or artery of a patient over a guidewire. Safe placement of an access catheter into the patient&#39;s vein or artery is particularly difficult in the case of small, tortuous, collapsed, fragile, and/or difficult to locate vessels. The risk of accidental punctures and/or contamination by the needle after placement of an intravenous catheter is a particular problem. It is therefore of interest to provide devices and methods which protect medical personnel from potential exposure to blood from the movement of the retracting guidewire. Of particular interest to the present invention, access catheters are often pre-packaged with both a needle and a guidewire where the needle is coaxially received over the guidewire and the catheter is coaxially received over the needle. The needle extends just beyond the distal tip of the catheter so that the assembly of the needle and catheter can be introduced into the vein or other vessel. As soon as entry into the vein is detected, typically by observing flashback, the guidewire can be advanced into the venous lumen, the catheter advanced over the guidewire, and both the needle and guidewire then removed from the catheter, leaving the catheter available for attachment to sources of fluids, drugs or other intravenous materials. Removal of the needle and guidewire can be problematic as they have a tendency to carry patient blood and risk the treating personnel to exposure. This can be a particular problem in the case of guidewires having a helical or other shaped tip, such as those described in at least some of the published U.S. patent applications listed below. For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide systems and methods for use with intravenous and other vascular access catheters to reduce the risk of blood loss and spattering where guidewires and/or needles are withdrawn from the catheter after placement. It would be particularly desirable if such methods and devices were compatible with venous catheters having automatic needle and guidewire retraction mechanisms, as described in the patent publications listed below. At least some of these objectives will be met by the invention as described herein. 2. Background Art The subject matter of the present invention is related to the following U.S. patent applications, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Each of the various embodiments of an intravenous catheter insertion device described in these patent applications can be combined with the intravenous catheter of the present invention to create an intravenous catheter system.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides venous and other vascular access catheters which are adapted to reduce the loss and spattering of blood upon withdrawal of needles and guidewires used to introduce the catheters. In particular, the present invention provides a catheter insertion device comprising an access catheter, a needle, a safety guidewire, and an actuator mechanism for selectively advancing the safety guidewire through the needle and selectively withdrawing both the needle and the safety guidewire from the catheter at desired points in the catheter insertion protocol. The present invention provides a chamber and a septum or other membrane as a \u201cwiping\u201d element on a proximal hub, housing, or other component of the access catheter. The chamber is preferably disposed at a proximal end of a hub having an interior chamber spaced apart from a proximal end of the catheter. A septum is preferably disposed on a proximal side of the chamber to wipe residual blood from the guidewire as the guidewire is withdrawn by the actuator. An insertion tool for the needle and/or guidewire is removably attached to the hub adjacent the septum so that the needle and guidewire may be advanced through the septum and into the catheter for selective advancement in order to permit introduction of the catheter into an artery or vein in a generally conventional manner. The actuator is further adapted to withdraw the needle and guidewire, typically under the force of a spring or other biasing element which rapidly withdraws the needle and catheter into and through the interior of the hub. Usually, the guidewire will be a \u201csafety\u201d guidewire having a helical or other preformed atraumatic shape at its distal end which is assumed when the safety guidewire exists from a distal tip of the needle in order to reduce the risk of damaging the vessel as the guidewire is advanced. As the guidewire is withdrawn, the safety tip will be straightened as it passes through the needle lumen and will resume the helical or other configuration within the interior of the hub, thus being able to shed blood which it may have picked up while in the artery or vein into the hub rather than into the surrounding tissue or housing. The guidewire can then be further withdrawn through the septum in order to remove any remaining blood before it is drawn back into the actuator for safe disposal. A side port, typically with a side tube, is provided on the hub in order to introduce desired fluids in order to accommodate the septum or other wiping element which is present on the proximal end of the hub.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of one embodiment of an intravenous catheter 100 and insertion device 20 according to the present invention. FIG. 2 shows an assembly drawing of the intravenous catheter 100 and insertion device 20 in an undeployed state, ready for use. Additional intravenous catheter insertion devices that can be used in the present invention are described in detail in the following patent applications: US 20100210934, US 20100094310 and US 20080300574, which have been incorporated by reference. The intravenous catheter insertion device 20 has a housing 21 , which includes a proximal housing 1 that is adhesively joined or otherwise connected to a distal housing 11. In the example shown, the proximal housing 1 is in the form of an elongated hollow cylinder. The distal housing 11 is optionally formed in an ergonomic handle shape designed to be held by the thumb and forefinger of a user. Other shapes are also possible. The housing 21 has an elongated slot 22 that extends from the proximal housing 1 to the distal housing 11 approximately parallel with a longitudinal axis of the housing 21. A wire advance slider 3 slides in a longitudinal direction along an exterior of the proximal housing 1 and the distal housing 11 and has a tongue 23 that extends through the slot 22 into the interior of the housing 21. A needle carrier 6 is slidable within the interior of the housing 21 and is positioned distal to the tongue 23 of the wire advance slider 3. The distal end of the needle carrier 6 includes a luer slip fitting 16 or the like. There is a notch 24 in the needle carrier 6 just proximal to the luer slip fitting 16. A button 25 is located on one side of the distal housing 11 , which has a tab 26 that is configured to engage the notch 24 in the needle carrier 6 when the needle carrier 6 is in its most distal position. A cylindrical guidewire stop 2 is adhesively bonded into the proximal end of the proximal housing 1. A tubular stainless steel hypodermic needle 7 with a sharpened, beveled distal end 29 is bonded with adhesive 13 or otherwise attached to the distal end of the needle carrier 6. Preferably, the needle 7 has one or more slots 27 cut into the sides of it connecting to the needle lumen for the passage of blood. A guidewire 9 is bonded with adhesive 14 or otherwise attached to the tongue 23 of the wire advance slider 3. The guidewire 9 is preferably made of a highly resilient material, such as a superelastic Nickel-Titanium alloy wire approximately 0.003-0.012 inches in diameter and most preferably approximately 0.004 inches in diameter. The guidewire 9 may be uniform in diameter or it may be made stepped or tapered in diameter, for example by grinding. For example, a 0.008 inch diameter wire can be centerless ground to create a 0.004 inch diameter distal portion with a short tapered transition. Optionally, a proximal portion of the guidewire 9 may be supported with a support tube 8 made from stainless steel or Nickel-Titanium alloy hypodermic tubing or a molded or extruded polymer tube. Another option for constructing the guidewire 9 would be to join a short distal portion of a highly resilient material, such as a superelastic Nickel-Titanium alloy wire, to a larger diameter, solid or tubular proximal portion, for example by welding, swaging, crimping and/or adhesive bonding. As best seen in FIG. 9 , the distal end of the guidewire 9 is preformed into a tightly wound spiral 28 with an outer diameter smaller than the internal diameter of the target vessel into which it will be inserted. The spiral tip 28 acts as a safety bumper on the guidewire 9 to avoid puncturing or damaging the inside of target vessels. The coiled guidewire tip 28 is particularly useful in protecting fragile or delicate veins. Due to the extreme flexibility of the Nickel-Titanium alloy wire, the spiral distal curve 28 can straighten out when the guidewire 9 is withdrawn into the needle 7 and completely recover into the spiral configuration without plastic deformation when the guidewire 9 is advanced out of the needle 7. In the example shown, the distal end of the guidewire 9 has a first, small diameter coil of approximately 0.167 inches in diameter for approximately 0.75 revolutions and a second, larger diameter coil of approximately 0.175 inches in diameter for approximately 1 revolution. The first and second coils are preferably approximately coplanar with one another and preferably approximately coplanar with the straight proximal portion 12 of the guidewire 9 also. Other configurations of the guidewire 9 may include: multi-planar, single coil, full radius on the end, and/or a balled end with a diameter less than the diameter of the needle. The guidewire 9 is positioned to move coaxially through the lumen of the needle 7. Optionally, a flexible tether 4 connects from the tongue 23 of the wire advance slider 3 to the proximal end of the needle carrier 6. Optionally, a needle carrier cap 5 may be provided to facilitate adhesively attaching the tether 4 to the proximal end of the needle carrier 6. The length of the tether 4 prevents the guidewire 9 from being withdrawn too far proximally with respect to the needle 7 because the small-diameter distal coil 28 would be difficult to reinsert into the proximal end of the needle 7 if it were to be completely withdrawn from the needle lumen. In another option, instead of using a tether, a plastic protrusion or another physical structure, such as a gate, can act as a detent to block the guidewire 9 from withdrawing beyond the desired point. Optionally, the detent may be configured so that it can be overrun when a forceful retraction occurs, such as the one that is initiated by the spring 10 , thus allowing complete retraction of the guidewire 9. In another option, the housing 21 may be configured such that the guidewire 9 or the structure that is connected to the guidewire 9 will hit a positive stop, such as the guidewire stop 2 or the proximal end of the housing 21 , before the guidewire 9 gets to a position too proximal relative to the needle 6. The proximal housing 1 , distal housing 11 , wire advance slider 3 , button 25 , needle carrier 6 , guidewire stop 2 and needle carrier cap 5 may be formed from any material suited for use in medical applications. For example, some or all of these parts may be molded and/or machined from a rigid, transparent medical grade plastic, such as acrylic or polycarbonate. A compression spring 10 or similar biasing member is positioned between the needle carrier 6 and the distal end of the housing 21 to urge the needle carrier 6 in a proximal direction. The force of the spring 10 is resisted by the tab 26 of the button 25 , which engages the notch 24 in the needle carrier 6 when the needle carrier 6 is in its most distal position. It should be noted that in FIG. 1 the spring 10 is shown in a compressed condition as it would be in the assembled intravenous catheter insertion device 20 in an undeployed condition. The intravenous catheter 100 , which is shown in an enlarged view in FIG. 6 , has a catheter tube 102 with an inner lumen that fits coaxially around the needle 7 of the insertion device 20. The catheter tube 102 is preferably extruded of a flexible medical grade polymer having a low coefficient of friction, for example PTFE, polypropylene or polyethylene. Preferably, the intravenous catheter tube 102 has a close fit with the needle 7 and a tapered distal end to minimize any step between the needle 7 and the catheter tube 102 as they are inserted through the wall of a vein. The proximal end of the catheter tube 102 is connected to a proximal fitting 104 that connects to the distal end of a flexible sidearm tube 106 , which extends laterally from the side of the proximal fitting 104. Preferably, the proximal fitting 104 is molded of a clear polymer so that blood flashback from the needle 7 can be observed in the proximal fitting 104. A luer fitting 108 or the like is attached to the proximal end of the sidearm tube 106. A fluid flow path is formed from the luer fitting 108 through the sidearm tube 106 to the proximal fitting 104 and the catheter tube 102. Preferably, the fluid flow path is free of obstructions, sudden changes of diameter or dead spaces that would interfere with fluid flow or be a nidus for thrombus formation. Optionally, the intravenous catheter 100 may include wings 105 , which facilitate taping the intravenous catheter 100 to the patient&#39;s skin after insertion. The wings 105 may be rigid or flexible and, optionally, may be molded integrally with the proximal fitting 104. A hemostasis valve 110 is located on a proximal side of the proximal fitting 104. The hemostasis valve 110 is preferably configured as an elastomeric membrane 112 with a small hole 114 at the center of the elastomeric membrane 112. The hole 114 forms a sliding seal around the needle 7 of the insertion device 20. Alternatively, the elastomeric membrane 112 may be intact and the needle 7 will form a hole 114 as it is inserted through the membrane 112. The elastomeric membrane 112 can be made of latex, silicone, polyurethane or another medical grade elastomer. Optionally, a small amount of medical grade lubricant, such as silicone oil, may be used to reduce the friction of the needle 7 passing through the hemostasis valve 110. Other configurations of hemostasis valves known in the industry, such as those having different configurations of membranes, holes, slits or duckbill valves, may also be used. Optionally, more than one or a combination of different hemostasis valves 110 may be used. Optionally, located proximal to the hemostasis valve 110 is a wiping element 120. The wiping element 120 is adapted to remove blood from the surface of the guidewire 9 and needle 7 as they are withdrawn from the intravenous catheter 100. The wiping element 120 may be made of an absorbent or superabsorbent material to absorb blood from the surface of the needle 7 and guidewire 9. Examples of suitable materials include, but are not limited to, cotton wool, gauze, felt, natural or artificial sponge, open-cell foam, etc. Alternatively, the wiping element 120 may be configured as an elastomeric membrane that acts like a squeegee to remove blood from the surface of the guidewire 9."

  "pos": "This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 480,648, filed Feb. 15, 1990. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a constant-rate discharge valve and an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer using such a discharge valve. 2. Description of the Prior Art Conventionally, a manual sphygmomanometer is provided with a constant-rate discharge valve. Such a valve is provided at the entrance of a rubber bulb for inflating a cuff, and the cuff is deflated at a constant rate by manually adjusting a regulating valve. In order to measure blood pressure using such a manual sphygmomanometer, first the cuff pressure is raised to a value above systolic blood pressure, after which the cuff pressure is adjusted manually by the regulating valve to deflate the cuff at a constant rate. During this deflation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measured by detecting Korotkoff sounds. In an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer, the constant-rate discharge valve cannot be manually adjusted. For this reason, the constant-rate discharge valve used is so adapted that the cuff is deflated at a constant rate. FIG. 4A is a front view of a conventional constant-rate discharge valve, and FIG. 4B is a side view of the conventional constant-rate discharge valve. These views show a typical arrangement of a constant-rate discharge valve employed in an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer. With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, there is shown a constant-rate discharge valve main body 100 having one end open to the atmosphere and another end formed into a hollow cylindrical member penetrated by a small orifice 101. The valve is fitted into a pipe T indicated by the slanting lines. As for the operation of the constant-rate valve thus constructed, air which is passed through the interior of the pipe T is discharged at a constant rate by passing through the orifice 101. Thus, the constant-rate discharge valve of the manual sphygmomanometer involves difficulty in terms of operation, as mentioned above. Though the constant-rate discharge valve of the fully automatic sphygmomanometer constructed as described above eliminates this difficulty, it is difficult to maintain the precisely machined state of the orifice, and therefore disparities in dimensions and shape arise. As a result, it is difficult to maintain a constant discharge state without variance. Another problem is that the amount of discharged air cannot be adjusted with the fully automatic sphygmomanometer constructed as described above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a constant-rate discharge valve which does not require a troublesome operation and is capable of maintaining a constant discharge state without variance, as well as a fully automatic sphygmomanometer employing this constant-rate discharge valve. Another object of the present invention is to provide a constant-rate discharge valve in which discharge flow rate can be adjusted, as well as an electronic sphygmomanometer which employs this constant-rate discharge valve. In order to attain the foregoing object, the present invention provides a constant-rate discharge valve adapted so as to render a discharge rate constant, comprising a housing having an internal air chamber and a hole open to the atmosphere, first and second air passageways each having one end open to the air chamber and communicating with each other via the air chamber, the second air passageway having a control orifice for controlling air flow rate, and a valve body disposed in the housing so as to partition the air chamber from the hole, the valve body interrupting communication between the first and second air passageways when pressure in the air chamber is greater than a predetermined pressure and permitting communication between the first and second air passageways when the pressure in the air chamber is less the predetermined pressure. In a preferred embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve, air which has flown in from the first air passageway passes through the air chamber and the control orifice and is discharged into the atmosphere from the second air passageway, at which time the valve body is actuated by a pressure difference across upstream and downstream sides of the control orifice produced by the flow rate of the entrant air, the valve body being closed by the pressure difference when the pressure difference is large and opened by the pressure difference when the pressure difference is small, whereby the flow rate of air discharged from the second air passageway is rendered constant. Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1A is a partial sectional view illustrating a first embodiment of a constant-rate discharge valve according to the present invention, in which the central portion of the valve is shown partially broken away; FIG. 1B is a bottom view showing the first embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve; FIG. 2 is a partial sectional view illustrating a second embodiment of a constant-rate discharge valve according to the present invention, in which the central portion of the valve is shown partially broken away; FIG. 3 is a schematic view of piping showing the pneumatic pressure system of an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer using the constant-rate discharge valve of the invention; FIG. 4A is a front view showing a constant-rate discharge valve according to the prior art; and FIG. 4B is a side view of the constant-rate discharge valve according to the prior art. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Preferred embodiments in which the constant-rate discharge valve of the present invention is applied will now be described with reference to the drawings. With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, there is shown a cylindrical housing 1 the upper side of which is integrally formed to have an air inlet port 6 and an air outlet port 5 in such a manner that these ports communicate with an air chamber 4 within the housing 1. The air inlet port 6 is formed as a hollow projection in such a manner that a flexible plastic tube serving as piping, described below, may be connected thereto with ease. As will be set forth later, the valve is connected to an electronic sphygmomanometer via the flexible plastic tube. The central portion of the housing 1 at which the outlet port 5 is provided is formed to have a control orifice 10 of the kind shown. Control of the discharge operation is performed via the control orifice 10. A diaphragm 8 made of rubber is disposed within the housing 1 and is capable of moving up and down in the drawing of FIG. 1A so as to vary the volume of the air chamber 4. The diaphragm 8 is provided at its approximate center with a valve 11 via a rod 9. The upper portion of the valve 11 is provided with a gate body 12. A flange 13 having a flange hole 13A is formed at approximately the central portion of the housing 1. The valve 11 is capable of assuming a state (not shown) in which its lower surface seals off the upper surface of the flange 13, and a state in which its lower surface opens the upper surface of the flange 13. This latter state is that illustrated in FIG. 1A. More specifically, with the valve 11 in the state illustrated, which is the non-actuated state, air which flows in from the inlet port 6 in the direction of the arrow in FIG. 1A passes through the gap between the lower surface of the valve 11 and the wall of the flange hole 13A, after which the air passes through the air chamber 4 and then freely through outlet port 5 to be released into the atmosphere, as indicated by the arrow. The lower surface of the valve 11 and the wall at the mouth of the flange hole 13A are formed to be smooth so that the former will come into snug abutting contact with the latter. In order that the valve 11 will reliably contact and seal off the mouth of the flange hole 13A even under the action of a very small force, the mouth of the flange hole 13A is provided with an annular projection 14. An annular clearance is defined between the inner wall of the flange hole 13A and the outer wall of the rod 9 connecting the diaphragm 8 to the valve 11. In order to achieve the required air flow rate without impediment, the dimensions of this clearance are obtained through calculation, described below. The lower surface of the housing 1 along the inner circumference thereof is smoothly finished at its surface of contact with the diaphragm 8 in order to maintain the diaphragm 8 in a hermetically sealed (air light) state with the housing 1. It is also arranged so that when the valve is assembled to clamp the diaphragm 8 between the housing 1 and a back-up body or cover 3, no air will leak from the surface of contact with the diaphragm 8 (i.e., the assembly is an air tight). Further, the housing 1 is provided over its entire outer circumference with a fitting member 1A so that when the back-up body or cover 3 is fitted onto the outer circumferential portion of the housing 1, the illustrated assembled state can be achieved even if separate, special-purpose mounting parts are not provided. The diaphragm 8 is made of rubber or flexible plastic and is integrally molded with the valve 11, as set forth above. The entire outer circumferential portion of the diaphragm 8 preferably is provided with a projection 9A that is readily depressed to form a hermetic air tight seal at the surface of contact with the housing 1 after assembly. The slender gate shaft 12 at the distal end of the valve 11 is the residue of a gate portion that is for injecting the raw material of rubber or the like when the valve 11 and diaphragm 8 are integrally molded. By leaving this gate portion attached, the gate shaft 12 can be pulled upward from the side of the inlet port 6 at the time of assembly when the valve 11 whose outer diameter is larger than the inner diameter of the flange hole 13A is passed through the flange hole 13A. By pulling up the gate shaft 12 in this manner, the valve 11 is forcibly fitted into the flange hole 13A. This facilitates the assembly operation. The back-up body or cover 3 is assembled in such a manner that the diaphragm 8 is sandwiched between it and the housing 1, as described earlier. The purpose of this is to hermetically seal the air chamber 4 by pressing the diaphragm 8 against the housing 1, and to attach the diaphragm to the housing in an air-tight state. Accordingly, the surface of the back-up body or cover 3 where it contacts the diaphragm 8 is formed so that the inner diameter of the back-up body is the same as the diameter of the housing 1. The back-up body or cover 3 is provided with open holes or openings 15 in communication with the atmosphere in order that the pressure acting upon the diaphragm will be equal to atmospheric pressure. In order to prevent the valve 11 from being forced out through the flange hole 13A owing to an excessive force which acts upon the valve 11 when the diaphragm 8 is subjected to an excessive force, the arrangement is such that the diaphragm 8 will abut against the inner surface of the back-up body or cover 3 if the diaphragm expands by more than a prescribed amount. Thus, the diaphragm 8 cannot expand excessively and the valve 11 is prevented from sustaining damage. Fitting members 3A are provided on the outer circumferential portion of the back-up body or cover 3 at eight equally spaced locations in order that these may mate with the fitting member IA provided on the outer circumferential portion of the housing 1. The dimensions of the fitting member 3A are such that the housing 1 and the outer circumferential portion of the back-up body or cover 3 will mate at a position where they will be in contact with the surface of the diaphragm 8 along its entire circumference to snugly compress the projection 9A on the outer circumferential portion of the diaphragm. In general, the amount of flexure of the diaphragm is expressed numerically in the form of a disk-shaped diaphragm whose periphery is fixed. The details are also set forth in handbooks on mechanical engineering. Letting P represent the desired pressure, d the clearance between the valve 11 and the inner wall of the flange hole 13A, t the thickness of the diaphragm 8, R the radius of the diaphragm 8 and E Young&#39;s modulus of the diaphragm 8, we have the following equation: ##EQU1## In the foregoing equation, 1/m is Poisson&#39;s ratio, which is approximately 0.5 for rubber; hence, m=2. If rubber having a Young&#39;s modulus of 24 kgf/cm 2 is used and the valve is set to operate at a pressure of 20 mmHg, then the pressure will be P=20 mmHg=0.026 kgf/cm 2. Therefore, if the diaphragm has a radius of 1 cm and a thickness of 0.1 cm, we have ##EQU2## Thus, the dimensions of the various parts should be set in such a manner that the clearance between the valve and the wall of the flange hole will be 1.52 mm. Rubber, besides exhibiting viscoelasticity, is such that the Young&#39;s modulus thereof varies widely with the temperature at which it is used. In addition, the precision of the operating pressure of a rubber diaphragm varies widely owing to the influence of temperature and the like. Moreover, in terms of designing a valve which operates at high pressure, diaphragm thickness is very large because the Young&#39;s modulus of rubber is exceedingly small. Accordingly, it is permissible to superimpose a metal diaphragm on the abovementioned rubber diaphragm 8, thus constructing a valve which will operate at high pressure even with use of the rubber diaphragm 8. The metal diaphragm can be made of, e.g., stainless steel, in which case Young&#39;s modulus would be as large as 2\u00d7107 kgf/cm 2. Therefore, the operating pressure of the valve would be determined not from the elastic force of rubber but from the physical properties of a substantially metal diaphragm. It is also permissible to cut away a portion of the metal diaphragm. FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of the constant-rate discharge valve of the invention, in which portions similar to those shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are designated by like reference characters and need not be described again. Only structural elements different from those of the embodiment of FIGS. 1A and 1B will be described. The inner circumferential surface of the outlet port 5 of the constant-rate discharge valve is formed to have threads 5a, and the control orifice 10 is shaped to have angular portions, of the kind shown, at its upper and lower parts. A screw body 20 threadedly engaged with the threads 5a has a conical lower portion 20a, a groove portion 20b and an adjustment recess 20c. A clearance, namely a control passage, is formed between the angular portions of the control orifice 10 and the outer circumferential surface of the conical portion 20a. In order to adjust the control passage, a screwdriver or the like is inserted into the adjustment recess 20c and the screw body 20 is turned to regulate the clearance formed between the angular portions of the control orifice 10 and the outer circumferential surface of the conical portion 20a. Air is discharged by passing through the groove 20b. FIG. 3 shows the overall piping T of an electronic automatic sphygmomanometer employing the constant-rate discharge valve 1. A cuff 34 and a motor-driven pump 24 are connected by a four-branch pipe junction T1 and a two-branch pipe junction T2. The inlet port 6 of the constant-rate discharge valve 1 is connected to the upwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1. A pressure sensor 32 is connected via a two-branch pipe junction T2 to the leftwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1, and the cuff 34 is connected to the leftwardly directed portion of this two-branch pipe junction T2. The outlet port of a filter device 30 comprising a fluidic resistor and a fluid buffer bag is connected to the downwardly directed portion of the four-branch pipe junction T1. The motor-driven pump 24 is connected to the inlet port of the filter device 30 via a two-branch pipe junction T2. Connected to the upwardly directed portion of this pipe junction T2 via another two-branch pipe junction T2 are a bypass valve 26 having an electromagnetically driven solenoid, and a discharge valve 22 similarly having an electromagnetically driven solenoid. When the pressure within the cuff 34 is less than 20 mmHg in this electronic automatic sphygmomanometer thus connected, air from the motor-driven pump 24 is caused to flow directly into the cuff 34 to inflate and deflate the cuff efficiently in a short period of time. Specifically, when cuff pressure is less than 20 mmHg, the bypass valve 26 is in the open state to allow passage of the air therethrough. As a result, the air flows directed from the pump 24 to the interior of the cuff 34. When the cuff pressure rises to a value greater than 20 mmHg, on the other hand, the bypass valve 26 is closed to prevent air from passing through it. As a result, the air passes through the filter device 30 interposed in the pneumatic line extending from the motor-driven pump 24 to the cuff 34. The filter device 30, which comprises the abovementioned filtering elements such as the fluidic resistance element, functions as a rectifying circuit. As a result, the cuff 34 is supplied with air at a constant rate without any pulsation in cuff pressure when blood pressure is measured."

  "query": "What innovations are described for securing a patient's arm during surgical procedures?,",
  "negative": "The improved method introduced pertains to managing the stability and convenience of positioning a patient's limbs during operative processes. Notably, during medical treatments, patients often require their limbs to be immobilized to enhance both safety and procedural accuracy. This presents a challenge in optimizing limb stabilization without obstructing staff access or causing patient discomfort. While devices exist for limb support, they are regularly deficient in flexibility, accessibility, and comfort, potentially complicating the surgery and posing risks of tissue damage. The innovation introduces a flexible system for limb positioning through a series of adjustable components that adapt to the natural contours of the patient's limbs, ensuring secure placement without impeding medical staff, promoting patient protection, and eliminating many of the common limitations associated with previous limb stabilization solutions. This system is intended to harmonize the need for patient security with the practical demands of surgical operations.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/221,492, filed Jun. 29, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Disclosure The disclosure relates to devices for providing support and protection for a patient&#39;s arms during medical procedures. 2. Description of the Related Art Often during medical procedures, for example surgery, a patient may be under a general anesthetic or sedated to such an extent that he or she cannot protect or support himself/herself, as well as voice or indicate pain or discomfort to those in care of him/her. In addition, the precision and accuracy of the outcome of the medical procedure may be greatly improved by maintaining the patient in a secure and motionless position. The medical staff is responsible for taking every precaution to protect the patient when he or she is most vulnerable and unable to protect himself/herself. A number of devices have been developed to support and protect the arms of a patient in these circumstances. Rigid arm boards, on which the patient&#39;s arms are placed in various degrees of abduction from their body, often work quite well. However, when medical personnel need the arms positioned close to the body, these arm boards may prove too bulky and can often interfere with access to the patient for both the staff and equipment. In certain laparoscopic surgeries, including robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery, the patient&#39;s arms need to be snuggly adducted to their sides. Often a draw sheet is placed under the patient and the arms are tucked in to the patient&#39;s side. This maneuver can sometimes dislodge sites of vascular access or binding and create pressure points along the patient&#39;s arms, resulting in injury and damage to the nerves, which can be more problematic for the patient&#39;s recovery than the original surgery. Arm sleds or toboggans (named for their resemblance to such items) have also been used with varying success. These are often made of rigid plastic or metal. The \u201cC\u201d shaped end of these devices cradles the arm and the extended portion passes under the mattress beneath the patient. These devices can be cumbersome to position since the mattress on a surgical table is usually secured in the middle from head to toe with a wide strip of VELCRO\u00ae brand hook-and-loop fasteners. Most often the sled has to be positioned with the mattress lifted up. If sleds are needed for both arms, the mechanics of the problem become compounded. In addition, these sleds are very rigid, can interfere with the access of the medical staff to the patient, and are not very forgiving of the soft tissue or bones of the patient. Additional padding is often required, and pressure points are common since the weight of the patient&#39;s arm is not evenly distributed. Finally these devices can interfere with radiographic imaging, especially the metal sleds. A number of arm supports have been developed. Many rely on single or multiple straps or strap and buckle variations to secure the arms to the patient&#39;s side. In some models the patient ultimately rests on top of the strap which can press into the skin of the back. In other devices, releasing the device requires moving the patient from side to side. Certain devices support only the forearm. Existing devices may not evenly distribute or support the weight of the arm, which may create pressure points, which in turn may cause injuries. Some devices, for example the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,861,666, cover part of the torso of the patient as well as the arms, which may interfere with medical procedures. Other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0091749, have protector sections that wrap over the arm from the outside of the arm and that are connected to a surface of the device. The attachment tape that connects the protector sections to the surface is positioned between the patient&#39;s arm and the patient&#39;s body, so it may be difficult to see the attachment tape to secure or release it, especially if the patient&#39;s body is resting on the attachment tape. Also, because the attachment tape connects to a protector section at only one point, an entire protector section must be either secured around the arm or not secured around the arm. Some other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. 2008/0053464, have sleeves that hold the arms and have straps to secure the device in place. However, these straps may create pressure points, and the sleeves allow an entire arm to only be either covered or uncovered. Also, positioning the arm in the sleeve may require moving the patient&#39;s body. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE The devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the invention, certain features will now be discussed briefly. In one embodiment, a patient restraint device comprises a body section dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, wherein the body section includes first and second lateral edges, a first arm restraint attached to the first lateral edge, wherein the first arm restraint includes a first flexible member that is dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along a first length comprising a length of the patient&#39;s first arm from a location adjacent the patient&#39;s shoulder to a location adjacent the patient&#39;s wrist, and extend about a bottom surface and an outer periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm, and wherein the first arm restraint further includes a second flexible member dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along the first length, and extend about an inner periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm and mate with the first flexible member substantially continuously along the first length. In one embodiment, a patient restraining device comprises a support surface dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, a flexible inner panel dimensioned to extend about an inner periphery of a first arm of the patient, and a flexible outer panel dimensioned to extend about an outer periphery of the first arm to define a space with the flexible inner panel, wherein the space is dimensioned to receive the first arm. In one embodiment, a method for securing an arm of a patient comprises resting a torso of a patient on a support surface, positioning a first flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm proximate to the torso along a first length, wherein the first length substantially extends from the patient&#39;s shoulder to the patient&#39;s wrist, and positioning a second flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm distal to the torso along the first length, thereby positioning the arm in a space defined by the first and second flexible members.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner, simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the inventions herein described. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a soft surgical arm support 100. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , the soft surgical arm support 100 includes a first panel 110 and a second panel 120. In one embodiment, the first panel 110 is made from 5 mm neoprene. Other embodiments may be made include other materials or material of different thicknesses, including other polymers (for example, synthetic rubbers, nylon, and polyester), synthetic fibers (for example, spandex), and/or natural fibers (for example, paper and cotton). Some materials may advantageously not interfere with radiologic imaging of the patent, may be hypoallergenic, and/or may be very durable. Depending on the embodiment, the soft surgical arm support 100 may be disposable or reusable. The other components of the soft surgical arm support 100 may be made from the same materials that the first panel 110 may be made from. The first panel 110 is proximate to the patient and includes a support surface 115. The first panel 110 may be completely or partially covered by a fleece material 140. The fleece material 140 may provide extra cushioning for a patient and may provide a surface that is more comfortable to a patient&#39;s skin. The fleece material 140 may act as a fastener, for example the loop surface of a hook-and-loop fastener. The first panel 110 includes one or more first flexible members 113. A first flexible member 113 may include a portion of the first panel 110 adjacent to an edge of the first panel 110 that may move independently of the second panel 120. In one embodiment, one or more of the first flexible members 113 extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the first panel 110. The fleece material 140 may cover all or part of the first flexible member 113. The second panel 120 includes one or more second flexible members 123. A second flexible member 123 may include a portion of the second panel 120 near an edge of the second panel 120 that moves independently of the first panel 110. A second flexible member 123 may extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the second panel 120 and includes a fastener, for example a fastening surface 130. The fastening surface 130 may extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123. The first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be dimensioned to continuously extend along a length substantially equal to a distance between a patient&#39;s wrist and shoulder. The first flexible member 113 may be coupled to the second flexible member 123 , thereby defining a space 150. The space 150 may be dimensioned to receive an arm of a patient, and, for example, may substantially be in the shape of an open-ended cylinder. For example, the first flexible member 113 is bent in an arc to form a first part of a circumference of the space 150 and the second flexible member 123 is bent in an arc to form a second part of the circumference of the space 150. The second flexible member 123 overlaps the first flexible member 113 , and the first flexible member 113 is coupled to the second flexible member 123 at the overlap, for example using the fastening surface 130 and the fleece 140. Alternatively, the first flexible member 113 may overlap the second flexible member 123. Also, some embodiments may omit the first flexible member 113 or the second flexible member 123 , and the remaining flexible member may wrap over the arm to be coupled to the support surface 150. In one embodiment, the first flexible member 113 includes a loop surface, such as the fleece material 140 , and the second flexible member 123 includes a hook surface 130 , though the positions of the hook and/or loop surfaces may be switched. The fasteners on both the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be on the side proximal to the patient or distal to the patient, thereby creating a standing seam that extends away from or a seam that extends toward the patient&#39;s arm when the first flexible member is coupled to the second flexible member 123. Also, in other embodiments the first flexible member 113 does not overlap the second flexible member 123 or other fasteners are used, including adhesives (e.g., temporary adhesives), buttons, zippers, and laces. The second flexible member 123 and/or the first flexible member 113 , as well as the space 150 , may be substantially the same length as a patient&#39;s arm. This advantageously provides support or protection for substantially the entire arm. For example, the soft surgical arm support 100 may provide an extra layer of protection against cuts, scrapes, punctures, burns, etc., caused by undesired contact with surgical instruments, chemicals, etc. Also, in embodiments in which the fastening surfaces (for example, the fastening surface 130 and the fleece material 140 ) extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 , the second flexible member 123 may be coupled to the first flexible member 113 along substantially the entire length of the arm. This may distribute the force holding the arm in place along substantially the entire length of the arm, thereby reducing or eliminating pressure points on the arm. This advantageously reduces the risk of injury to a patient from pressure points, especially a patient who is sedated or unconscious. In use, the soft surgical arm support 100 is positioned on a patient bed. Since the soft surgical arm support 100 may be placed on top, there is no need to lift the bed or mattress to position the soft surgical arm support 100. A patient is positioned by lying down on the support surface 115. The first flexible member 113 is positioned around the inner periphery of the arm. The second flexible member 123 is positioned around the outer periphery of the arm, thereby positioning the arm in the space 150. The second flexible member 123 is coupled to the first flexible member 113 to secure the first flexible member 113 to the second flexible member 123 , thereby securing the arm in place. It will be appreciated that positioning the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may require little or no movement of the patient. The patient&#39;s arm may need to be lifted, but the patient&#39;s body does not need to be lifted from the support surface 115 to position the arm in the space. This reduces the risk of injury to the patient, who may be unconscious, heavily sedated, or otherwise unable to voluntarily move, and to medical personnel who would otherwise need to lift the patient. It also reduces the need to have multiple medical personnel lift and move the patient or the need to use equipment, for example a lift, to move the patient. It increases the speed of securing the arm of the patient and further allows the arm to be quickly released to provide rapid access to the arm in an emergency. Moreover, in some embodiments the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 extend to an upper surface of the circumference of the arm, which advantageously positions the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 on top of the arm, increasing the visibility of the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113. This further facilitates uncoupling the second flexible member 123 from the first flexible member 113 because the arm and the patient do not need to be moved to uncouple the members and because medical personnel can easily see where to grasp the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 to uncouple them. This improves access to the arm of the patient, for example to attach a medical device to the arm (such as an IV, a sensor, a bandage, etc.), to perform a medical procedure on the arm, or to release the arm. It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments the first flexible member 113 may be selectively decoupled from the second flexible member 123 along a portion of the interface between the members. This may allow medical personnel to access a portion of the arm while permitting the arm to be supported and protected by the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123. For example, medical personnel may decouple the first flexible member 113 from the second flexible member 123 adjacent to the forearm to attach an IV to the patient while leaving the first flexible member 113 coupled to the second flexible member 123 along the rest of the length of the arm (including the upper arm and wrist, for example), thereby holding the arm in place and protecting the enclosed portion of the arm while the IV is attached. Medical personal may adjust the location where they decouple the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 to access the arm in order to account for differences in arm lengths. Furthermore, some fasteners, for example hook-and-loop fasteners, may be coupled around a medical device (for example, a tube or a wire), which allows the arm to be re-enclosed in the space 150 while leaving the medical device attached to the arm and providing additional support to hold the medical device in a desired position."

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/221,492, filed Jun. 29, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Disclosure The disclosure relates to devices for providing support and protection for a patient&#39;s arms during medical procedures. 2. Description of the Related Art Often during medical procedures, for example surgery, a patient may be under a general anesthetic or sedated to such an extent that he or she cannot protect or support himself/herself, as well as voice or indicate pain or discomfort to those in care of him/her. In addition, the precision and accuracy of the outcome of the medical procedure may be greatly improved by maintaining the patient in a secure and motionless position. The medical staff is responsible for taking every precaution to protect the patient when he or she is most vulnerable and unable to protect himself/herself. A number of devices have been developed to support and protect the arms of a patient in these circumstances. Rigid arm boards, on which the patient&#39;s arms are placed in various degrees of abduction from their body, often work quite well. However, when medical personnel need the arms positioned close to the body, these arm boards may prove too bulky and can often interfere with access to the patient for both the staff and equipment. In certain laparoscopic surgeries, including robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery, the patient&#39;s arms need to be snuggly adducted to their sides. Often a draw sheet is placed under the patient and the arms are tucked in to the patient&#39;s side. This maneuver can sometimes dislodge sites of vascular access or binding and create pressure points along the patient&#39;s arms, resulting in injury and damage to the nerves, which can be more problematic for the patient&#39;s recovery than the original surgery. Arm sleds or toboggans (named for their resemblance to such items) have also been used with varying success. These are often made of rigid plastic or metal. The \u201cC\u201d shaped end of these devices cradles the arm and the extended portion passes under the mattress beneath the patient. These devices can be cumbersome to position since the mattress on a surgical table is usually secured in the middle from head to toe with a wide strip of VELCRO\u00ae brand hook-and-loop fasteners. Most often the sled has to be positioned with the mattress lifted up. If sleds are needed for both arms, the mechanics of the problem become compounded. In addition, these sleds are very rigid, can interfere with the access of the medical staff to the patient, and are not very forgiving of the soft tissue or bones of the patient. Additional padding is often required, and pressure points are common since the weight of the patient&#39;s arm is not evenly distributed. Finally these devices can interfere with radiographic imaging, especially the metal sleds. A number of arm supports have been developed. Many rely on single or multiple straps or strap and buckle variations to secure the arms to the patient&#39;s side. In some models the patient ultimately rests on top of the strap which can press into the skin of the back. In other devices, releasing the device requires moving the patient from side to side. Certain devices support only the forearm. Existing devices may not evenly distribute or support the weight of the arm, which may create pressure points, which in turn may cause injuries. Some devices, for example the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,861,666, cover part of the torso of the patient as well as the arms, which may interfere with medical procedures. Other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2005/0091749, have protector sections that wrap over the arm from the outside of the arm and that are connected to a surface of the device. The attachment tape that connects the protector sections to the surface is positioned between the patient&#39;s arm and the patient&#39;s body, so it may be difficult to see the attachment tape to secure or release it, especially if the patient&#39;s body is resting on the attachment tape. Also, because the attachment tape connects to a protector section at only one point, an entire protector section must be either secured around the arm or not secured around the arm. Some other devices, for example the device describe in U.S. Patent Pub. 2008/0053464, have sleeves that hold the arms and have straps to secure the device in place. However, these straps may create pressure points, and the sleeves allow an entire arm to only be either covered or uncovered. Also, positioning the arm in the sleeve may require moving the patient&#39;s body. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE The devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the invention, certain features will now be discussed briefly. In one embodiment, a patient restraint device comprises a body section dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, wherein the body section includes first and second lateral edges, a first arm restraint attached to the first lateral edge, wherein the first arm restraint includes a first flexible member that is dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along a first length comprising a length of the patient&#39;s first arm from a location adjacent the patient&#39;s shoulder to a location adjacent the patient&#39;s wrist, and extend about a bottom surface and an outer periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm, and wherein the first arm restraint further includes a second flexible member dimensioned to extend substantially continuously along the first length, and extend about an inner periphery of the patient&#39;s first arm and mate with the first flexible member substantially continuously along the first length. In one embodiment, a patient restraining device comprises a support surface dimensioned to receive a torso of a patient, a flexible inner panel dimensioned to extend about an inner periphery of a first arm of the patient, and a flexible outer panel dimensioned to extend about an outer periphery of the first arm to define a space with the flexible inner panel, wherein the space is dimensioned to receive the first arm. In one embodiment, a method for securing an arm of a patient comprises resting a torso of a patient on a support surface, positioning a first flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm proximate to the torso along a first length, wherein the first length substantially extends from the patient&#39;s shoulder to the patient&#39;s wrist, and positioning a second flexible member over a surface of the patient&#39;s arm distal to the torso along the first length, thereby positioning the arm in a space defined by the first and second flexible members.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner, simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the inventions herein described. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a soft surgical arm support 100. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , the soft surgical arm support 100 includes a first panel 110 and a second panel 120. In one embodiment, the first panel 110 is made from 5 mm neoprene. Other embodiments may be made include other materials or material of different thicknesses, including other polymers (for example, synthetic rubbers, nylon, and polyester), synthetic fibers (for example, spandex), and/or natural fibers (for example, paper and cotton). Some materials may advantageously not interfere with radiologic imaging of the patent, may be hypoallergenic, and/or may be very durable. Depending on the embodiment, the soft surgical arm support 100 may be disposable or reusable. The other components of the soft surgical arm support 100 may be made from the same materials that the first panel 110 may be made from. The first panel 110 is proximate to the patient and includes a support surface 115. The first panel 110 may be completely or partially covered by a fleece material 140. The fleece material 140 may provide extra cushioning for a patient and may provide a surface that is more comfortable to a patient&#39;s skin. The fleece material 140 may act as a fastener, for example the loop surface of a hook-and-loop fastener. The first panel 110 includes one or more first flexible members 113. A first flexible member 113 may include a portion of the first panel 110 adjacent to an edge of the first panel 110 that may move independently of the second panel 120. In one embodiment, one or more of the first flexible members 113 extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the first panel 110. The fleece material 140 may cover all or part of the first flexible member 113. The second panel 120 includes one or more second flexible members 123. A second flexible member 123 may include a portion of the second panel 120 near an edge of the second panel 120 that moves independently of the first panel 110. A second flexible member 123 may extend substantially the entire length of an edge of the second panel 120 and includes a fastener, for example a fastening surface 130. The fastening surface 130 may extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123. The first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be dimensioned to continuously extend along a length substantially equal to a distance between a patient&#39;s wrist and shoulder. The first flexible member 113 may be coupled to the second flexible member 123 , thereby defining a space 150. The space 150 may be dimensioned to receive an arm of a patient, and, for example, may substantially be in the shape of an open-ended cylinder. For example, the first flexible member 113 is bent in an arc to form a first part of a circumference of the space 150 and the second flexible member 123 is bent in an arc to form a second part of the circumference of the space 150. The second flexible member 123 overlaps the first flexible member 113 , and the first flexible member 113 is coupled to the second flexible member 123 at the overlap, for example using the fastening surface 130 and the fleece 140. Alternatively, the first flexible member 113 may overlap the second flexible member 123. Also, some embodiments may omit the first flexible member 113 or the second flexible member 123 , and the remaining flexible member may wrap over the arm to be coupled to the support surface 150. In one embodiment, the first flexible member 113 includes a loop surface, such as the fleece material 140 , and the second flexible member 123 includes a hook surface 130 , though the positions of the hook and/or loop surfaces may be switched. The fasteners on both the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may be on the side proximal to the patient or distal to the patient, thereby creating a standing seam that extends away from or a seam that extends toward the patient&#39;s arm when the first flexible member is coupled to the second flexible member 123. Also, in other embodiments the first flexible member 113 does not overlap the second flexible member 123 or other fasteners are used, including adhesives (e.g., temporary adhesives), buttons, zippers, and laces. The second flexible member 123 and/or the first flexible member 113 , as well as the space 150 , may be substantially the same length as a patient&#39;s arm. This advantageously provides support or protection for substantially the entire arm. For example, the soft surgical arm support 100 may provide an extra layer of protection against cuts, scrapes, punctures, burns, etc., caused by undesired contact with surgical instruments, chemicals, etc. Also, in embodiments in which the fastening surfaces (for example, the fastening surface 130 and the fleece material 140 ) extend substantially the entire length of the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 , the second flexible member 123 may be coupled to the first flexible member 113 along substantially the entire length of the arm. This may distribute the force holding the arm in place along substantially the entire length of the arm, thereby reducing or eliminating pressure points on the arm. This advantageously reduces the risk of injury to a patient from pressure points, especially a patient who is sedated or unconscious. In use, the soft surgical arm support 100 is positioned on a patient bed. Since the soft surgical arm support 100 may be placed on top, there is no need to lift the bed or mattress to position the soft surgical arm support 100. A patient is positioned by lying down on the support surface 115. The first flexible member 113 is positioned around the inner periphery of the arm. The second flexible member 123 is positioned around the outer periphery of the arm, thereby positioning the arm in the space 150. The second flexible member 123 is coupled to the first flexible member 113 to secure the first flexible member 113 to the second flexible member 123 , thereby securing the arm in place. It will be appreciated that positioning the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 may require little or no movement of the patient. The patient&#39;s arm may need to be lifted, but the patient&#39;s body does not need to be lifted from the support surface 115 to position the arm in the space. This reduces the risk of injury to the patient, who may be unconscious, heavily sedated, or otherwise unable to voluntarily move, and to medical personnel who would otherwise need to lift the patient. It also reduces the need to have multiple medical personnel lift and move the patient or the need to use equipment, for example a lift, to move the patient. It increases the speed of securing the arm of the patient and further allows the arm to be quickly released to provide rapid access to the arm in an emergency. Moreover, in some embodiments the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 extend to an upper surface of the circumference of the arm, which advantageously positions the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 on top of the arm, increasing the visibility of the interface between the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113. This further facilitates uncoupling the second flexible member 123 from the first flexible member 113 because the arm and the patient do not need to be moved to uncouple the members and because medical personnel can easily see where to grasp the second flexible member 123 and the first flexible member 113 to uncouple them. This improves access to the arm of the patient, for example to attach a medical device to the arm (such as an IV, a sensor, a bandage, etc.), to perform a medical procedure on the arm, or to release the arm. It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments the first flexible member 113 may be selectively decoupled from the second flexible member 123 along a portion of the interface between the members. This may allow medical personnel to access a portion of the arm while permitting the arm to be supported and protected by the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123. For example, medical personnel may decouple the first flexible member 113 from the second flexible member 123 adjacent to the forearm to attach an IV to the patient while leaving the first flexible member 113 coupled to the second flexible member 123 along the rest of the length of the arm (including the upper arm and wrist, for example), thereby holding the arm in place and protecting the enclosed portion of the arm while the IV is attached. Medical personal may adjust the location where they decouple the first flexible member 113 and the second flexible member 123 to access the arm in order to account for differences in arm lengths.

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/978,754, filed on Oct. 9, 2007, entitled \u201cMAGNETIC ANASTOMOSIS DEVICE HAVING IMPROVED DELIVERY\u201d FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to magnetic anastomosis devices for forming an anastomosis between two viscera. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Magnetic anastomosis devices (MADs) are currently used to create a channel between two viscera for the purpose of redirecting bodily fluids. For example, intestinal contents or bile may be redirected in patients who have developed an obstruction of the bowel or bile duct due to such conditions as tumor, ulcer, inflammatory strictures or trauma. With reference to FIG. 1 , the relative positions of several organs of the abdominal cavity are shown, including the gall bladder 10 , the common bile duct 12 , the stomach 14 , the duodenum 16 and the jejunum 18 of the small intestine. Inflammatory strictures 20 , 22 of the jejunum 18 and bowel duct 12 are shown by the dotted lines in FIG. 1. [0004] A magnetic anastomosis device (MAD) 30 has been depicted in FIG. 2 , the details of which may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,656, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generally, the MAD 30 includes first and second magnet assemblies 30 a, 30 b comprising magnetic cores 36 a, 36 b which are surrounded by thin metal rims 38 a, 38 b. Due to the magnetic attraction between the two magnetic cores 36 a, 36 b, the walls 32 , 34 of two adjacent viscera may be sandwiched and compressed between the magnet assemblies 30 a , 30 b, resulting in ischemic necrosis of the walls 32 , 34 to produce an anastamosis between the two viscera. With reference back to FIG. 1 , the two viscera may comprise the jejunum 18 and the stomach 14 , the bowel duct 12 and the duodenum 16 , or various other combinations. [0005] Historically, MADs have been delivered through surgical intervention such as laparotomy, which of course is invasive and carries its own risks. The exemplary self-centering MAD of U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,656 permit delivery of the device over a wire guide and through the oral cavity, and typically under fluoroscopy. Alternatively, delivery can be accomplished by simply swallowing the magnet assemblies of the MAD and using massage under fluoroscopy to center the two magnet assemblies. Finally, delivery of the magnet assemblies has occasionally been performed endoscopically with grasping forceps, which can be time consuming and difficult. Removal of the MAD is typically accomplished allowing the magnet assemblies to pass through the gastrointestinal track naturally, or more typically with a follow-up endoscopic procedure using grasping forceps. Unfortunately, the relatively large size of the magnet assemblies can make delivery and retrieval complicated. In fact, balloon dilation of bodily lumens is often required in order to deliver the magnet assemblies to the desired location. Likewise, the size of bodily lumens is often the limiting factor in the size of the magnet assemblies that can be delivered and deployed. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention provides a magnet assembly for a magnetic anastamosis device that is minimally invasive, easily and quickly delivered, and is accurately positioned to improve the delivery procedure. According to one embodiment constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a magnet assembly for a magnetic anastamosis device includes an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. The elongated hub is formed of a shape memory material, permitting the magnet assembly to be operable between a delivery configuration and a deployed configuration. In the delivery configuration, the elongated hub extends generally linearly, and in the deployed configuration the elongated hub forms an annular shape. In this manner, the package width of the magnet assembly is greatly reduced for delivery, thereby permitting delivery over a wire guide as well as through an access device such as a catheter. [0007] According to more detailed aspects, the elongated hub is formed of a nickel titanium alloy. The elongated hub is preferably tubular and defines an inner passageway sized to receive the wire guide. The plurality of magnetic members may abut each other in the deployed configuration. Each of the plurality of magnetic members includes a hole sized to receive the elongated hub, and each hole may be sized to permit the magnetic member to slide along the elongated hub, or may be sized to provide a friction fit. In the former case, the elongated hub includes a stop formed at one end of the elongated hub to prevent the plurality of magnetic members from passing beyond the end. Alternatively, the plurality of magnetic members and elongated hub may include corresponding tabs and detents or other means for maintaining the position of the magnetic members on the elongated hub. In one form, the plurality of magnetic members each include a jacket attached to a side thereof, each jacket projecting beyond the sides to define an edge. Each edge may contact the edges of adjacent jackets to form a continuous annular \u201ccutting\u201d edge in the deployed configuration. [0008] Another embodiment constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention provides a medical device for forming an anastamosis between two bodily walls, the medical device comprising a magnet assembly and an access device. The magnet assembly has an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. The access device is structured to be coupled to the magnet assembly. The magnet assembly is biased to a deployed configuration defined by the elongated hub and plurality of magnetic members forming an annular shape. When the magnet assembly is coupled to the access device, the magnet assembly assumes a delivery configuration defined by the elongated hub and plurality of members having a generally linear configuration. According to more detailed aspects, the elongated hub is formed of a resilient material biased to the deployed configuration. Alternatively, the elongated hub is formed of a shaped memory material which takes the deployed configuration when the elongated hub is exposed to body temperature. [0009] A method of delivering a magnet assembly that is part of a magnetic anastamosis device is also provided in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. A magnet assembly is provided having an elongated hub and a plurality of magnetic members disposed over the elongated hub. An access device is introduced to a position proximate a first bodily wall. The magnet assembly is coupled to the access device such that the magnet assembly assumes a delivery configuration having a generally linear shape.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025] Turning now to the figures, FIG. 3 depicts a single magnet assembly 40 for a magnetic anastomosis device that is used to form an anastomosis between two viscera. The magnet assembly 40 generally comprises an elongated hub 42 and a plurality of magnetic members 44 disposed over the elongated hub 42. The deployed configuration of the magnet assembly 40 is depicted in FIG. 3 , wherein the elongated hub 42 and the plurality of magnetic members 44 form an annular shape having an interior space 43. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the magnet assembly 40 may be used in conjunction with another magnet assembly of larger or smaller size to form the magnetic anastamosis device (i.e. similar to that depicted in FIG. 2.) To improve delivery of the magnet assembly 40 , the magnet assembly is operable to a delivery configuration as depicted in FIG. 6. In the delivery configuration, the magnet assembly 40 has a reduced width, making it easier to pass through bodily lumens. [0026] To achieve the delivery and deployed configurations of the magnet assembly 40 , the elongated hub 42 is structured to transition between a linear condition as depicted in FIG. 4 and an annular condition such as the circular shape depicted in FIG. 5. As such, the elongated hub 42 may be constructed of a resilient material which is biased to the annular condition depicted in FIG. 5 but may be flexed and straightened into the linear condition depicted in FIG. 4. Suitable resilient materials include metals (e.g. stainless steel), alloys (e.g. nickel-titanium) or polymers (e.g. polyethylene, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) including Teflon\u00ae, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)), and composites. Alternatively, the elongated hub 42 may be formed of a shape memory material such as nickel-titanium alloys (Nitinol), copper-aluminum-nickel, copper-zinc-aluminum, and iron-manganese-silicon alloys. That is, the shape memory material of the elongated hub 42 is structured to take the linear condition of FIG. 4 at a first temperature, and moves into the annular condition of FIG. 5 at a second temperature. The second temperature preferably corresponds to body temperature of the patient, or above body temperature but below tissue harming temperature, so that one can freely maneuver the device inside the body, and then inject a hot fluid over the device to trigger the shape memory. It will be recognized that the linear condition of the elongated hub 42 corresponds with the delivery configuration of the magnet assembly 40 ( FIG. 6 ) while the annular condition of the elongated hub 42 corresponds to the deployed configuration of the magnet assembly 40 ( FIG. 3 ). [0027] As best seen in FIG. 4 , the elongated hub 42 is preferably formed as a tube 46 defining an interior passageway 48 which is sized to receive an access device such as a wire guide 50. For example, the wire guide 50 may be used to maintain the linear condition of the elongated hub 42 when it is constructed of a resilient material that is biased to the annular condition ( FIG. 5 ). In either construction of the elongated hub 42 (i.e. biased or shape memory), the ability to couple the elongated hub 46 and magnet assembly 40 to a wire guide 50 is useful in navigating the magnet assembly 40 to the desired location for forming the anastomosis. For example, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the wire guide 50 may include radiopaque markers permitting tracking of the distal tip of the wire guide 50 such that the delivery point of the magnet assembly 40 may be readily and easily monitored by the physician under fluoroscopy. [0028] Turning to FIG. 6 , it will be recognized that an alternate access device such as a catheter or cannula 54 may be used to maintain the magnet assembly 40 in its delivery configuration, while also providing access to the desired location within the viscera on which the procedure will be formed. The cannula 54 defines an interior space 55 receiving the magnet assembly 40 therein. A pusher 56 may be used to translate the magnet assembly 40 within the cannula 54 or simply to maintain its position therein. As with the wire guide 50 , the cannula 54 may include radiopaque markers 57 permitting tracking of the access device under feroscopy for accurate positioning of the magnet assembly 40. It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that the cannula 54 may be used alone or in conjunction with a wire guide 50 for navigation of the bodily lumens and delivery of the magnet assembly 40. [0029] As also seen in FIG. 6 , the plurality of magnetic members 44 are axially spaced along the elongated hub 42. In particular, each magnetic member 44 is located on the exterior of the elongated hub 42 and includes a hole 52 sized to receive the elongated hub 42. Turning to FIG. 7 , a few of the numerous ways in which the magnetic members 44 may be coupled to the elongated hub 42 have been depicted. By way of example, magnetic member 44 a includes a hole 52 a which is sized larger than an outer diameter of the elongated hub 42 and thus is axially translatable therealong. The magnetic member 44 b has been shown as soldered to the elongated hub 42 , although numerous related means such as welding or adhesives may also be employed. The magnetic member 44 c includes a protective coating 58 which may be formed of various materials such as polymers like Teflon\u00ae or Paralene\u00ae for protection of the magnetic core from the corrosive effects of digestive acids or other bodily fluids depending upon the body structure involved. It will also be recognized that the magnetic member 44 c depicts a friction fit with the elongated hub 42 , which may be employed regardless of whether the coating 58 is used. Finally, magnetic member 44 d depicts a corresponding detent 60 and tab 62 which may be formed on the hub 42 and magnetic member 44 d. [0030] The magnet assembly 40 as depicted in FIGS. 3-7 has a general ring or disc shape (i.e. having an axial height which is less than the outer diameter of the magnetic member 44 ) which may be circular, oval or ovoid, square or the like, and it will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that the magnetic members 44 may take numerous sizes and shapes, a few of which have been depicted in FIGS. 8-12. The magnetic member 44 e of FIG. 8 has been depicted as generally cubular. The magnetic member 44 f of FIG. 9 has been depicted as generally cylindrical. The magnetic member 44 g of FIG. 10 has been depicted as polygonal and specifically hexagonal, while also being elongated. The magnetic member 44 h of FIG. 11 has been depicted as a generally trapezoidal body, the trapezoidal shape existing in a plane generally parallel to the elongated hub 42. The trapezoidal shape is denoted by a radially inner side 64 which is smaller in length than a larger radially outer side 66. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the trapezoidal shape of magnetic member 44 h, as well as related wedge or pie shapes, has particular usefulness when a continuous upper or lower surface of the magnet assembly 40 is desired. That is, the angled side surfaces 65 will abut adjacent side surfaces 65 of the neighboring magnetic members 44 h. As such, the angling of side surface 65 and the relative sizes of opposing surfaces 64 , 66 may be selected depending upon the number of magnetic members 44 h and the radius of the annular deployed configuration ( FIG. 3 ). Finally, the magnetic member 44 i of FIG. 12 is formed as an oblong bead. Numerous other shapes of the magnetic members 44 may be readily envisioned by those skilled in the art. [0031] As shown in FIGS. 13 , 14 and 15 , each magnetic member 44 may be designed to have its magnetic north and south poles divided by virtually any plane. For example, in FIG. 13 the north portion 70 and south portion 72 of the magnetic member 44 has been separated along a transverse plane (indicated by dotted line), generally perpendicular to the axis of the elongated hub 42. In FIG. 14 , each magnetic member 44 has its north portion 74 and south portion 76 divided along an annular plane (indicated by dotted line), generally parallel to the axis of the elongated hub 42. It will also be recognized that in the embodiment of FIG. 14 , when the magnetic members 44 are permitted to slide axially over the elongated hub 42 , a stop 68 may be formed at the ends of the elongated hub 42 to keep the magnetic members 44 disposed over the elongated hub 42.

  "negative": "Developments in food processing have identified challenges in enhancing the texture and stability of tomato-based products, notably in the context of maintaining the viscosity of sauces. It has been found that the preparation of tomato sauces, utilizing chunks or purees, encounters an issue with viscosity management. Specifically, when the tomato tissues are disrupted, there is a tendency for viscosity to diminish, impacting the overall quality of the sauce. Innovations in this field have delved into exploring natural ingredients and their interactions, addressing how these can stabilize the textural integrity of the sauces without resorting to high-temperature treatments that might compromise the flavor profile. It is recognized that certain types of molecules derived from the tomato itself play a crucial role in this process. Investigations have revealed that these molecules interact with minerals naturally present in tomatoes, leading to a stabilization of the sauce\u2019s consistency. The process also benefits from utilizing low-heat techniques, which preserve the freshness and taste of the tomatoes. Furthermore, the procedure allows for the inclusion of other plant-based materials that contribute to the flavor complexity and texture of the final product. The sauces that undergo this optimized process exhibit a fresh appeal and are characterized by a consistency that is ideal for culinary applications. Moreover, the resulting product can be packaged and stored for considerable periods without losing its quality attributes. The innovation signifies a step forward in the field of sauce production, offering a method that ensures the flavor and texture of the sauce remain at their peak while being convenient for commercial production and shelf storage.\n\n",
  "pos": "This is a continuation application of Ser. No. 08/511,429, filed Aug. 4, 1995 now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tomatoes have recently received attention as a healthful food, particularly in view of the carotenoids which they contain. Popular sources of tomatoes in the diet are spaghetti and other red pasta sauces. Many consumers prefer tomato sauces which are freshly prepared because of improved taste. However, a difficulty encountered in the commercial preparation of fresh sauces is that breaking or cutting of tomatoes, eg, during dicing or crushing, especially breaking or cutting the tomato skins, causes the release of enzymes which can result in a rapid and usually undesirable decrease in the viscosity of the product. Consequently, heating to elevated temperatures is used to deactivate these enzymes, with the resulting loss of taste found in processed, as opposed to fresh packed, sauces. Using fresh tomato products in preparing a tomato sauce (particularly calcium-treated raw diced tomatoes) can result in the sauce gelling. This is a result of the pectin and pectin-related enzymes not being deactivated in the raw tomatoes by heat. Pectin exudes from the raw tomatoes and combines with the available calcium to form a calcium pectate gel. It is usual in the practice of making a spaghetti sauce to use canned or aseptically processed diced tomatoes. The heat processing of the diced tomatoes inactivates the pectin enzymes and sets the pectin in the diced tomatoes. But again, heat processing generally has an impact on taste. Generally, the best diced tomatoes are made using calcium chloride to firm the dices prior to processing. The calcium treated diced tomatoes can be a source of calcium for the gelling formation, although most tomato products contain enough calcium for gel formation to occur even without an additional source of calcium. The source of pectin is the unprocessed diced tomatoes. Pectin can also come from any fresh puree used in making the sauce although the main source of the excess pectin related to the gel has been identified as coming from the raw diced tomatoes. Two enzymes which have been implicated in the above are pectin methyl esterase, which catalyzes cleavage of methoxy groups from pectin, and pectinase (also known as polygalacturonase or PG) which catalyzes depolymerization of the cleaved pectin molecules, which causes the reduction in viscosity. It is the demethoxylated pectins which are most suseptible to forming gels by combining with calcium ions. Pectinase is sometimes used to degrade soluble and insoluble pectins with varying degrees of esterification for viscosity reduction, clarification, and depectinization and maceration of plant tissue in the production of fruit and vegetable juices. It is known that pectin will be deactivated by depolymerization by a small amount of pectinase. It is documented that raw garlic and onion will under specified process conditions cause a tomato product (i.e., a sauce) to gel. U.S. Pat. No. 4,547,375, to Mersfelder et al. addresses how to prevent these gels and/or use these types of gels to thicken tomato based products. Mersfelder et al. disclose using the gelation mechanism provided by releasing methyl pectin esterase from onion and garlic to demethoxylate the pectin available in the tomato based product to generate a supply of low methoxyl pectin to increase the viscosity of the sauce. They also disclose that in sauces wherein the tomatoes were initially heat treated to inactivate the enzymes, gelling can be prevented by, e.g., a) heating the onion or garlic prior to their addition to the sauce or b) the addition of pectinase. Crandal et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,047 recognized that high rapid heat treatment of pectin-containing juices will prevent gelling. Crandal et al. were confronted with the fact that the product they wanted to make could not tolerate a high heat manufacturing process without losing its product benefit. Their solution was to subject their product to high shear to destroy or prevent the gel. Unfortunately, high shear tends to destroy the appearance of distinct diced tomatoes in a sauce. Moreover, to subject a fresh pack tomato based sauce to sufficient heat in a short enough time to prevent some of the gelation would produce a product that lacked the flavor and texture benefits derived from making the product at lower temperatures, but results in the product having an undesirable texture because of the gel. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have found that even when fresh garlic and onion have been treated to prevent the release of pectin methyl pecterase and thereby prevent them from causing gelling in the tomato products, gels still occur in the fresh pack spaghetti sauces containing previously non-heat processed raw diced tomatoes. Raw diced tomatoes treated with calcium chloride to insure their firmness during the sauce processing are particularly susceptible to such gelling. The invention is directed to a process for producing a fresh pack tomato based sauce, preferably with portions of raw diced tomatoes, fresh garlic and fresh onion, and having a fresh taste and a desirable viscosity without the undesirable gelling. In accordance with the invention, a fresh pack tomato sauce is made using cut or broken tomatoes, eg tomato dices, pieces, purees or pastes, by adding the broken tomatoes to a vessel and also, either before or after the addition of the broken tomatoes, adding pectinase. Preferably, the broken tomatoes are in the form of raw diced tomatoes (with or without added calcium for firming). Desirably, fresh onion, and fresh garlic are also added. The broken tomatoes, eg raw diced tomatoes, and preferably also the fresh onion and garlic, are added without gelling by adding a pectinase enzyme to the vessel prior to adding the diced tomatoes, fresh garlic, and fresh onion. At least a portion of the broken tomatoes is not heat treated to deactivate pectin-related enzymes. Preferably, substantially none of the diced tomatoes are heat treated to deactivate pectin-related enzymes. The preferred method of enzyme addition is to add the pectinase to water and the optional calcium salt such as calcium chloride in the kettle, then to add the raw tomatoes for a short period of time (usually 1 to 5 minutes) and then to add a puree of fresh tomatoes and the rest of the sauce ingredients. The sauce can be held for periods of half to one hour, preferably at about 110\u00b0 F. without causing an undesirable gel to form in the finished sauce or a loss of viscosity. The effective amount of the enzyme ranges from 0.01% to about 1% of the total weight of the sauce. It is desirable that the addition of pectinase to the sauce be effected under controlled conditions. It has unexpectedly been found that the gel was completely and consistently eliminated in the fresh pack tomato sauce with added raw diced tomatoes, fresh garlic, and fresh onion, yet the viscosity of the sauce was good. This finding was especially surprising in view of the fact that pectinase is used to decrease viscosity and is implicated in the decrease in viscosity which often results naturally once a tomato has been cut if the product is not soon heated to a high enough temperature to deactivate the enzyme. Thus, use of pectinase according to the invention permits the sauce to have a fresh taste by rendering unnecessary the usual enzyme-deactivation (and taste impairing) heat treatment, while at the same time permitting the sauce to maintain a desirable viscosity and texture. Although sterilization prior to packing is usually necessary, heat processing can be kept to a minimum in making the sauce commercially sterile. It was surprising that one could add pectinase to a sauce that was depending on the properties of pectin for its viscosity since it was expected that adding a pectinase to the sauce would adversely affect the viscosity of the sauce. While not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the use of pectinase in the present invention limits the pectin/calcium interaction so that the original viscosity of the puree is maintained, but the pectin being added to the sauce by the raw tomatoes does not gel. The pectinase is not being used to destroy the tomato tissue of the diced tomatoes. Thus, pectinase is being used in conjunction with a low heat process to stabilize tomato sauce viscosity and tomato dice integrity instead of its common use to destroy either viscosity and/or plant tissue. The sauce is aseptically processed and is packed in glass or cans and is shelf stable at room temperature for extended periods of time. If desired, mixtures of enzymes may be used including, In addition to pectinase, enzymes such as cellulase or hemicelilulase. For purposes of the invention, heat deactivation of pectin enzymes is considered to occur at temperatures of 180\u00b0 F. or more. In order to preserve the fresh taste of the product, it is especially preferred that no tomato ingredients be used which have been previously heated, ie, heated outside of the immediate sauce preparation procedure. For a more complete understanding of the above and other features and advantages of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and to the accompanying drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The tomatoes used in the invention are preferably freshly picked. Pectinase, also known as PG or polygalacturonase, is available under the brand name Pectinase AT from Solvay Enzymes of Elkhart, Ind. Pectinase AT has an activity of 150,000 ADJU/gram. ADJU&#39;s are apple depectinase juice units. Another enzyme which may be used is sold as Clarex L, also by Solvay, and has an activity of 15,000 ADJU/ml. Clarex ML is a pectinase having a pectinase activity of 40,000 ADJU, which also contains hemicellulase and cellulase enzymes. The Clarex ML product should be used in the present invention at approximately four times the amount of the Pectinase AT enzyme. The activities ratio of pectinase to cellulase in the Clarex ML product is 10:1 whereas the activities ratio of pectinase to hemicellulase in the Clarex ML product is 1:4. The ratio of activities for hemicellulase to cellulase in Clarex ML is 40:1. The pectinase activity in the enzyme preparation may, for example be within the range of from 35,000 to 150,000 ADJU/gram. from eg Pectinase may be obtained from Quest, International as Biopectinase. Pectinase may also be obtained from Novo Nordisk of New York, N.Y. The pectinase may be fungal or from plants such as tomatoes and other fruits or vegetables. Fungal pectinase is preferred. Pectinase is used at a level of from 0.005 to 0.2 weight percent of the final sauce. The amount of pectinase used may be adjusted based on the ambient temperature which the tomatoes experience prior to dicing since higher temperatures can increase pectinase activity. If it is desired to use a freshly prepared tomato puree in preparing the sauce, in addition to diced or other broken tomatoes, it may be desirable to heat the puree prior to addition to the vessel. If desired, this may be conducted at temperatures high enough to deactivate enzymes, without departing from the present invention since the diced tomatoes will still contain active enzymes which induce the problematic gel formation to which the present invention provides a solution. Preferably at least 10 wt % (based on the weight of the final sauce product) and more preferably from 20-45 wt. % of tomatoes in the sauce are subjected to temperatures which do not exceed 180\u00b0 F., preferably 170\u00b0 F., especially 150\u00b0 F. prior to sterilization. Commercial sterilization is desirably carried out by heating at between 195 and 200\u00b0 F. for about 10-20 minutes. For instance, the sauce can be heated at 195\u00b0 F. for 10 minutes, at 200\u00b0 F. for 5 minutes or at 185\u00b0 F. for 15 minutes. Desirably, the exposure of the sauce to high temperatures is minimized to preserve the fresh taste. The amount of diced tomato preferably ranges from 10 to 40 wt % based on the weight of the final sauce. Tomato puree may be used at from 5 to 45 wt % basis final sauce, e.g., 30-45 wt. %. Water will typically be added at from 10-45 wt %. Spaghetti sauces often include one or more vegetable oils. Typical examples of appropriate vegetable oils include corn oil, olive oil, canola oil and soybean oil, although almost any vegetable oil can be used. The oil may be used at from 0 to 15 wt. %, especially from 0.5 to 12 wt. %. and more narrowly from 2 to 9 wt. %. However, the sauce may also be free of added triglyceride oil or fat. If triglycerides are present it is preferred that they be in the form of vegetable oil rather than animal fat. Sauces prepared in accordance with the invention will desirably have a Bostwick viscosity of from 5 to 7 cm, especially from 5.5 to 6.5 cm, most preferably 6 cm. The Bostwick viscosity may be determined as follows. The sauce is placed in a viscometer instrument called a Bostwick Consistometer. The Bostwick Consistometer must be at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.) and be clean and dry. It must be leveled. A small carpenter&#39;s level works well. The puree or paste is diluted to 12 brix and mixed until there are no visible lumps of tomato puree and/or paste. The chamber is filled full. The excess material is scraped off of the top of the chamber with a straight edge. Release the gate and time for 30 seconds. Record the distance the tomato puree/paste has traveled in cm. The sauce will move to a distance corresponding to its viscosity; the higher the viscosity, the less distance the paste will move. The Bostwick number is obtained by measuring the distance as calibrated on the instrument. The soluble solids of the sauce will typically range from 10 to 16, preferably from 12 to 15 brix. The pH of the sauce may be adjusted as desired using edible acids including citric, malic, lactic, acetic or gluconic acids. If necessary, the pH may be buffered using a buffer system such as citric acid/sodium citrate, gluconic acid/sodium gluconate, acetic acid/sodium acetate, or malic acid/sodium malate systems. The pH of the sauce of the invention may range from about 4 to about 6, especially from 4 to 5. In addition to Alluvium vegetables such as onion and garlic, other ingredients which may be used in the sauce include table salt, sweeteners such as sucrose, pepper and garlic and onion powders. If desired, the Alluvium ingredients may be blanched, eg heated at a temperature of above 160 \u00b0F. prior to addition to the tomato ingredients of the product. Seasonings and spices may include pepper, such as black pepper and red pepper, basil, dry basil, oregano, thyme, bell pepper, celery, bay leaf, fennel and parsley. Chopped vegetables, such as green and red peppers and carrots, and meats, such as ground beef, may be included, if desired. The sauce of the invention is typically prepared by adding freshly diced tomatoes to a kettle to which has already been added water, firming salts and pectinase. Desirably, the diced tomatoes are treated as early as possible in the process with the firming salts. A fresh puree which has a soluble solids content of about 20 brix is then added. The puree is preferably at 20 brix, eg from 15 to 25 brix rather than the more typical 32 brix, so as to be subjected to less heat during the evaporation process. However, 31 or 32 brix paste could also be used. The puree will preferably have been subjected to a break temperature of approximately 200\u00b0 F. for 5 to 10 minutes. The sauce is held for an hour at from room temperature up to 110\u00b0 F. or another appropriate temperature after which the sauce is sterilized and packed. Preferably, the sauce is subjected to commercial sterilization conditions which are less severe, to enhance fresh taste. The order of addition of ingredients may be varied, so long as the viscosity is not undesirably diminished. For instance, the diced tomatoes can be added to the firming salt and water and mixed, after which pectinase can be added and mixed, after which the puree, spices and remainder of ingredients can be added. Alternatively, the pectinase can be added immediately after the puree. The diced tomatoes are exposed to firming salts to preserve their viscosity. Calcium chloride is a preferred firming salt. Another preferred firming salt is calcium citrate. Others include mono calcium phosphate and calcium lactate. Calcium chloride is used in an amount not to exceed 0.222 wt % of the sauce, preferably from 0.095 wt % to 0.222 wt %. To ascertain whether a sauce is to be considered gelled, i.e., to possess an undesirable gel, gel strength assessment is determined by a visual analysis of the cooled product in a jar. A gelled product retains the shape of the jar and pulls away cleanly from the side of the jar when tipped or rotated. The product surfaces appear shiny on gelled products. A non-gelled product appears uniformly pulpy and not shiny. A visual assessment of the jarred product is made individually by one or more, preferably more than one, especially four, people familiar with identifying gelling in tomato based products. The scale used is a six point scale adopted from gel assessments made by Crandal et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,047. They refer to a Gel Evaluation test by Redd et. al.&#34;Quality Control Manual for Citrus Processing Plants.&#34; (1986 Intercit, Inc.). The Crandal et al. and Redd et al. references are incorporated herein by reference. The scale is as follows: 0=Product of uniform appearance, contains no gel lumps. 1=Product with a few small gel lumps but no tendency to mound. 2=Product contains some gelled lumps with a slight tendency to mound. 3=Product has a definite degree of gelation with a slight tendency to mound but does not retain the shape of the container. 4=Product is over 75% gelled with a definite retention of the shape of the container. 5=Product is 100% gelled with the product retaining the fine detailed shape of the container."

  "negative": "The proposed imaging technique concentrates on refining the motion synchronization between an organ's periodic movement and an x-ray acquisition device's rotation. While prior methods have utilized a constant rotation speed, resulting in data unusable for reconstruction due to organ motion during non-rest phases, our invention provides a dynamic solution. Through a controlled variation of rotation speeds in coordination with the organ's cycle, the challenge of achieving an optimal ratio of useful image data to motion-induced data gaps is addressed. This synchronization allows for capturing finer details during the organ's period of least motion, thereby enhancing the quality of the resultant 3D imagery. The method is effective for multiple projection angles and is particularly valuable for imaging heartbeat-related organ movements, providing improvements in the precision and reliability of medical diagnosis without increasing overall radiation exposure to the patient.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention concerns a method and an apparatus to image an organ of the human or animal body, particularly for imaging a beating heart via a rotating acquisition device. In modem medicine, manifold minimally-invasive methods to image an organ are known, such as x-ray methods. It is the goal of these methods to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of the respective organ and its state primarily without opening the body. In a known application, for example, a C-arm of an x-ray apparatus with an x-ray tube and an x-ray detector is rotated around a patent, normally around the patient longitudinal axis, with a constant rotation speed or angular velocity w over an angle of, for example, 300 degrees. Instead of an only platform view through a catheter with camera, etc., with such imaging methods and a corresponding apparatus, a number of individual exposures of the appertaining organs can be acquired from various spatial directions, on whose basis three-dimensional images or other representations (such as, in particular, arbitrary cross-sections) can ultimately be produced. With these methods, for example, the heart muscle and the coronary artery can be examined without a catheter. However, for a 3D reconstruction, only those images can be used that show the organ in a respectively constant state. In a preferred and most important application case, the exposure of the heart, the filling phase or diastole, as a relative rest phase of the heart, is selected as a representation state. In a living human and in a rest position given relaxation, this rest phase lasts less than 200 milliseconds. During the acquisition, however, only a few projections for the 3D reconstruction and modeling can be collected by the moving acquisition device in a time window \u0394t in the rest phase of the heart cited above. The respective data collected outside of the acquisition time window \u0394t cannot be used for imaging due to the heart movement. These data losses lead to large gaps in the space of the projection angle \u03b1, and therewith to an incomplete representation basis of the entire organ. At best, interpolations with relatively uncertain assumptions can be effected within these representation gaps. A similar problem also occurs with other organs whose shape and/or positions change over time. However, for reasons of keeping low a total radiation exposure with an x-ray tube continuously located in operation, the acquisition device may not exhibit an arbitrarily slow rotation speed in order to acquire optimally many exposures from different spatial directions at advantageous acquisition moments. For the same reasons, a measurement can also not be repeated arbitrarily often. For this reason, U.S. Pat. No. 6,324,254 discloses the acquisition of a rhythmically moving vessel to in fact move the C-arm with an optimally slow rotation speed, preferably &gt;2\u00b0 per second to thereby implement individual image acquisitions triggered by the vessel movement or an organ movement causing the movement of the vessel. This means radiation is only respectively emitted by the x-ray tube and an exposure made at specific times while the C-arm moves around the patent with an optimally slow, constant speed. The constant rotation speed is hereby preferably established before the measurement dependent on the frequency of the rhythmic vessel or organ movement in order to ensure that a minimum number of exposures can be generated during a measurement. However, this procedure has the disadvantage that the measurement lasts a relatively long time. In this time, the patent must lie absolutely still. Even minimal position changes can lead to impaired measurement. A similar method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,217 for measuring a periodically moving subject with a computer tomograph. Given a measurement with such a computer tomography system, the x-ray tube rotates multiple times around the patient with a very high speed, for example, with a speed in the range of approximately 1 s/rotation. In order to thereby always acquire the cyclically changing subject in the same state, here as well when the x-ray tube momentarily emits x-ray radiation, the imaging is controlled to be triggered by the movement cycle in order to thus make individual exposures. Likewise, a constant rotation speed is hereby preferably determined before the measurement dependent on the frequency of the rhythmic vessel or organ movement. The rotation speed is thereby adjusted such that exposures are optimally generated from all spatial directions during a measurement This method Is, however, not usable for a measurement with a C-arm or similar acquisition device, since in such a relatively simple acquisition device, the x-ray tube and the detector can not be moved arbitrarily fast and often around the patient (this is different than in a significantly more elaborately constructed computer tomography apparatus). Typically, only a rotation angle of maximally 300\u00b0 is available. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus to the effect that a ratio of angle gaps to usable angular intervals is provided in order to increase the reliability and precision of the entire measurement. This object is inventively achieved via a method of the previously cited type in which the rotation speed of the rotating acquisition device is modulated dependent on a reference signal that represents a current movement state of the organ to be imaged. Via the appropriate modulation of the rotation speed, the rotation movement can be adapted to the changes of the position and/or shape of the organ to be acquired, and thus the acquisition can be optimized. The modulation thereby advantageously ensues such that the ratio of useable angular intervals to angle gaps is increased. The angular coverage is optimally dense with \u201cvalid\u201d (meaning usable) image data around the examined body. An apparatus to implement this acquisition method comprises an acquisition device that is positioned such that it can rotate around the body by at least one angle and an appropriate actuator in order to pan the acquisition device with a predetermined rotation speed around the body during a measurement Moreover, this apparatus comprises a measurement device to determine a suitable reference signal which represents a current movement state of the organ to be imaged and a control device connected with the actuation unit which correspondingly modulates the rotation speed of the rotating acquisition device dependent on the reference signal. Various embodiments of the method and apparatus are discussed below. Various embodiments of the method can particularly be used on the previously cited C-arm acquisition devices, which comprise a C-arm suspended such that it can be rotated around the body, having at one C-end an x-ray source and at the other end an x-ray detector opposite the x-ray source. However, in principle the method can also be used with other similar acquisition devices. This method is particularly well-suited when the movement of the organ to be acquired moves periodically, such as the heart rhythm in heart exposures. Given a periodic movement of the organ, the modulation of the rotation speed likewise preferably ensues periodically. A \u201cmodulation of the rotation speed\u201d is also defined as including every other movement, for example, also a periodic deviation from a constant movement. In the theoretically simplest case, the rotation could be entirely stopped at specific points in time, for example, between the rest phases of the organ. Due to the weight or moment of inertia of the acquisition device, however, in most cases this can only technically be realized with great effort. Therefore, the modulation preferably ensues such that the acquisition device alternately rotates faster and slower. The faster rotation with a first angular velocity occurs during the measurement or exposure intervals \u0394t. The slower rotation occurs with a second angular velocity between two successive measurement intervals. Depending on a specific application case, different signals can be drawn upon as reference signals. In the preferred case of monitoring and imaging a heart and/or one of its vessels, an EKG signal of the patient is preferably evaluated. Alternatively or additionally, the pulse of the patient and/or ultrasound signals, etc. can also be used. It is particularly advantageous when the measurement interval with the useable exposures of the organ is adapted to the cycle duration of a periodic movement of the organ to be imaged, for example, given a heart acquisition adapted to the heart period length T rr. The cycle duration can, for example, preferably also be determined in a sliding/floating manner beforehand over a certain number of movement cycles. The length of the measurement interval can, for example, be specified in percentages of the cycle duration. If, using the reference signal, it is established that the cycle duration changes during the acquisition, a synchronous adaptation of the measurement interval can ensue. Such an adaptation (by way of a reference signal) of the measurement interval to the cycle duration of a movement of the organ to be imaged is also advantageously independent of the modulation of the rotation speed of the acquisition device in order to increase the ratio of usable angular intervals to angular gaps, and can therefore also be viewed as an independent embodiment of the present invention. Further advantageous embodiments are discussed below. The transition region between the phases of different rotation speeds are preferably designed with different acceleration curves or braking curves dependent on the capability of the electromechanical control. These transitions are designed continuous and preferably sinusoidal according to an embodiment of the invention. Naturally, differently designed transition curves can also be used. For example, in one embodiment, under a requirement of a temporal interval, the transition curves are formed with the aid of energy-optimized functions, for example, using cubic splines. Provided with the respective boundary values, the regulation parameters are determined by a computer in real time. T rr , \u0394t, \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 and possible further quantities are determined by the computer according to one or more of the above specifications. These quantities are subsequently transferred to a control unit of the acquisition device as regulation specifications. A deactivation of x-ray radiation, or at least a reduction of the emitted radiation to an optimally low intensity or dose is advantageously provided outside of the measurement intervals. An effective reduction of the total radiation exposure for the patient is also achieved with only one pass of the apparatus according to an embodiment of the inventive method. In a further embodiment of the invention, the user may retrospectively displace the measurement intervals on the time axis in a later evaluation of the acquired data in order to compensate for stronger oscillations of the heart rate or arrhythmias. This measure is inasmuch reasonable since normally all image data determined during the measurement in a pass is cached anyways, such that they are in every case available for a post-processing. If necessary, even such data that were acquired outside of the actual predetermined \u201cvalid\u201d measurement intervals \u0394t are thus present for post-processing. In this case, an automatic adaptation of the appertaining angular intervals \u0394\u03b1 ensues according to the known control curves. The inventive control device or its components can preferably largely be realized in the form of software in a processor or a conventional computer-aided control of the acquisition device. In this manner, it is possible to also upgrade the method described above in the form of a computer program product, particularly an update in existing apparatuses. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is explained in detail in the following using an exemplary embodiment, with reference to attached Figures. FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram representation of an exemplary embodiment of an inventive imaging apparatus; FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating a curve of the angle dependent on the time given constant angular velocity according to the prior art; FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating an ideal angle-time curve; FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating a real angle-time curve; and FIG. 5 is a graph showing a detail enlargement of a section of the diagram according to FIG. 4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In a schematic representation, FIG. 1 shows an imaging examination apparatus 1 in which an x-ray tube 2 is rotated on a \u201cC-arm\u201d 3 , together with a surface detector 4 arranged oppositely on the C-arm 3 , at an angle \u03b1 around the body 5 of a patient to be examined. The patient is positioned on a patient positioning table 6. The rotation of the C-arm 3 ensues around the longitudinal body axis of the patient The surface detector 4 can, for example, be an image intensifier or a planar detector (FPD). During a movement \u03b1(t) of the C-arm 3 around the body 5 of the patient to be examined, x-ray exposures are acquired from different spatial directions. With this examination lasting only 10 to 15 s, internal organs of the patient can be reproduced as a three-dimensional model. As the most important application case, an embodiment of exclusively a heart examination is discussed in the following, without limitation of the use of the inventive method and/or the use of the inventive apparatus. Rotation of the C-arm 3 is provided with a motorized actuation unit 7. This is controlled by a control unit 8 under evaluation and preparation of a reference signal 9 that reproduces the movement state of the heart to be acquired here. The reference signal 9 is determined by a measurement device 10 , here a typical EKG detector. The detailed design of the apparatus 1 and its components is discussed below following a representation of a principle course of the method for 3D modeling and particular problems. If the x-ray tube 2 and the surface detector 4 are moved on the C-arm 3 with a constant rotation speed or angular velocity \u03c9 around the body 5 of the patient, only a few projections can be collected for a 3D reconstruction in a time window \u0394t in the rest phase of the heart the filling phase or diastole. The images acquired outside of the time window \u0394t and other data 11 can not be used for imaging due to the heart movement This principle selection leads to large gaps in the space of the projection angle \u03b1. This becomes apparent in a concrete numerical example: Given the typical constant angular velocity w according to the prior art, the connection between projection angle \u03b1(t) and time t is given by the function: \u03b1( t )=\u03b1 0 +\u03c9\u00b7t, where \u03b1 0 is the initial value at a point in time t=0. This connection and the relation of the heart movement (represented by a reference signal taken from the patent in the form of an EKG signal 9 ) are shown in FIG. 2. An angular velocity \u03c9=30 degrees/s results for an overall rotation angle of \u03b1 max =300 degrees and a total rotation or acquisition time of T=10. Given a time resolution typically necessary for the heart imaging, the usable measurement interval for the acquisitions lies in the range of \u0394t&lt;200 ms. An angular interval \u0394\u03b1 of usable projections of \u0394\u03b1=\u03c9\u00b7\u0394 t= 30 degrees/s\u00b70.2 s=6 thereby results. Given a heart rate 1/T rr of 60 bpm (heartbeats per minute), the length T rr of a heartbeat period, which is here defined as a time between successive r-spikes of an EKG, is here precisely one second, thus T rr =1 s. This means that the C-arm 3 rotates further for a time of T rr \u2212\u0394t=0.8 s, and data are acquired that are in principle not usable for the imaging due to the pumping motion of the heart In the space of the projection angle, this means a gap \u0394\u03b1 L of \u0394\u03b1 L =0.8 s\u00b730 degrees/s=24 degrees The ratio R of the usable angular intervals \u0394\u03b1 to the angular gaps \u0394\u03b1 L is consequently very unfavorable. In the present example, R is: R = \u0394\u03b1 \u0394\u03b1 L = 25 \u2062 % In other words, only a fourth of the available spatial directions in the scan plane is used to achieve an optimally reliable basis for a modeling of the heart to be imaged. For an ideal acquisition of usable data, the angular gaps should be virtually non-existent. The ratio R would therewith be arbitrarily large. As long as the C-arm 3 is rotated with constant angular velocity, however, the ratio R is independent of the rotation speed. The rotation speed is therefore modulated during the rotation around the patient such that R is increased. The angular coverage is therewith optimally dense with \u201cvalid\u201d or usable data. An ideal case would then be achieved when the rotation between two measurement intervals \u0394t is interrupted into successive heartbeats. The curve of the projection angle as a function of time shown in FIG. 3 results. Since \u03b1 L is zero, R is infinitely large, and therewith the angular coverage with \u201cvalid\u201d data is absolute. However, the arrangement that can be moved over the C-arm 3 comprises a non-negligible mass. For reasonable delimitation of the technical or electromechanical effort for the actuation unit 7 of the C-arm 3 , for a practical realization, it is significantly more appropriate to not completely interrupt the rotation. Rather, for the movement, a modulation between an alternately faster and slower rotation is selected. The rotation thereby ensues faster with a first angular velocity \u03c9 1 during the measurement intervals \u0394t and slower between two successive measurement intervals with a second angular velocity \u03c9 2. The transition range can be designed with various acceleration curves or braking curves depending on the capacity of the electromechanical control and the actuation unit 7. A possible angle-time diagram is shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 5 shows an enlarged section of FIG. 4. The dashed curves represent the ideal curve according to FIG. 3 ; the solid lines represent a curve according to FIG. 4 that can be realized relatively simply. It is then true for the angle ratio: \u0394\u03b1 = \u2062 \u03c9 1 \u00b7 \u0394 \u2062 \u2062 t \u0394\u03b1 L = \u2062 \u03c9 2 \u00b7 ( T RR - \u0394 \u2062 \u2062 t ) R = \u2062 \u03c9 1 \u00b7 \u0394 \u2062 \u2062 t \u03c9 2 \u00b7 ( T RR - \u0394 \u2062 \u2062 t ) = \u03c9 1 \u03c9 2 \u00b7 1 ( T RR \u0394 \u2062 \u2062 t - 1 ) In the following two limit cases, R is infinitely large: a) \u03c9 2 =0, i.e.,"

  "negative": "The invention under discussion pertains to a composition intended for topical administration, specifically formulated as an ocular solution, which utilizes a novel viscosity agent to enhance patient compliance. The enhanced viscosity helps in prolonging the contact time of the medication with the ocular surface, thereby increasing its therapeutic efficacy. This composition could potentially be beneficial for various ophthalmic conditions that require sustained medication application. The main component is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which works by reducing inflammation and pain in ocular tissues. The composition is infused with a viscosity agent, chosen from a group that includes natural and synthetic polymers, which facilitates a controlled release mechanism and ensures stability of the drug within the solution. The NSAID is typically included in concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.3% (w/v), combined with a suitable buffering agent to maintain a physiological pH range, and may optionally contain a preservative to prevent microbial contamination. This medication, however, does not contain any sweetness modifiers or flavor masks since the intention is not to combat bitterness, which is not a characteristic concern for ocular solutions, as opposed to nasal formulations. Moreover, the invention does not impose any unpleasant aftertaste due to the mode of delivery avoiding the oral cavity.\n\n",
  "pos": "[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/888,926, filed Feb. 8, 2007; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] This invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations, particularly aqueous nasal preparations, of an antihistamine compound, such as epinastine hydrochloride and related compounds. This invention also relates to methods of treating allergic rhinitis by intranasal delivery of a small volume of a viscous epinastine formulation, whereby the patient perceives a minimal or no bitter taste of epinastine. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Epinastine, chemically known as 3-amino-9,13b-dihydro-1H-dibenz-[c,-f]imidazol[1,5-a]azepine, and its acid addition salts are disclosed in German Patent application P 30 08 944.2 which forms the basis for EP 0035749. Methods for the preparation of epinastine are described in EP 0496306 or WO 01/40229. Epinastine is most often used for its antihistaminic effects. [0004] Epinastine hydrochloride (ELASTAT\u00ae) has been approved as an eye drop in U.S. for treating allergic conjunctivitis. Epinastine hydrochloride has been approved as an oral tablet in Japan and some South American countries for treating allergic rhinitis. However, especially for children and elderly people, tablets are not always easy to take. It is found that aqueous formulations of epinastine-hydrochloride result in bad taste, reported as bitterness or bitter aftertaste. The bitter taste of epinastine is strong and could not be masked by the use of a single conventional taste-masking agent such as sucrose. [0005] ASTELIN\u00ae (0.1% azelastine hydrochloride) nasal spray was approved for treating allergic rhinitis in the United States. When ASTELIN\u00ae was administered to subjects at 137 \u03bcL per spray, two sprays per nostril, twice daily, 19.7% of subjects reported adverse effects of bitter taste (see product package insert of ASTELIN\u00ae nasal spray). [0006] US2003/0104017 discloses a pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, and at least two kinds of sweeteners or flavoring agents, wherein one of the at least two kinds of sweeteners or flavoring agents masks the quick-acting bitterness of epinastine or its salt and the other one masks the long-acting bitterness of epinastine or its salt. [0007] WO2004/075900 discloses pharmaceutical powder formulation comprising epinastine, sodium lauryl sulfate, sweetening agents and/or flavoring agents. [0008] US2003/0050303 discloses a method for inhibiting the influx of neutrophils and eosinophils into the tissue of the ocular conjunctiva or the nasal mucous membrane in a host, the method comprising topically administering to a host in need of such treatment an aqueous solution comprising epinastine, optionally in the form of its racemate, its enantiomers, or its pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, in a concentration of 0.005 to 0.5 mg/ml of solution. [0009] US2002/037297 discloses a process for the topical treatment of or prophylaxis against allergic rhinitis, vasomotoric rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cold, cold-like and/or flu symptoms. The method comprises topically administering to mucous tissues of a patient in need therefor a non-sedating antihistamine and an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist. [0010] US2006/0110331 discloses a composition comprising azelastine, hypromellose as a viscosity modifier and sucralose as a taste-masking agent. [0011] Currently, there is not an effective method for treating allergic rhinitis with an aqueous intranasal spray formulation without causing strong and unpleasant bitter taste associated with post-nasal drip. There is a need for an improved aqueous nasal spray formulation for treating allergic rhinitis; such aqueous nasal spray formulation is not only effective to treat allergic rhinitis but also has an acceptable taste profile following repeated dosing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0012] The present invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a viscosity-enhancing agent. The viscosity-enhancing agent provides an enhanced viscosity of the formulation without causing precipitation of the active ingredient epinastine or other ingredients. The increased viscosity of the formulation minimizes post-nasal drip and reduces the possibility of the formulation to \u2018drip back\u2019 from the nasal cavity to the back of the throat. By minimizing the postnasal drip, the bitter taste of epinastine is less perceived by the subject. The viscosity-enhancing agent is a polymer selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvivnyl pyrrolidone, and the combination thereof. [0013] The aqueous pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention typically comprises 0.05-0.2% (w/v) epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, 0.05-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent, a buffer to maintain a pH between 5-8, and a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG. [0014] The present invention also provides a method for treating allergic rhinitis in a subject. The method comprises the steps of: identifying a subject suffering from allergic rhinitis; administering to the nose of the subject one to two sprays at \u2266115 \u03bcL per nostril per spray once or twice daily of an aqueous epinastine formulation; wherein said aqueous epinastine formulation comprises (a) 0.05-0.2% (w/v) of epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, (b) 0.05-0.5% (w/v) of a viscosity-enhancing agent selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the combination thereof, to maintain the viscosity between 1.5-10 centipoise, and (c) a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG; whereby the subject perceives a minimal or no bitter taste of said epinastine and the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are reduced. A preferred viscosity-enhancing agent is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. A preferred tonicy agent is propylene glycol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0015] The inventor has unexpectedly discovered an aqueous epinastine formulation that can be delivered topically for use in the nose or in the eye and has a minimal or no bitter taste. The aqueous epinastine formulation is viscous and has a viscosity of 1.5-10 centipoises. When intranasally delievered in a small volume of \u2266120 \u03bcL, preferably \u2266115 \u03bcL, preferably \u2266100 \u03bcL, preferably \u226690 \u03bcL, more preferably \u226685 \u03bcL per nostril per spray, the epinastine formulation of the present invention is effective in treating allergic rhinitis, and does not cause a strong bitter aftertaste, even without including taste-masking agents such as sweeteners or flavoring agents in the formulation. Although the nose has a large space relative to the spray volume emitted by a small volume metered-dose nasal spray pump, the inventor has unexpectedly discovered that reducing the nasal spray volume from 137 \u03bcL (ASTELIN\u00ae nasal spray volume) to \u2266115 \u03bcL, preferably to &lt;85 \u03bcL, plays an important role in minimizing the bitter aftertaste of epinastine. The inventor has discovered that delivering a small volume of the viscous epinastine formulation of the present invention reduces the bitter aftertaste significantly without compromising the therapeutic efficacy of epinastine. The viscous epinastine formulation is delivered to the nose of a patient using a metered-dose nasal spray pump. The viscous epinastine formulation has minimal post-nasal drip and does not cause an unacceptable quick-acting bitterness or a long-acting bitterness after dosing. [0016] This invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antihistamine chemical compound such as epinastine and salts thereof. This invention provides a formulation containing one or more viscosity-enhancing agents that increase the viscosity of the formulation and minimize the bitter taste of epinastine. The formulation does not contain a substantial amount of unacceptable agents for pharmaceutical, particularly, ophthalmic and nasal use. The invention provides a stable aqueous formulation of epinastine; the formulation is suitable for therapeutic uses and remains stable under normal use storage conditions for an extended period of time. [0017] The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention exclude the use of inappropriate adjuvants that can cause toxicological outcomes and tissue damage when used in humans or mammals for a long term. The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention contain epinastine in solution at sufficient concentrations, and provide an anti-allergic response in mammals. The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations are non-irritating and tolerable to human epithelial cells, and are suitable for multiple instillations. [0018] The present invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or a salt thereof, and a viscosity-enhancing agent. Epinastine can be used either as free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Preferably, epinastine is used in the form of its acid addition salts such as hydrochloride salt. [0019] \u201cA viscosity-enhancing agent,\u201d as used herein, refers to a compound when added to a solution increases the viscosity of the solution. A viscosity-enhancing agent at a suitable concentration can modify or alter the flow properties of the system from a Newtonian fashion (e.g. water) to a pseudo plastic or plastic flow. An increased viscosity alters the residence time, drainage characteristics, and/or bioavailability of the pharmaceutical formulation. A viscosity-enhancing agent typically increases the viscosity of the pharmaceutical formulation 1.5-10 fold (e.g. 1.5-10 centipoises) with respect to water (approximately 1 centipoise). [0020] The viscosity-enhancing agent used in the formulation provides an enhanced viscosity of the formulation without causing precipitation of the active ingredient epinastine or other ingredients. Furthermore, the viscosity-enhancing agent is compatible with other agents in the formulation. The increased viscosity of the formulation provides a sustained action, minimizes post-nasal drip, and reduces the possibility of the formulation to \u2018drip back\u2019 from the nasal cavity to the back of the throat. By minimizing the postnasal drip, the bitter taste of epinastine is less perceived by the subject. [0021] A viscosity-enhancing agent useful for the present invention is often a polymer such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvivnyl pyrrolidone. A preferred viscosity-enhancing agent is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The viscosity-enhancing agent often improves the physical stability of the formulation. The inventor has discovered that not all typical pharmaceutically acceptable viscosity modifiers are suitable for use in this invention because they are physically incompatible with epinastine in solution and result in flocculation and phase separation, and/or they do not function well at pH 4-8. For example, polyvinyl acrylic acid, polystyrene sulfonic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose are not suitable for this invention. [0022] Typically, the aqueous pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 0.001-3% (w/v) epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, 0.001-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent, a buffer to maintain a pH between 4-8, and a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG. The viscosity of the formulation is about 1.5-10 centipoises (cps), preferably 1.5-10 cps, more preferably 2-9 cps, and more preferably 2-6 cps. [0023] The concentration of epinastine in the aqueous formulation is in general 0.001-3%, preferably 0.005-1% or 0.005-0.6%, and more preferably 0.05-0.2% or 0.1-0.15% (w/v). For example, a preferred concentration of epinastine is about 0.1% or about 0.15%. [0024] As used in this application, \u201cabout\u201d refers to \u00b115% of the value recited. [0025] The concentration of a viscosity-enhancing agent in the aqueous formulation is in general 0.001-5%, preferably 0.05-0.5%, and more preferably 0.1-0.3% (w/v). [0026] The pH of the present formulation is 4-8, preferably 5-8, more preferably 6.0-7.5. Buffers suitable to maintain the pH between 4-8 include phosphate, citrate buffer, acetate buffer, maleate buffer, tartarate buffer, or combination thereof. Phosphate buffer or citrate buffer is preferred. For long-term stability, the formulation is preferred to have a pH of 5-8. Buffers suitable to maintain the pH of 5-8 include citrate buffer, phosphate buffer, citrate/phosphate buffer, maleate buffer, tartarate buffer, or combination thereof. A suitable concentration of the buffer is 1-100 mM, preferably 5-50 mM, more preferably 5-25 mM, and most preferably 10-20 mM. [0027] The tonicity agent is present in an amount to achieve a tonicity between 200-400, preferably 220-380, and more preferably 250-340 mOsm/kG. The tonicity agent can be non-ionic or ionic. A non-ionic tonicity agent is preferred because its compatibility with polymeric adjuvant that functions as a viscosity-enhancing agent. Non-ionic tonicity agents include diols, such as glycerol, mannitol, erythritol; and sugars such as sucrose and dextrose. Other non-ionic tonicity agents such as glycerol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, which also function as cosolvents and taste-masking agent, can also be used. The non-ionic tonicity agent is in general in an amount of 1-20%, preferably 1-10%, more preferably 1-5%. Preferred non-ionic agents are mannitol, sucrose, dextrose, propylene glycol, in an amount of 1-5%. For Example, propylene glycol at 1-2% or 1-1.8% (w/v) is a preferred non-ionic tonicity agent for the present invention. [0028] The tonicity agent can also be ionic agents such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or a balanced salt solution. The ionic tonicity agents are typically present in an amount of 0.5-0.9%, preferably 0.6-0.9%. [0029] The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises a chelating agent. A chelating agent is a substance which can form several coordinate bonds to a metal ion. Chelating agents offers a wide range of sequestrants to control metal ions in aqueous systems. By forming stable water-soluble complexes with multivalent metal ions, chelating agents prevent undesired interaction by blocking normal reactivity of metal ions. Ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and N,N-bis(carboxymethyl)glycine (NTA) are examples of chelating agents for the present inventions. EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) is a preferred chelating agent. The chelating agents are typically present in an amount of 0.01-1%, and preferably 0.02-0.5% w/v. [0030] Health regulations in various countries require that multi-dose ophthalmic and nasal preparations include a preservative. The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises a preservative. Many well known preservatives that have been used in some other nasal and ophthalmic preparations cannot be used in the present invention, since those preservatives are not considered safe for repeatedly ocular use, or they interact with the viscosity-enhancing agent employed herein to form a complex that reduces the bactericidal activity of the preservative. Suitable preservatives for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, methyl parabens, propyl parabens, and benzethonium chlorides. In one embodiment, benzalkonium chloride is included as a safe preservative; preferably, benzalkonium chloride is used with EDTA. Typically, preservatives are employed at a level of 0.001-1%, preferably, 0.005-0.25%, and most preferably 0.05-0.2% (w/v). [0031] The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises one or more taste-masking agents to mask the bitter taste of epinastine. Taste-masking agents can be sweeteners, flavoring agents, or other agents that can mask the taste of a formulation. Taste-masking agents suitable for the present invention include saccharin sodium, erythritol, aspartame, sucrose, glycerin, sorbitol, glycyrrhinic acid, or glycyrrihinate ammonium salts. A good taste-masking agent is glycyrrihinate ammonium salts. Commercially available SWEETAM\u2122 flavor (Flavors of North America), which contains monoammonium glycyrrihinate salts pre-blended with suitable adjuvants such as sucrose and dextrose, is also suitable to be included in the present formulation. A taste-masking agent at a level of 0.001-0.5% (w/v) can be included in the fonnulation. However, the inventor has discovered that the aqueous epinastine formulation of the present invention does not cause bitter aftertaste even without including a taste-masking agent such as sweeteners or flavoring agents. [0032] The viscosity-enhancing agent, the tonicity agent, the buffer, the taste-masking agent, and any other ingredient introduced in the formulation must have a good solubility in water, have compatibility with other components, and have mild effects on the final viscosity of the formulation. This viscosity of the formulation is important such that the formulation can be delivered as a topical nasal spray using a metered-dose nasal spray device and is filter-sterilizable. The formulation is preferably a clear solution without any precipitate. [0033] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises epinastine or its salts in an amount of 0.05-0.2% (w/v), a non-ionic tonicity agent such as propylene glycol at 1.0-1.8% (w/v), a buffer (such as sodium phosphates) at 10-25 mM, a viscosity-enhancing agent in a range of 0.05-0.5% (w/v), an optional chelating agent in a range of 0.02-0.5% (w/v), and an optional preservative in a range of 0.005-0.2% (w/v). Such an aqueous composition has a tonicity of 250-350 mOsm/kG and is formulated at pH 5-8. [0034] In another embodiment, an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprises epinastine or its salts in an amount of 0.001-3% (w/v), 1-100 mM buffer suitable to maintain the pH between 5-8, 0.001-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent to maintain a viscosity of 1.5-10 cps, a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG, and a taste-masking agent at a level of 0.001-5% w/v. The formulation optionally comprises a preservative (such as benzalkonium chloride) at a level of 0.005-0.2% w/v. [0035] The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are preferably stable at room temperature for at least 12 months, preferably 24 months, and more preferably 36 months. Stable, as used herein, means that epinastine maintains at least 80%, preferably 85%, 90%, or 95% of its initial activity. [0036] The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention can be prepared by aseptic technique or are terminally sterilized. The purity levels of all materials used in the preparation exceed 90%. The solutions of the invention are prepared by thoroughly mixing the epinastine or salts thereof, buffer(s), tonicity agent(s), viscosity-enhancing agent(s), optionally, taste-masking agent(s), chelating agent(s), complexing agent(s), solubilizing agent(s), preservative(s) and antioxidant agent(s). Examples of complexing agents are cyclodextrins, gamma-cyclodextrin, and crosspovidone. Examples of solubilizing agents are polysorbates, crernophor, and glycerin. Examples of antioxidants are tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoulene, butylated hydroxyanisole. Complexing agents, solubilizing agents, antioxidants can be added to the formulation; however, they are not essential for the formulation of the present invention. [0037] The pharmaceutical formulation can be sterilized by filtering the formulation through a sterilizing grade filter, preferably of a 0.1 micron nominal pore size. The pharmaceutical formulation can also be sterilized by terminally sterilization using one or more sterilization techniques including but not limited to a thermal process, or a radiation sterilization process, or using pulsed light to produce a sterile formulation. [0038] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is administered locally to the eye (e.g., topically, intracamerally, or via an implant) in the form of ophthalmic preparations. The pharmaceutical formulation can be combined with additional ophthalmologically acceptable viscosity enhancers, or penetration enhancers to form an ophthalmic suspension or solution. The pharmaceutical formulation is ready for use, without further dilution or any other manipulation. The pharmaceutical formulation can be administered to the eyes of a patient topically by any suitable means, but is preferably administered in the form of drops, spray or gel. For topical ophthalmic administration, one to two drops of the formulation are delivered to the surface of the eye one to three times per day according to the routine discretion of a skilled clinician."

  "query": "What is the advantage of the novel investigative X-ray apparatus design with permanently offset beam axis?,",
  "negative": "The innovative X-ray system described comprises an emitter of X-ray radiation forming a directed beam along a key axis, a restricting collimator for the beam's scope, and a bidimensional sensor, all mounted on a framework that can pivot around a central axis. The collimator has a primary configuration directing the shaped beam towards the central axis and a secondary setup where the beam is displaced from the central axis, with the bidimensional sensor adjusted to match. The beam's central axis is situated at a minor distance from the central axis compared to the collimated beam when in the second setup. By having an oblique X-ray source orientation compared to the central axis, the system leverages the full potential of the X-ray source. This X-ray source does not align with the usual isocentre. Moreover, the X-ray source and the collimator assembly are not in congruence, ensuring better utilization of the source's field. Due to the edge effects within the X-ray source, a smaller field is required, allowing for more variety in selecting suitable tube designs and optimizing the performance of the X-ray tube across different parameters. Visuals and schematics illustrate a conventional machine's operations both in standard and modified configurations, as well as the coverage provided by each method. Other system components, including an anode, voltage source, and filament, are also described, highlighting the need for effective heat management. By exploiting the entire spectral field of the X-ray tube, designers are free from the constraint of choosing a tube based on its field width, enabling other optimizations.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a Section 371 National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT/GB2005/002894, filed 25 Jul. 2005 and published as WO 2006/013325 on 9 Feb. 2006, in English. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to X-ray apparatus, in particular X-ray apparatus that has an investigative function. Such X-ray apparatus can be stand-alone X-ray apparatus, for purely investigative purposes, or can be integrated as part of an investigative function provided on a radiotherapeutic apparatus. BACKGROUND ART Computed Tomography scanning is a well known diagnostic technique and, in Its cone beam form, involves directing a wide beam of X-rays towards and through the patient and capturing the resulting two-dimensional image on a flat panel detector behind the patient. The apparatus (source and detector) is then rotated around the patient to obtain a multiplicity of images from different directions. These images are combined via a suitable computing means in order to produce a three-dimensional representation of the internal structure of the patient. One limiting factor is the cost and size of the detector. Flat panel X-ray detectors are typically very expensive, and the cost increases with the dimensions of the detector. In practice this places an upper limit on the possible size of the flat panel detector. This in turn places a limit on the maximum aperture of the apparatus. There are ways to increase the effective aperture of the device, within limits. Normally, the cone beam is directed along a central beam axis that coincides with the isocentre of the device, and the flat panel detector is centred on that beam axis. This will mean that each successive image taken by the flat panel detector will show a section of the patient centred on the isocentre. These can then be reconstructed in the normal way. However, for particularly large patients this aperture may be insufficient. In this case, the aperture of the apparatus can be increased by moving the flat panel detector such that the central beam axis intersects near to one edge of the detector. This X-ray beam can then be collimated differently so that the cone beam is offset from the (previous) central beam axis and still covers the area of the flat panel detector. The beam will then be centred on an offset beam axis. In this case, each individual image will only show half of the relevant portion of the patient. However, after the apparatus has rotated through 180\u00b0, the other half will be brought into the image. When these images are reconstructed using a suitably reconstructed algorithm, a complete rendering of the patient will still be possible, albeit with a lower resolution reflecting the fact that each voxel of the reconstructed volume has been reconstructed using only half the amount of data. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Whilst this arrangement is potentially beneficial in that it allows a different compromise to be reached between aperture and image quality in cases that demand it, it does place some limitations on the apparatus design. In particular, the X-ray tube must be able to provide a beam that is of twice the width otherwise required. This limits the choice and specification of X-ray tubes that can be used and may impose difficulties in other areas, in that a tube that is able to provide a sufficiently wide beam may be inadequate in other ways. The present invention therefore provides an investigative X-ray apparatus, comprising a source of X-rays emitting a cone beam centred on a beam axis, a collimator to limit the extent of the beam, and a two-dimensional detector, the apparatus being mounted on a support which is rotatable about a rotation axis, the collimator having a first state in which the collimated beam is directed towards the rotation axis and the second state in which the collimated beam is offset from the rotation axis, the two-dimensional detector being movable accordingly, the beam axis being offset from the rotation axis by a lesser amount than the collimated beam in the second state. Thus, in effect, the X-ray source is given a permanent offset of a few degrees (such as 3-4\u00b0) such that its natural axis is halfway between the two extremes called for by the collimator. The X-ray source is no longer directed towards the isocentre as would normally be the case. Thus, in an alternative aspect, the present invention provides an investigative X-ray apparatus comprising an X-ray source and a collimator set in which the beam is not orthogonal to the collimators. This is advantageous in that the entire field of the X-ray tube can be utilised. X-ray tubes typically have edge effects such as tube heel, and this can be kept away from both potential images. As a result, a lesser field is required of the X-ray tube and the choice of tube designs and capacities can be widened so as to optimise the performance of the X-ray tube in other aspects. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying figures in which; FIGS. 1 and 2 show a conventional machine in normal and offset states, respectively; FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate diagrammatically the field coverage of the normal and offset states, respectively; FIG. 5 shows the apparatus according to the present invention in a first collimation; FIG. 6 shows the apparatus of FIG. 5 in a second collimation; FIG. 7 shows the apparatus of FIG. 5 in a third collimation; FIG. 8 shows a typical anode for investigative X-ray apparatus; and FIG. 9 shows the X-ray tube schematically. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a typical radiotherapy machine. This has a rotatable support 10 on which is mounted a therapeutic X-ray source 12 which is able to produce a collimated beam of high energy X-rays 14 centred on a therapeutic beam axis 16. Also mounted on the rotatable support 10 is an investigative X-ray source 18 , which produces a beam of low-energy X-rays 20 along an investigative beam axis 22. On the opposite side of the support 10 , a flat panel detector 24 is positioned so as to intersect with the investigative beam axis 22. The rotatable support 10 is arranged to rotate about an axis which passes through the coincidence of the therapeutic beam axis 16 and the investigative beam axis 22 , and which is orthogonal to both axes. In this case, the therapeutic beam axis and the investigative beam axis are orthogonal to each other, but this is not essential and other designs are possible. The point of coincidence of the two beam axis 16 , 22 and the rotation axis of the support 10 is referred to as the \u201cisocentre\u201d. A patient table 26 is located slightly below the isocentre, and a patient 28 resting on the patient table will therefore just lie at the isocentre of the apparatus. In practice, the patient table 26 is made so as to be moveable, to allow the patient to be positioned relative to the isocentre, and permit the treatment of tumours at a variety of bodily locations. During treatment, the therapeutic X-ray source 12 is activated and the beam 14 is collimated so as to match the shape of the tumour. The rotatable support 10 can be used to rotate the therapeutic X-ray source 12 around the patient so as to direct the beam 14 towards the patient from a variety of directions. Provided that the tumour is at or near the isocentre, it will always be Irradiated. However, the use of a variety of irradiation directions is one factor in reducing the dosage given to healthy tissue whilst maximising the dosage given to the tumour. It is of course essential to ensure that the patient is correctly positioned prior to treatment. To do so, the investigative X-ray source 18 is activated and the low energy beam 20 is passed through the patient and, after attenuation by the patient, is detected by the flat panel detector 24. This produces a two-dimensional projection image of the patient. The rotatable support 10 is then used to rotate the investigative X-ray source 18 and the flat panel detector 24 around the patient thereby producing a collection of projected images showing the patient from every variety of directions. These can be reconstructed using known algorithms to produce a three-dimensional image of the patients adhering structure, the process known as computed tomography or CT scanning. This internal image of the patient can be used as a final check that the patient is in the correct position, and potentially, as a source of feedback to allow fine adjustment of the position of the patient table 26. In FIG. 1 , the investigative beam 20 is shown collimated so that the image it projects covers the entire working surface of the flat panel detector 24. As a result, the width of the beam 20 at the patient 28 is large enough to ensure that the whole of the patient 28 is included in the image obtained by the flat panel detector 24. Problems can arise in the case of very large patients, part of whom will lie outside the beam 20. In general, it is not possible simply to select a larger flat panel detector 24 and allow a wider beam, since the flat panel detector 24 is a high value item and larger examples cannot be procured at economic cost. Accordingly, larger patients are dealt with as shown in FIG. 2. The same flat panel detector 24 is moved on its support to an offset position, as shown. Whilst the flat panel detector 24 still coincides with the investigative beam axis 22 , that axis 22 now crosses the flat panel detector 24 near one edge of the detector 24. The investigative beam 20 is now collimated slightly differently so that it is no longer centred on the investigative axis 22 but extends from that axis 22 and to one side. As a result, the beam 20 produces an image of approximately one half of the patient 28 , in this case the half lying above the isocentre. However, as the apparatus is rotated around the patient 28 , after a total rotation of 180\u00b0 the image will show the area of the patient below the isocentre. FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate the point schematically. In FIG. 3 , the solid vertical line 30 shows the section of the patient which is being viewed at the start of the rotation process. This is represented as a line, whereas the images are of course projected images rather than a section, but FIG. 3 illustrates the principle only. As the apparatus rotates, the effective image moves through an angle to the dotted line 32 , and as rotation continues further the images moves to the dotted line 34. Thus, as rotation continues, the image taken of the patient maps out a cylindrical volume centred on the axis of rotation. FIG. 4 illustrates the offset method. A solid line 36 of identical length to the solid line 30 is again rotated, but this time the axis of rotation is at one end of the solid line 36. Thus, as the image rotates through 38 and 40 etc., a larger cylinder is mapped out. This caters for the larger patient. However, it can be seen that twice as many lines are required to map out the same cylindrical volume. Thus, the offset rotation arrangement must either spend twice as long gathering images in order to produce the same quality CT reconstruction, or must accept a lower quality CT reconstruction deriving from fewer images. This choice is however clinically useful. FIG. 5 shows an improved apparatus for use in this type of diagnosis. This comprises, in general, an X-ray generating source 50 and a collimator set 52. The investigative beam axis 22 is shown, together with the isocentre 54 and the flat panel detector 24. The X-ray source 50 , which we will described in more detail later, produces a beam 56 which is then collimated in the collimator 52. In this design of collimator set 52 , a number of slots 58 , 60 are provided to receive collimators and filters as required. The first slot 58 contains a beam collimator 62 to produce the investigative beam 20 from the output beam 56 of the source 50 , so that the beam 20 just covers the flat panel detector 24. In this case, as shown, the beam collimator 62 collimates the beam 56 evenly, by reducing its width equally on both sides. As shown in FIG. 5 , the collimator 52 is aligned with the beam axis 22 and the isocentre 54. However, the X-ray source 50 is offset by an angle 66 from being perfectly orthogonal to the investigative beam axis 220. As a result, the X-ray source 50 and the collimator 52 are not in alignment, and the approximate centre 68 of the beam does not coincide with the isocentre 54. However, the beam does extend across the beam axis 22 and the isocentre 58 is included within the extent of the beam 20. FIG. 6 shows the same apparatus in which an alternative beam collimator 62 \u2032 has been fitted, together with an alternative filter 64 \u2032. The second filter 64 \u2032 differs only in that its centre is suitably offset. The alternative beam collimator 62 \u2032 differs in that it collimates the beam asymmetrically with respect to the beam 56 emanating from the X-ray source 50 , but nevertheless symmetrically about the beam axis 22 and the isocentre 54. In this way, the apparatus can be used as described with respect to FIG. 1. FIG. 7 shows the same apparatus with a still further alternative collimator 62 \u2033 and filter 64 \u2033. In this case, the collimator 62 \u2033 collimates the beam 56 asymmetrically, but this time in the opposite sense to that of FIG. 6. Instead of returning the beam towards the isocentre 54 , the beam is offset still further from the isocentre 54 such that the beam 20 only just overlaps with the isocentre 54. This produces an offset beam for use in the manner as described with respect to FIG. 2 above. It will be appreciated that the two extremities of collimation that are required in clinical practice, as shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 respectively, now occupy the extremities of the usable area of the beam. The fullest available extent 56 of the beam is therefore used, by virtue of the angle 66 between the X-ray source 50 and the collimator set 52. This relieves the designer of the need to select an X-ray tube on the basis of its wide available field, and allows the optimisation of the X-ray tube based on other requirements of the device. FIG. 8 shows, for information, a typical target 70 for use in an X-ray source 50. FIG. 9 shows the apparatus, schematically, including the target 70. A high voltage source 72 , typically providing 150 kV is arranged to produce a potential between a hot filament 74 and the anode 70. The anode 70 is itself mounted on a spindle 76 which is rotatable by a motor 78. Thus, a beam of electrons 80 travels from the filament 74 towards the anode 70. The anode 70 has a molybdenum core 82 with a generally circular face on which is mounted an annular ring 84 of tungsten/rhenium target material. The apparatus is disposed such that the electron beam 80 lands on the anode at the target material 84. The surface is slightly bevelled so that, in respect of the surface, the electron beam 80 arrives at an angle and, as a result, an emitted beam of X-rays 86 departs the anode 70 in a direction which is roughly perpendicular to the incoming electron beam 80. This beam 86 is then collimated by suitable beam stops 88 to produce the output beam 56 of the X-ray source. The motor 78 drives the anode 70 via the spindle 76 so that the annular target 84 is constantly rotating. As a result, the point of contact of the incoming electron beam 80 is constantly moving across the anode although the rotationally symmetric design of the anode 70 means that this does not affect the output beam 56. As a result, the anode 70 is better able to cool notwithstanding the energy absorbed from the electron beam 80. The entire apparatus of FIG. 9 is typically enclosed within a suitable vacuum flask, which is itself suspended in a bath of flowing oil so as to assist in heat removal. It will be appreciate from FIGS. 8 and 9 that it is only possible to widen the output beam 56 within limits. The width of the output beam 56 will in practice be limited by the size of the rotating anode 70 and by the geometry of the apparatus, for example of the direction of the electron beam 80 , the degree to which the target surface 84 is bevelled, and the dimensions of the target surface 84. Limitations such as the need to rotate the anode 70 and the requirement that the anode be adequately cooled mean that there are limits to the available width of the beam 56. Beyond those available limits, the X-ray Intensity becomes less uniform as it eventually fades away to nothing, a phenomenon known as \u201ctube heel\u201d. Accordingly, the invention as described with respect to FIGS. 5 , 6 and 7 allows the available extent of the X-ray beam to be used more efficiently, thereby relaxing the design requirements placed on this aspect of the X-ray tube and allowing it to be optimised in other respects."

The technology discussed pertains to an advanced cycle time vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) nitrogen generator unit and corresponding procedures for the execution of these units using a specific range of cycle times, coupled with selected adsorbents of precise dimensions. The nitrogen generator unit and its methods have significant implications in sectors including biotechnology, engineering, and geology. One key application for this technology is as a compact nitrogen generator for stationary industrial usage or transportable applications without relying on bulky apparatuses like a dedicated blower or compression systems typically required for a conventional VSA nitrogen generator. \n\nNitrogen is frequently utilized for various industrial and preservation activities. For instance, there is a broad demand for nitrogen in food packaging to avoid oxidation. Predominantly, nitrogen has been supplied by bottled or liquefied nitrogen tanks. Nonetheless, there has been a shift toward on-site VSA nitrogen generation systems for direct use. Some known nitrogen generators include: [Generic Patent References with descriptions]. These technologies aim to minimize generator size while still generating adequate nitrogen purity levels for industrial applications from atmospheric air.\n\nA prevailing challenge for nitrogen generator designers is to diminish the adsorber volume while maintaining the required nitrogen production rates.

  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the priority of U.S. 61/173,352, filed on Apr. 28, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein reference. FIELD This application describes a rapid cycle pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen concentrator apparatus and related methods for operating the apparatus utilizing a range of preferred cycle times, which was not previously identified, in conjunction with selected adsorbents of preferred specifications. The oxygen concentrator apparatus and methods herein have significant utility in the fields of biotechnology, engineering, and medicine. A particularly advantageous use of this invention is as a \u201csnap on\u201d portable oxygen concentrator where piped compressed air is available such as in civil and military hospitals, ambulances, air craft cabins, mobile fish tanks, etc., thus eliminating the need for a dedicated moving machine (blower, compressor, vacuum pump) normally associated with a conventional PSA oxygen concentrator. BACKGROUND Oxygen is commonly administered to living organisms, and in particular, humans, for medical and survival purposes. For example, a significant population of humans require administration of supplemental oxygen to alleviate respiratory disorders, such as COPD. Such supplemental oxygen is traditionally supplied by compressed or liquid oxygen cylinders. However, more recently, in situ PSA medical oxygen concentrators for individual use have been developed, and are being used in such environments as residential homes and during travel for mobile applications. Some examples of known concentrators are described in: U.S. Pat. No. 7,121,276 B2 to Jagger et al. (2006) for \u201cPersonal Oxygen Concentrator\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,384 B1 to Ackley and Zhong (2003) for \u201cMedical Oxygen Concentrator\u201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,358 to Kulish and Swank (1998) for \u201cRapid Cycle Pressure Swing Adsorption Oxygen Concentrator Method and Apparatus\u201d; and International Publication No.: WO 2006/044172 A2 to McCombs et. al. (2006) for \u201cMini-Portable Oxygen Concentrator.\u201d It has been a longstanding goal of oxygen concentrator designers to reduce adsorber size, while still providing for production of \u02dc2-8 liters/minute of about \u02dc90-93% pure O 2 from ambient air for home or hospital medical use. In seeking to accomplish that objective, one could employ any number of mechanisms, for instance, cyclic adsorptive process such as Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA), or Pressure-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA), and by employing a N 2 selective zeolite adsorbent. Despite the theories and available technology, nonetheless, this long-standing critical goal for the industry remains unmet. As described above, numerous patents have been issued which describe various process designs to approach this goal by manipulating the type of the adsorbent used, the synthesis of the process cycle steps, the total process cycle time, the adsorber and valving design, etc. One popular approach is to reduce the process cycle time so that the adsorbent is used more frequently, thereby increasing its specific O 2 productivity rate. Cycle times of few minutes (large commercial oxygen generators) to few seconds (small medical oxygen generators) are generally used. Cycle time of a fraction of a second has also been claimed. Despite the existence of such oxygen concentrator technology described in the literature, there exists a continuing and unmet need for even smaller, and preferably miniature, efficient, oxygen concentrator apparatus and systems that are suitable for individual use, both in terms of size and performance, as well as in terms of cost. Further, there is a need for miniature oxygen concentrators that can snap on or otherwise be installed on existing compressed air lines to provide a ready source of oxygen without the need for air compressor, air blower and/or vacuum pumps and other heavy components to provide oxygen having a purity of more than about 90%. SUMMARY Provided herein are new and inventive apparatus and methods for producing concentrated oxygen. The apparatus and methods allow for unprecedented advantages over known oxygen concentrators, such as reduction in size, weight, maintenance, power consumption, cycle times, and efficiency, among other things. In one embodiment, methods are provided for an inventive PSA gas separation and oxygen concentrator process. A rapid cyclic pressure swing adsorption (PSA) method for producing an oxygen enriched gaseous product containing more than 85 mole % oxygen. The method comprising the steps of: a) providing a feed gas comprising compressed ambient air; b) providing a gas separation apparatus comprising at least one adsorber column, the adsorber column packed with at least a layer of a desiccant adsorbent comprising particles of more than 1.0 mm hydraulic diameter in the feed gas side and at least a layer of a nitrogen selective particles of less than 0.5 mm hydraulic diameter in the product gas side; and c) carrying out a PSA separation process. The process includes the steps of: (1) co-currently pressurizing the at least one adsorber column using the received compressed ambient air; (2) co-currently directing flow of the compressed ambient air to produce an oxygen enriched product gas at a near feed gas pressure; (3) performing counter-current depressurization of the at least one adsorbent column to a near ambient pressure; and (4) performing a counter-current oxygen purge at ambient or sub-ambient pressure using at least a portion of the oxygen enriched product gas.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Provided herein are new and useful compact, portable, efficient apparatus and methods for producing concentrated oxygen. It is often customary by the industry to represent the oxygen (O 2 ) production rate from an adsorbent oxygen concentrator (or \u201csorber\u201d) in terms of tons per day of contained O 2 (TPD c ). For example, the TPD c rate for the schematic system shown in FIG. 1 hereof is given by 2.816 P/t c. FIG. 1 is a schematic box diagram for a generic sorptive oxygen generator system which can be a PSA, VSA, or PVSA process consisting of one or more parallel sorbers. The streams entering and leaving the system (containing a total of w gms of the sorbent) are the air feed (F), product O 2 (P), and the waste gas (W). The variables F, P and W are specific amounts (g\u00b7moles/cycle). The total cycle time for the process is t c (sec). The O 2 product contains 92% O 2 in the example. Two key performance variables characterizing any generic oxygen generator are represented by the following equations (1) and (2): (1) Bed Size Factor (BSF)=7.822\u00d710 \u22124 wt c /P, lbs (sorbent)/TPD c ; and (2) Oxygen Recovery, R=0.92 P/0.2096 F. BSF is critical to define the sorbent inventory of a process. In general, lower BSF is preferred (smaller adsorber beds). Oxygen recovery is a critical variable (higher is better), primarily for PSA &amp; PVSA systems where feed air is compressed before separation. Higher recovery lowers compression duty. However, it is not that critical for a VSA process where only an air blower is used along with a vacuum pump. For a given process cycle (cyclic process steps, operating conditions, system void, vessel design, individual steps and total cycle times, etc.) and sorbent (sorptive properties), one may define specific O 2 productivity of the process as N (=P/w), g\u00b7moles/g of sorbent in system/cycle. Hence, equations (3) and (4) apply: (3) BSF=7.822\u00d710 \u22124 t c /N; and (4) w=454 BSF\u00d7TPD C. It may be seen from Equations (3) &amp; (4) that for a defined process cycle and sorbent that BSF decreases as t c decreases provided that N is not, or a weak function of t c. Hence, BSF may linearly decrease with decreasing t c at larger cycle times, until N becomes a function of t c due to inefficiency introduced by slower sorption kinetics, gas-solid heat transfer resistance, pressure drop etc, at smaller values of t c (very fast cycle). Then BSF will not decrease with decreasing t c. It may level off or actually increase. See FIG. 2 , for example. Further, for a given O 2 productivity (TPD c ), the total adsorbent inventory of the process (w) decreases as BSF decreases. In other words, w (or sorber vessel sizes) can be reduced by lowering t c , but only up to a point. A key goal of the inventors&#39; activities described herein was to demonstrate the existence of the above limitation for a Skarstrom-like PSA cycle using a selected, commercially available adsorbent such as a LiX zeolite. Consequently, in the course of experimentation as described herein, the inventors discovered that the BSF of an adsorptive oxygen generator cannot be indefinitely decreased by lowering the process cycle time beyond a particular cycle time. In other words, the adsorber size cannot be indefinitely reduced below a certain size/amount by simply lowering the cycle time. This phenomenon is novel and was not previously recognized by those skilled in the art. Furthermore, in the preferred embodiments described herein, the inventors intentionally eliminated the requirement of commonly bulky, heavy, and cumbersome vacuum pumps by selecting PSA rather than VSA, PVSA. In that example, the inventors succeeded in showing this lowered BSF compared to various previous studies (as previously cited herein and in FIG. 8 ) that employed various samples of LiX zeolite and different PSA, VSA and PVSA process schemes (See, e.g. FIG. 8 ). These combined inventive factors provide for novel compact oxygen concentrators having a greatly reduced bed size and overall apparatus size, weight, and other significant performance characteristics.\u201d The inventors have also discovered apparatus and methods that provide an optimum cycle time for production of \u02dc90% O 2 from air, by providing, for example, a PSA cycle using a commercial LiX adsorbent which lowers the design BSF below any previously reported in the literature. In that example, the inventors succeeded in showing this lowered BSF compared to various previous studies (as previously cited herein and in FIG. 6 ) that employed various samples of LiX zeolite and different PSA, VSA and PVSA process schemes (See, e.g. FIG. 6 ). As further described herein, the inventors have reduced their conceptions to practice by building apparatus that execute inventive method steps. Text and diagrams provided herein are based upon the building, operation, and testing of the apparatus and associated methods. For example, in an exemplary embodiment consistent with FIG. 3 , the inventors built a miniature PSA O 2 generator. In this embodiment of FIG. 3 , the inventors built a miniature oxygen concentrator including a single column of sorbent (about 0.4 cm diameter\u00d710.8 cm long) containing \u02dc1.0 gm of commercial LiX zeolite (\u02dc350 micron diameter); having a total volume of about 1.3 cubic cm. Other components of this embodiment are represented in FIG. 3 , and discussed further herein. These measurements can be scaled up to meet the oxygen output desired by one skilled in the art. The PSA cycle used in our tests was very similar to the Skarstrom cycle. The feed gas was dry and CO 2 free synthetic air containing no argon. The process steps included: a. Adsorber pressurization to a super-ambient pressure with compressed feed air at pressure PA b. Flow of compressed air at PA to produce the \u02dc90% O 2 product gas at essentially feed gas pressure c. Counter-current depressurization to ambient pressure and reject the waste gas d. Counter-current purge with a synthetic product gas at near ambient pressure and reject the waste gas e. (Repeat of above cycle beginning from step a., as required) Tests were conducted using different adsorption pressures, individual step times and over-all cycle times. The product O 2 purity was maintained at \u02dc90% for all runs. Measured variables were BSF and O 2 recovery as functions of t c. Only runs where over-all and component mass balances closed within 2% were considered. FIGS. 4 and 5 show the test results (BSF and O 2 Recovery as functions of total cycle time) for a system using small particle size of \u02dc350 \u03bcm. \u201cPR\u201d indicates pressure ratio of the process (adsorption pressure/desorption pressure), in which desorption was carried out at near ambient pressure while adsorption at 2, 3 and 4 bar. In another embodiment, the four step cyclic PSA process described above is combined with and executed using a commercial LiX zeolite provided in a column of approximately the same size as that described in the embodiment of FIG. 3 , with a cycle time (tc) of about 2.5 to about 4 seconds, an adsorption pressure of about 3 bar, to produce a Bed Size Factor (BSF) of less than about 50 lb/TPD c. a BSF level not currently reported elsewhere, and clearly distinct from current patented processes, as illustrated in FIG. 6. FIG. 4 demonstrates that the BSF decreases nearly linearly (as by Equation (3)) as t c is decreased until t c reaches \u02dc3.5-4.0 seconds and then it levels off or even increases (at lower adsorption pressures) when the cycle time is further lowered. This demonstrates the basic hypothesis of the inventors that BSF cannot be indefinitely reduced, and hence the adsorbent quantity in the PSA system cannot be reduced indefinitely by simply lowering the cycle time of the PSA process. Furthermore, FIG. 4 shows that the optimum cycle time for lowering BSF is a strong function of feed gas pressure. The adverse effect of lowering cycle time on BSF is more pronounced as the adsorption pressure decreases. FIG. 5 shows that the O 2 recovery decreases as the cycle time is decreased and the adsorption pressure is decreased. This result is expected since void gas quantity in the system at the end of the adsorption step increases as the adsorption pressure increases and a part of the void (air like) is lost as waste gas in each cycle. Faster cycles accentuate this effect. FIGS. 6 and 7 show the test results (BSF and O 2 Recovery as functions of total cycle time) for a system including a column of the same size as that described for FIG. 3 , but having a bigger void volume than that of the apparatus used to generate the date of FIGS. 4-5 at the bed ends and using small particle size of \u02dc350 \u03bcm. FIG. 6 shows that the experimentally measured BSF decreases nearly linearly (as by Eqn. 3) as t c is decreased until t c reaches \u02dc3.5-4.0 seconds and then it levels off and even increases when the cycle time is further lowered, as shown schematically in FIG. 2. These figures illustrate the basic hypothesis of the inventors that BSF cannot be reduced indefinitely, and hence the adsorbent quantity in the PSA system can not be reduced indefinitely, by simply lowering the cycle time of the PSA process. Furthermore, FIG. 4 shows that the optimum cycle time for lowering BSF is a strong function of feed gas pressure. The adverse effect of lowering cycle time on BSF is more pronounced as the adsorption pressure decreases FIG. 7 shows that the O 2 recovery decreases as the cycle time is decreased and the adsorption pressure is decreased. With bigger void volume at the bed ends, O 2 recovery drops significantly as compared to those in FIG. 5 those FIG. 8 compares the BSF measured by the inventors&#39; testing as functions of cycle times for pressure ratio of 3 and O 2 purity of \u02dc90%. Also shown are published data which were obtained using various PSA, VSA and PVSA cycles, but all employing some variety of LiX zeolite. FIG. 8 , shows that (a) the present inventive PSA system and methods are capable of producing a BSF of less than 50 when a cycle time of 3-4 seconds and a adsorption pressure at 3 bar is used. This magnitude of BSF could not be achieved by published PSA or PVSA data. Only a very rapid VSA system operating at a very small cycle time of less than 2 seconds could break that barrier."

  "pos": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for activating cholinesterase. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for activating cholinesterase using a compound having prolyl endopeptidase inhibitory activity and a method for treating cocainism by the activation of cholinesterase using said compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cocaine is an alkaloid contained in coca (Erythroxylon coca) leaves a originally came from South America. It causes intense excitation, produces a dependency, and created a serious social problem of cocainism. Cocaine directly acts on the peripheral sensory nerve fiber to reversively paralyze the same, and shuts down production and conduction of afferent impulses. The pharmacological actions of cocaine include local anesthesia. Cocaine is advantageous in that it readily penetrates mucous membrane and infiltrates into tissues, and that it causes vasoconstriction to retard its systemic absorption, thereby prolonging anesthesia. The systemic effect produced by absorption is found in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Noticeable excitation proceeds from the upper site to the lower site in the CNS. Thus, at a lower dose, it first acts on the cerebral cortex to manifest mental uplift, the sense of increased intelligence, disappearance of fatigue, euphoria and hyperkinesis. Such condition characterized by feeling of being refreshed and possession of increased mental and physical capabilities is called cocaine drunkenness. On the other hand, its use in higher doses causes hallucination, derangement, berserk, tremor, clonic spasm, and respiratory excitation, elevation of blood pressure and body temperature, emesis and the like, all of which are caused by stimulation of medulla oblongata, and which in turn progress into suppression (e.g., coma), suppression of respiratory and cardiac functions and suppression of reflex mechanism of spinal cord. When continuously used, psychopathic symptoms such as anxiety, agrypnia, hallucination, delusion, derangement and the like, and physical symptoms of mydriasis, tachycardia, fervescence, convulsion and the like are observed. The mydriasis is also caused by peripheral(sympathetic) action of cocaine. Associated with such psychopathic symptoms, cocaine is classified as a narcotic. As a narcotic, cocaine is characterized by the fact that it seldom shows physical dependency but shows extremely strong psychological dependency. In a low or medium dose, its action on the cardiac function is secondary, resulting from its primary action on central and peripheral nerves. When a higher dose is intravenously administered, however, it may directly act on the myocardium to cause cardiac dysfunction. There have been also found central and peripheral actions on blood vessels. It inhibits catecholamine uptake at the adrenergic nerve ending and enhances action of norepinephrine on the vascular wall. A cholinesterase is an enzyme which hydrolyzes choline ester into choline and organic acid. There exist two types of the enzyme in the living body; acetylcholinesterase (true cholinesterase; EC 3.1.1.7) and cholinesterase (serum cholinesterase, pseudocholinesterase; EC 3.1.1.8). The former resides in the nerve tissues, muscles, erythrocytes and the like, and specifically decomposes acetylcholine. The latter is synthesized in the liver and secreted into serum. While its biological role has not been fully elucidated, it decomposes, besides acetylcholine, various choline esters and non-choline esters. The metabolism of cocaine is complicated, since it depends on various enzyme activities, doses and administration routes. The major metabolites are three compounds; norcocaine, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methylester. Given a report on the use of an organophosphate insecticide (cholinesterase inhibitor) for prolongation of cocaine excitement and a report which indicates that the metabolism of cocaine is shifted largely toward benzoylecgonine, but also somewhat toward norcocaine at low cholinesterase activity, Hoffman et al. documented a report which concludes, &#34;when plasma cholinesterase activity is low, 1) metabolism of cocain is slowed and its toxicity is prolonged, 2) metabolism of cocain is shunted away from the nontoxic ecgonine methylester and toward the active metabolite norcocaine or potentially active metabolite benzoylecgonine.&#34; They conclude that the both mechanisms in combination enhance cocaine toxicity and that, by reference to recent findings, serum cholinesterase activity is considered to be an important determinant of cocaine toxicity (Journal of Toxicology, Clinical Toxicology, 34 (3), 259-266 (1996)). Therefore, once the serum cholinesterase activity can be improved, the above-mentioned problems will be solved, and the treatment of cocainism will be facilitated. The present inventors have surprisingly found that a compound having a prolyl endopeptidase inhibitory activity can specifically activate the serum cholinesterase activity. Hence, administration of a compound having a prolyl endopeptidase inhibitory activity to patients will lead to the cure of cocainism.

  "pos": "REFERENCE TO PENDING PRIOR PATENT APPLICATION This is a continuation of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/619,105, filed Jul. 19, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,830 by E. Marlowe Goble et al. for APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR RECONSTRUCTING A LIGAMENT, which in turn claims benefit of prior U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/144,773, filed Jul. 20, 1999 by Eugene Marlowe Goble et al. for DEVICE AND METHOD TO HOLD GRAFT WITH A TRANSVERSE PIN. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to medical devices and procedures in general, and more particularly to medical devices and procedures for reconstructing a ligament. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A ligament is a piece of fibrous tissue which connects one bone to another. Ligaments are frequently damaged (e.g., detached or torn or ruptured, etc.) as the result of injury and/or accident. A damaged ligament can impede proper motion of a joint and cause significant pain. Various procedures have been developed to repair or replace a damaged ligament. The specific procedures used depend on the particular ligament which is to be restored and on the extent of the damage. One ligament which is frequently damaged as the result of injury and/or accident is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Looking now at FIG. 1 , the ACL 5 extends between the top of the tibia 10 and the bottom of the femur 15. A damaged ACL can cause instability of the knee joint and cause substantial pain and arthritis. Numerous procedures have been developed to restore the ACL through a graft ligament replacement. In general, and looking now at FIG. 2 , these ACL replacement procedures involve drilling a bone tunnel 20 through tibia 10 and up into femur 15. Then a graft ligament 25 , consisting of a harvested or artificial ligament or tendon(s), is passed through the tibial portion 30 of tunnel 20 (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe tibial tunnel\u201d), across the interior of the joint, and up into the femoral portion 35 of tunnel 20 (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe femoral tunnel\u201d). Then a distal portion of graft ligament 25 is secured in femoral tunnel 35 , and a proximal portion of graft ligament 25 is secured in tibial tunnel 30. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide improved apparatus for positioning the graft ligament in the bone tunnel and/or for securing the graft ligament within the bone tunnel. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for reconstructing a ligament.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be more fully disclosed or rendered obvious by the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, which is to be considered together with the accompanying drawings wherein like numbers refer to like parts, and further wherein: FIG. 1 is a schematic side view of a knee joint, showing an ACL extending between the top of the tibia and the bottom of the femur; FIG. 2 is a schematic side view of the same knee joint, except showing portions of an ACL reconstruction; FIGS. 3\u20137 are schematic front views of a knee joint, illustrating a crosspinning procedure utilizing a first type of crosspin; FIG. 8 is a schematic front view of a knee joint, illustrating a crosspinning procedure utilizing a second type of crosspin; FIG. 9 is a schematic front view of a knee joint, illustrating a crosspinning procedure utilizing a third type of crosspin; FIGS. 10\u201312 are schematic views illustrating a crosspinning procedure utilizing a graft ligament comprising a bone block; FIGS. 13\u201315 are schematic views illustrating another crosspinning procedure utilizing a graft ligament comprising a bone block; FIGS. 16\u201318 are schematic views illustrating still another crosspinning procedure utilizing a graft ligament comprising a bone block; FIGS. 19\u201321 are schematic views illustrating a crosspinning procedure utilizing a plate and a graft ligament comprising a bone block; and FIG. 22 is a schematic view illustrating another crosspinning procedure utilizing a plate and a graft ligament comprising a bone block. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Non-Cannulated Crosspin In one form of the invention, there is provided a novel non-cannulated crosspin for supporting a graft ligament in a bone tunnel. More particularly, and looking now at FIG. 3 , during one type of ACL reconstruction, the bone tunnel 20 is formed by drilling through tibia 10 and up into femur 15 , whereby to form tibial tunnel 30 and femoral tunnel 35. Then a transverse bone tunnel 40 is formed in femur 15 so that transverse bone tunnel 40 intersects femoral tunnel 35. Bone tunnel 20 bifurcates transverse bone tunnel 40 into two tunnel portions, a first transverse bone tunnel portion 45 and a second transverse bone tunnel portion 50. After transverse bone tunnel 40 has been formed, a flexible member 55 is used to draw graft ligament 25 up into place. There are a number of ways that this may be accomplished and, for the purposes of the present invention, all are satisfactory. However, for purposes of example but not limitation, a particular method for drawing graft ligament 25 into place using flexible member 55 will now be reviewed. First, flexible member 55 is threaded through transverse bone tunnel 40. Then a crochet-hook device (not shown) is passed up tibial tunnel 30 , across the interior of the knee joint, and up femoral tunnel 35. The crochet-hook device is used to hook flexible member 55 at the intersection of bone tunnel 20 and transverse bone tunnel 40. Then the crochet-hook device is used to pull flexible member 55 down femoral tunnel 35 , across the interior of the knee joint, down tibial tunnel 30 , and out the front side of tibia 10. Next, graft ligament 25 is looped over flexible member 55 ( FIG. 3 ). If desired, graft ligament 25 can be secured around flexible member 55 by a suture, a clip or a tie device (not shown) so as to prevent graft ligament 25 from slipping off flexible member 55. Flexible member 55 is then used to pull the looped graft ligament 25 up tibial tunnel 30 , across the interior of the knee joint, and then up into femoral tunnel 35 ( FIG. 4 ). Once graft ligament 25 and flexible member 55 have assumed the position shown in FIG. 4 , the graft ligament may be retained in that position through the use of a novel non-cannulated crosspin. More particularly, and looking now at FIGS. 5\u20137 , graft ligament 25 may be supported in femoral tunnel 35 with a novel crosspin 60. Crosspin 60 generally comprises a solid shaft 65 having a distal portion 66 , an intermediate portion 67 and a proximal portion 68. One or more openings 70 are formed in the shaft&#39;s distal portion 66 , and screw threads 75 are formed in the shaft&#39;s intermediate portion 67 , adjacent to proximal portion 68. Crosspin 60 also comprises a recess 80 in its proximal portion 68 for receiving the front end of a driver 85 ( FIG. 6 ). Crosspin 60 is deployed by (1) attaching one end, 55 A, of flexible member 55 to crosspin 60 using openings 70 ( FIG. 5 ); (2) drawing crosspin 60 across first transverse bone tunnel portion 45 , under the looped graft ligament 25 , across second transverse bone tunnel portion 50 , and out the far side of transverse bone tunnel 40 , until the crosspin&#39;s screw threads 75 engage femur 15 ; (3) turning crosspin 60 with driver 85 so that threads 75 are set into femur 15 ( FIG. 6 ); and (4) removing the distal and proximal portions of crosspin 60 that extend beyond the outside surfaces of femur 15 ( FIG. 7 ). Non-Cannulated Crosspin with Pre-Attached Flexible Member Looking next at FIG. 8 , there is shown a novel non-cannulated crosspin 60 A which is similar to the crosspin 60 described above, except that the distal portion 66 A of crosspin 60 A has flexible member 55 permanently attached thereto. Thus, with crosspin 60 A, flexible member 55 does not need to be connected to the crosspin at the time of use, as is the case with the crosspin 60 discussed above. With this one exception, crosspin 60 A is intended to be used in substantially the same way as the crosspin 60 discussed above. As an additional alternative construction, distal portion 66 A of crosspin 60 A may be joined to intermediate portion 67 A of the crosspin through a male/female screw mount, such as is shown generally at 90. Such a feature facilitates removal of distal portion 66 A from intermediate portion 67 A after the crosspin has been set in femur 15. Of course, if desired, such a screw mount may also be incorporated into the construction of the crosspin 60 discussed above. Cannulated Crosspin Looking next at FIG. 9 , there is shown a novel cannulated crosspin 60 B. Crosspin 60 B is identical to the crosspin 60 discussed above, except that (1) crosspin 60 B lacks the openings 70 formed in the distal portion 66 of the crosspin 60 discussed above, and (2) crosspin 60 B is cannulated along its length with a longitudinal bore 95. In use, flexible member 55 and graft ligament 25 are first positioned in the manner shown in FIG. 4 , and then crosspin 60 B is slipped over the free end 55 A of flexible member 55 , with flexible member 55 being received in the crosspin&#39;s longitudinal bore 95. Crosspin 60 B is then advanced along flexible member 55 so that the crosspin passes through first transverse bone tunnel portion 45 , under the looped graft ligament 25 , and through second transverse bone tunnel portion 50 , until the crosspin&#39;s threads 75 B engage the outer surface of femur 15. A cannulated driver (not shown, but similar to the driver 85 shown in FIGS. 6\u20138 , except that it is cannulated) is then loaded over the free end 55 A of flexible member 55 , advanced along flexible member 55 , and then used to advance crosspin 60 B so that the crosspin&#39;s screw threads 75 B are set in femur 15. The cannulated driver is then withdrawn, flexible member 55 is removed, and the crosspin&#39;s protruding distal portion 66 B and proximal portion 60 B trimmed off so as to complete the crosspinning procedure. Crosspinning a Graft Ligament Comprising a Bone Block In another novel aspect of the present invention, and looking now at FIGS. 10\u201318 , there is disclosed a novel method for crosspinning a graft ligament comprising a bone block. More particularly, in the preceding sections, the present invention has been discussed in the context of a graft ligament 25 comprising a loop of soft tissue, e.g., a hamstring tendon. However, it is also possible to crosspin a graft ligament comprising a bone block. More particularly, and looking now at FIGS. 10 and 11 , there is shown a graft ligament 25 A comprising a ligament 100 and a bone block 105. By way of example but not limitation, graft ligament 25 A might be a patellar graft comprising a portion of the patella tendon and a portion of the patella. Such graft ligaments are sometimes preferred since ligament 100 is naturally, and hence securely, attached to bone block 105 , and since it is relatively easy to achieve good osseointegration between bone block 105 and femur 15."

  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which objectively measures a refractive power of an eye to be examined. 2. Description of Related Art It is conventionally known an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which projects a target for measurement onto a fundus of an eye to be examined and objectively measures a refractive power of the eye based on the reflected light therefrom. When precisely measuring a refractive power of the eye using this kind of apparatus, the measurement is carried out usually by relaxing accommodation of the eye by a fogging mechanism and the measurement is repeated a plurality of times. Statistical processes are given to the measurement results obtained thereby such as letting the median or the average be the typical value of the all data values indicating the eye refractive power. The value obtained through the statistical processes is utilized as an initial value in a subjective measurement to be performed next. However, when measuring an eye which has low hyperopia, an examinee looks into the apparatus and thus so-called instrumental myopia is often caused. As a result, the accommodation of the eye is likely to be unstable. Owing to the unstableness of the accommodation, it may be the case where all the measurement results indicate a negative (or minus) spherical power, or only one result out of three indicates a positive (or plus) spherical power. Upon these cases, if decided in the aforementioned way, the typical value will be of a negative power. Judging from this typical value, an examiner may diagnose that the eye as myopia. If a subjective refractive power measurement is started from a negative spherical power, with a continues accommodation, it is extremely difficult to obtain corrective spherical value for the hyperopic eye by relaxing the accommodation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to overcome the above problems and to provide an eye refractive power measurement apparatus capable of providing a measurement result which secures accuracy in a subjective refractive power measurement to be performed next even in cases measuring an eye which possibly has low hyperopia. Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus including measurement means for objectively measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia and data output means for outputting data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. In another aspect of the present invention, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus including measurement means for objectively measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results by giving a predetermined statistical process to the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging that the eye possibly has low hyperopia if both positive and negative spherical powers are included in the plurality of measurement results stored in the memory means, all of the measurement results includes 0 diopter spherical power, both 0 diopter and negative spherical powers are included in the plurality of the measurement results, or all of the measurement results includes negative spherical powers and are greater than a predetermined negative spherical power, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value by giving a predetermined process if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia and data output means for outputting data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. In another aspect of the present invention, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus for measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises objective measurement means for objectively measuring the refractive power of the eye, memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the objective measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, subjective measurement means for subjectively measuring a refractive power of the eye and subjective measurement control means for controlling the subjective measurement means based on data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. According to the present invention, even in cases of measuring an eye which possibly has low hyperopia, the apparatus is capable of providing measurement data which helps a subjective refractive power measurement which is performed next to be accurate. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the objects, advantages and principles of the invention. In the drawings, FIG. 1 is an overview of an eye refractive power measurement apparatus of the preferred embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a view showing a schematic arrangement of optical systems of the apparatus; FIG. 3 is a view showing a schematic arrangement of a control system of the apparatus; and FIG. 4 is a view showing a schematic arrangement of a control system of the apparatus according to the modified embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A detailed description of one preferred embodiment of an objective eye refractive power measurement apparatus embodying the present invention will now be given referring to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is an overview of the apparatus of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Reference numeral 1 denotes a base and 2 is a face support unit for supporting an examinee&#39;s face. 3 is a body and 4 is a measuring part containing optical systems as hereinafter described. Responding to operations of a joystick 5, the body 3 slides along a horizontal plane of the base 1 in back-and-forth and side-to-side directions. By turning a rotation knob 5a, the measuring part 4 moves in up-and-down directions in relation to the body 3. For the details of this joystick mechanism, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,406,076 which corresponds to Japanese Patent Publication of unexamined patent application No. HEI 6-7292 by the present applicant. The joystick 5 is provided with a measurement starting switch 6 at the top thereof. 7 is a TV monitor to display information such as an image of an anterior part of the eye and the like. 8 is a switch part which includes a print switch, a setting switch utilized upon output of a reference value for low hyperopia and the like. FIG. 2 is a view showing a schematic arrangement of the optical systems of the apparatus. Reference numeral 10 denotes an eye refractive power optical system. 11 is a pair of light sources for measurement which emits measurement light having its wavelength within an infrared range. The light sources 11 are arranged to be rotatable on an optical axis. 12 is a condenser lens. 13 is a target plate for measurement provided with a target for measurement (a spot aperture) thereon. The target plate 13 is movable so as to be moved to a conjugate position with a fundus of the eye E. 14 is a projecting lens, 15 and 16 are beam splitters, 17 is an objective lens, 18 and 19 are relay lenses. 20 is a strip-shaped corneal reflection eliminating mask which is arranged at a conjugate position with a cornea of the eye E to be rotatable on an optical axis. 21 is a movable lens which moves along with the target plate 13. 22 is an image forming lens. 23 is a photo-detector for measurement which rotates about the optical axis being synchronized with the light sources 11 and the corneal reflection eliminating mask 20. Reference numeral 30 denotes a fixation target optical system. 31 is a mirror. 32 is a first relay lens which moves along an optical axis and thereby fogs the eye E. 33 is a second relay lens, 34 is a fixation target which is arranged at a focal point of the second relay lens 33. 35 is a condenser lens and 36 is an illumination lump. Reference numeral 40 denotes a target projecting optical system which projects a light bundle to form an image of a target for alignment from a direction of a visual axis. A point light source 41 emits infrared light for projecting a target. The light from the light source 41 is first reflected by a beam splitter 42 and then passes through the projecting lens 14 thereby made to be parallel to the visual line. The light will be projected from the front of the eye E along the optical axis for measurement so that an image of the target for alignment is formed upon the cornea. Reference numeral 45 denotes an observation target detection optical system. An image of an anterior part of the eye E illuminated by unillustrated light source and the image of the target for alignment formed by the target projecting optical system 40 are first reflected by the beam splitter 15, and then photographed by a CCD camera 48 through an object lens 46 and a mirror 47. It is also possible to separately provide an observation optical system and a target detection optical system to detect the target image for alignment which is projected onto the eye E. FIG. 3 is a view showing a schematic arrangement of a control system of the apparatus. Picture signals from the CCD camera 48 are synthesized in an image synthesizing circuit 52 with signals of characters and graphics which are generated in a display circuit 51 so as to be displayed on the TV monitor 7. A control circuit 50 for controlling the whole apparatus is connected to an A/D converter 54 which digitizes signals from the photo-detector 23, a driver 55 for the light sources 11, a driver 57 for a motor 56 which rotates the light sources 11, the corneal reflection eliminating mask 20 and the photo-detector 23, a driver 59 for a motor 58 which moves the target plate 13 and the movable lens 21, and the like (although it is not illustrated, each of the divers for the first relay lens 32, the illumination lump 36 and the point light source 41 is likewise connected to the controller 50). 60 is a potentiometer which detects a position of the target plate 13 (the movable lens 21) and 61 is a detection processing circuit for the detection. 62 is a memory to store the measurement result. 63 is a printer and 64 is a driver for the printer 63. An interface circuit 65 is connected to a subjective refractive power measurement apparatus 66 and sends/receives data therebetween. The subjective refractive power measurement apparatus 66 is the type of apparatus which is provided with a lens unit 66a; the lens unit 66a which is composed of a pair of right and left parts places one optical element among various kinds of optical elements alternatively at a test window by electric power. 66b is a controller for the lens unit 66a. In a measurement carried out by the subjective refractive power measurement apparatus 66, a test chart is presented through the corrective optical system provided at the test window. A refractive power of the eye E will be subjectively measured based on responses from the examinee. Operations of the apparatus having above-described configuration will be explained hereinafter. First, the eye E is to be fixed at a predetermined position with use of the face support unit 2. As observing an image of the anterior part of the eye E displayed on the TV monitor 7, alignments are made by operating the joystick 5 and the rotation knob 5a so as to bring a reticle mark generated in the display circuit 51 and an image of the target for alignment formed by the target projecting optical system 40 into predetermined positions in relation to each other. When the alignment is completed, measurement is to be started at a push of the measurement starting switch 6. The measurement light emitted from the light sources 11 successively passes through the condenser lens 12, the target plate 13, the beam splitter 42, the projecting lens 14 and the beam splitter 15, then converges in the vicinity of the cornea of the eye E. Thereafter, the measurement light arrives upon the fundus of the eye E thereby projects a target for measurement by the target plate 13 thereon. In case of an emmetropic eye, an image of the target for measurement reflected from the fundus of the eye E is reflected by the beam splitter 15, passes though the object lens 17, reflected again by the beam splitter 16, passes through the relay lense 18, the relay lense 19 and then the image forming lens 22 thereby form an image on the photo-detector 23. If the eye E has a refractive error, the motor 58 is driven so as to move the target plate 13 along with the movable lens 21 to a conjugate position with the fundus of the eye E in accordance with a receive signal responsive to reflected light from the fundus received by the photo-detector 23. Next, the first relay lens 32 is moved so as to place the fixation target 34 and the fundus of the eye E at conjugate positions with each other, and further moves the first relay lens 32 so that the adequate amount of diopter is to be fogged. With the eye E being fogged, the light sources 11, the corneal reflection eliminating mask 20 and the photo-detector 23 are made to be rotated 180\u00b0 about the optical axis. During the rotation, the target plate 13 and the movable lens 21 move in response to the signal from the photo-detector 23. The potentiometer 60 detects the amount of the movement and thereby obtains a value of a refractive power in each meridian direction. The controller 50 gives a predetermined process to the obtained refractive power so as to obtain values of S (spherical power), C (cylindrical power) and A (cylindrical axial angle). For this measurement method of an eye refractive power, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,697 corresponding to Japanese Patent Publication of unexamined patent application No. HEI 7-39517 by the present applicant. Such measurement as described above is repeated a plurality of times on one and the same eye to be examined. The measurement may be repeated by depressing the measurement starting switch 6 a plurality of times or by programming to do so automatically in response to one trigger signal (measurement starting signal). The controller 50 stores the data obtained from the repeated measurements into the memory 62 and gives a predetermined statistical process to the data so as to obtain its typical value. This is to select an initial corrective optical system in accordance with the typical value for a subjective refractive power measurement which is to be performed next, which allows even an unskilled examiner in optometry to easily decide an accurate initial value for the corrective optical system. The typical value may be decided, for example, by ranking the obtained values in order of their sizes to make the median be the typical value (or the average value of all the obtained data can be the typical value). As well as calculating the typical value, the controller 50 judges whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia. In cases where it is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, the controller 50 calculates a desirable value (hereinafter mentioned as a recommendation value) which is a suitable value to be used as an initial value in the subjective refractive power measurement. It is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia in cases where (a) both positive and negative spherical powers are included in the obtained values of S, (b) all the values of S are equal to 0D [Diopter], both 0D and negative spherical powers are included in the obtained values of S, or all the values of S are negative spherical powers and weaker than a predetermined standard value (for example, -1.00 D or greater). When it is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, the recommendation value is decided in the following way. In the cases of (a), the greatest value of S among all the measurement data is picked out to be the recommendation value. It is also possible to determine the recommendation value by adding a predetermined value to the average or the median of the obtained data from which data of S having negative degrees is excluded."

  "pos": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to compositions for face and body skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The desire to look young and healthy is universal. The primary attributes of the young and healthy-looking skin are evenness of the skin color and texture. Age spots and other skin hyperpigmentation are undesirable. In many parts of the world, consumers also want to lighten their background skin color. Accordingly, there is a need for commercially feasible, effective skin care compositions, especially skin lightening products. Various compositions comprising some substituted diamines or related structures have been described, for example in EP 2193779 (Cognis); WO 2005/016895 (KIM); WO 2008/009860 (L&#39;Oreal); Hirota et al., U.S. Pat.

Process of Making Substituted Diamines Reagents &amp; Analytical Methods All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, EMD Chemicals) and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Parallel reactions and parallel solvent removal were performed using a Buchi Syncore reactor (Buchi Corporation, New Castle, Del.). Reaction monitoring was performed using either thin layer chromatography (TLC) or gas chromatography (GC). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 F 254 plates (EMD Chemicals) and visualizing by UV (254 nm), 4% phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) in ethanol (EtOH), 4% ninhydrin in ethanol and/or using an iodine chamber. GC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II Plus Gas Chromatograph equipped with a HP-1 crosslinked methyl silicone gum (25 m\u00d70.2 mm\u00d70.33 mm film thickness) column operated by GC Chemstation (HP, version A.06.01 [403], Hewlett Packard) software and the following parameters and gradient applied; injector temp 250\u00b0 C., oven temp: 70\u00b0 C. (2 min), ramp at 25\u00b0 C./min up to 250\u00b0 C., held at 250\u00b0 C. (11 min). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters 2695 Separations Module equipped with a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector and operated with Empower Pro software (Waters Corp.). Separations were carried out at 1 ml/min on a Restek Pinnacle DB C18 column (5 um, 4.6\u00d7150 mm) maintained at 30\u00b0 C. Samples for HPLC were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of sample in 1 ml mobile phase A:B (1:1) and injecting 5 \u03bcL onto the column. The mobile phase consisted of A=0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and B=0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (ACN) operated using gradient elution from 95:5 A:B to 5:95 A:B (gradient, 25 min) followed by 100% B (isocratic, 5 min). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using a Finnigan Mat LCQ Mass Spectrometer via direct infusion of samples (50 ppm) in methanol and the total ion count monitored using electrospray ionization in the (+) mode (ESI+). 1 H and 13 C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed using a Eft-60 NMR Spectrometer (Anasazi instruments, Inc.) and processed using WinNuts software (Acorn NMR, Inc.). Melting points were determined using a Meltemp apparatus (Laboratory Devices). Purity was determined by HPLC-UV/Vis or GC.

  "query": "What system employs thermal ablation for tissue treatment using cryoprobes and integrates procedure data for real-time monitoring and adjustment?,",
  "negative": "The technological advancement in question pertains to the utilization and application of cryoprobes to thermally ablate biological tissues. This involves the assimilation and analysis of crucial procedure data including the inflow and outflow temperatures at specific locations along the cryoprobe's conduits. The system strategically leverages this data to calculate a distinctive procedure profile. This profile is meticulously compared with a pre-established planning signature, derived from previously acquired imaging or a tissue model. Emphasis is placed on adapting the infusion rate of the cryogenic agent to align with the dynamic intervention requirements. Additionally, the system incorporates the ability to optimize the application of thermal energy to the biological material based on sophisticated comparative analyses, which are conducted in real-time during the therapeutic procedure. This ensures that the application of thermal energy is modulated according to the up-to-the-minute insights gained from the continuous comparison of the procedure's thermal profile against the initial plan. Furthermore, the system includes an apparatus that enables the use of a cryogenic fluid having a freezing point well below -90\u00b0C. This fluid could be one amongst a variety of specified liquids with adequate properties for cryogenic use. The process benefits from the capability of accommodating real-time modifications to the thermal energy administered, corresponding to the evolving information derived from the ongoing comparisons. In an embodiment, the system includes a feedback loop within a computing device designated to quantify the variance between the planned and the actual procedural signatures. It then determines the necessary adjustments to the cryoprobe's operational settings with an objective to reconcile any disparities and achieve convergence with the planned therapeutic outcome. This method enhances the efficacy of thermal ablation treatments, optimizing them for the specific biological tissue being treated.\n\n",
  "pos": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of provisional patent application No. 61/203,313, filed Dec. 23, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to planning, monitoring and regulation of temperature gradients, or isotherms, for thermal treatment of tissue, and in particular, the cryoablation of tissue. Thermal treatment of tissues has become an increasingly effective method of treatment for a variety of pathological cases. For example, malignancies in body organs such as liver, lungs, kidney, prostate, breast, and other organs are successfully treated by thermal ablation when heat or cold irreversibly destroys pathological tissue. Target temperatures are generally emphasized since irreversible changes that destroy a cell occur more reliably at those levels, but the time that those target temperatures are maintained are also important. For example, consistent cell death using heat usually requires temperatures greater than 50\u00b0 C. for over one (1) minute, while tissue freezing usually requires two (2) cycles of target tissue temperatures less than \u221220\u00b0 C. for greater than three (3) minutes each, interspaced by a passive thaw of greater than three (3) minutes. These general assumptions are variable depending upon local tissue conditions of: 1) adjacent blood vessels, or vasculature, acting as heat sinks; 2) tissue perfusion from blood flow of the micro vasculature, and; 3) the overall thermal characteristics of the tissue, such as thermal conductivity and capacity, which appear related to the ratio of fluid and/or fibrous content. In connection with cryo-treatments, the localized anatomy surrounding a target area to be treated (e.g., frozen), or tumor, may be assessed by various imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US), X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound clearly shows only the bright echoes from the leading edge of the ice closest to the ultrasound probe. The interface between frozen and non-frozen tissue has marked sound speed differences. Nearly all echoes are reflected with minimal signal penetrating the iceball. This causes marked shadowing behind the leading ice edge, obscuring all posterior structures. Plain X-ray technique is only capable of showing the border of the lower density frozen tissue. This is possible, however, only if the tissue is sufficiently compressed to allow detection of the density difference as a projected shadow that is perpendicular to the main axis of the x-ray. Both ultrasound and x-ray techniques thus provide only partial information concerning the size and position of three-dimensional frozen tissue, and cannot define the full three-dimensional cryoablation volume contained within the frozen tissue. CT and MRI techniques are preferred over ultrasound and x-ray since they can produce a reconstructed tissue volume from the usual sequence of axial images. In addition, they can be performed before, during and after intravenous contrast enhancement to assess the vascularity of the target tumor relative to the surrounding tissues. CT is more readily available than interventional MR units within the community and doesn&#39;t have metal incompatibility issues. However, MRI can provide greater contrast between the different soft and/or frozen tissues than CT and has temperature-sensitive imaging sequences. Unlike CT, MRI uses no ionizing radiation, but uses a powerful magnetic field and pulsed radiofrequency fields to cause the hydrogen nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner. These signals can be manipulated by additional magnetic fields to build up enough information to construct a volumetric image of the target object. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,773,408 and 6,904,305 relate to MRI medical interventional procedures and therapies, applying ablation energy to the target tissues, and further relate to monitoring such therapy by magnetic resonance application. The technology described in the &#39;408 and &#39;305 patents are partially based on the fact that certain known MRI sequences are temperature sensitive, so that magnetic resonance data acquired using these procedures will indicate changes in the temperature of the tissues. For example, a magnetic resonance parameter referred to as T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) will vary with temperature. If a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus is actuated to acquire T1 for various volume elements within the subject, the data for different elements will vary with temperature, at least within a tissue having generally the same composition. The data can be displayed as a visible image, and hence different temperatures can be shown by the differences in brightness or color within the displayed image. Unfortunately, this approach can only display the degree of the heating within a location within the body being heated. These procedures have been well known but have not been widely adopted in the medical practice. Magnetic resonance imaging instruments include large, precise magnets which are arranged to impose a high magnetic field but also severely limit access to the target subject. Moreover, the MRI instruments must be such so as to be substantially unaffected by the MRI system&#39;s powerful magnetic field. Medical instruments constructed of non-MRI-compatible materials may be subjected to powerful undesired forces generated by magnetic interaction between the instrument and the MRI magnetic field that may distort the MRI image. Additionally, electrical circuits used within the MRI environment must be shielded because they may be subject to induced currents generated within the electrical circuitry. Induced current can lead to uncontrolled processes such as distortion of data or control signals. Electric currents induced by an external magnetic field interacting with components of electronic circuitry could have a distorting effects during its normal operation. For example, electronic circuits with switching components which are switching at high frequencies (e.g., computers) and with potential for emission of electromagnetic fields must be strictly shielded. Another shortcoming of MRI is that commercially available MRI systems do not detect and display temperatures within frozen tissue. Research has been done evaluating ultrashort echo-times to assess the R 2 * parameter and generate temperature assessment within the iceball but these sequences are complex and specialized to limited centers. What is needed is a system that provides capability of direct identification or localization of the isotherms within frozen tissue with reliable identification of the external border of the ablation volume. What is further needed is a system that is capable of providing accurate estimation of the size and position of an ablation volume in cryosurgery, since it is a goal to ablate all pathological tissue while damaging as little as possible of healthy tissue surrounding the pathological tissue. What is further needed is to enable a physician, during a procedure, to have accurate information of what tissues have been frozen. What is further needed is a system adapted to render the border of the ablation volume, or alternatively a system facilitating accurate estimation of the size and position of such a border, to decrease danger of surgical complications and avoid various deleterious consequences to the long-term health and quality of life of the recovering patient. Attempts to provide systems for MRI-guided cryosurgery are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,697 and US Pat. Application No. 2006/0155268. The &#39;697 patent describes a system with inner and outer modules for MRI-guided cryosurgery comprising an MRI magnet having an opening for enabling access of a surgeon to the patient who is accommodated inside the MRI room, a line member of a surgical device extending through MRI magnet channel, a surgical device itself including: (a) an operating member for operating the patient; (b) a control member for controlling the operating member, the control member being positioned externally to the MRI room; (c) a line member having a first end connectable to the operating member and a second end connectable to said control member, wherein a portion of the line member is received within the channel of the MRI magnet. The line member includes an underground portion extending through an underground channel. The operating member is a cryogenic probe including a Joule-Thomson heat exchanger, and the line member is a gas tube. The control member includes a microprocessor for controlling the operation of cryosurgical device. A display member is positioned within the MRI room, the display member being electrically connected to the microprocessor for providing information relating to the operation. The cryogenic probe includes a thermal sensor electrically connected to the microprocessor. A disadvantage of the system described in the &#39;697 patent is the separation of control functions into inner and outer modules that requires two operators of the surgical equipment, a first operator being a surgeon positioned within the inner module, i.e., within magnetic field of the MRI equipment, and a second operator whose function includes inputting gas control commands and reporting to the surgeon the cryosurgery system status which the surgeon from his position into inner module cannot see and estimate for-himself, and cannot directly control. Another disadvantage of the system described in the &#39;697 patent is an impossibility to display and control temperatures within ablated frozen tissue because the thermal sensor placed at the distal end of the cryoprobe can provide only information about temperature in the central point of ablation volume. Application No. 2006/0155268 describes an MRI-guided and compatible cryosurgery system that comprises a cryoprobe operable to be cooled by expansion of high-pressure cooling gas though a Joule-Thomson orifice. This schematically presented system enable a surgeon positioned next to a patient and within an MRI magnetic environment both to monitor progress of an intervention by observing MR images of the intervention in real time, and to fully control aspects of operation of a cryosurgery. The apparatus described may remotely control a fluid supply source positioned external to the magnetic environment thereby enabling real-time MRI-guided control of a cryoablation process. A schematically presented embodiment enables calculation and display of borders of an ablation volume surrounding a cooled cryoprobe, and further enables automated control of elements of a cryoablation procedure, which elements are triggered when shape and position of the calculated ablation volume are found. The schematic intervention module may comprise a plurality of cryoprobes, an MRI-compatible template operable to guide insertion of the cryoprobe into the body of the patient, and a thermal sensor operable to be positioned at a selected position within the body. The cryoprobe may comprise a thermal sensor operable to report temperatures within the cryoprobe or to report temperature external to the cryo probe. A shortcoming of Application No. 2006/0155268 is that complete information about temperature distribution within the frozen volume of ablation with thermal sensors is unavailable. Additionally, the described temperature distribution profile across a schematic frozen tissue formed by the tip of cryosurgical probe, to the external surface of the frozen volume, appears somewhat arbitrary and unrealistic. Thus, there is a need to have a thermal ablation system that can provide to a physician isotherm distribution within the target tissue in order to plan, monitor and control tissue ablation using thermal response for anatomic and tissue characterization. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A system for use with at least one cryoprobe for the treatment of biological tissue with thermal ablation includes receiving procedure data wherein the procedure data comprises an inflow temperature at a location along an inflow conduit of the probe, and an outflow temperature at a location along the outflow conduit. The processor calculates a procedure signature or profile based on the procedure data and compares the procedure signature to a planning signature based on previously acquired image data and or model of the tissue. In another embodiment the planning signature is a planning isotherm volume of tissue and the procedure signature is a tissue isotherm volume obtained during the intervention, or cryoablation. In another embodiment the processor is further operative to compare the information and automatically regulate the flowrate of a cryogen to the cryoprobe. In another embodiment, a method is described for treatment of a target volume of biological tissue using at least one thermal tissue ablation apparatus. The method comprises a number of steps: 1) receiving procedure data, the procedure data comprising an inlet temperature of the fluid within the inlet conduit and at a location within the tissue treatment portion of the apparatus and an outlet temperature of the fluid within the outlet conduit and at a location within the tissue treatment portion of the apparatus; 2) determining a procedure signature based on the procedure data; and 3) comparing the procedure signature to a previously determined planning signature. In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises automatically applying an amount of thermal energy to the tissue based on the comparing step. In another aspect of the invention, the method further comprises the step of providing the thermal ablation apparatus wherein the fluid is a cold liquid with a freezing point less than \u221290\u00b0 C. another aspect of the invention, the cold liquid is one liquid selected from the group of propane, perfluropropane, R-124, and R-1270. In another aspect of the invention, the comparing step is performed substantially continuously during the treatment and the amount of thermal energy being applied is adjusted based on real time information determined by the comparing step. In one embodiment, a computer includes a feedback loop and calculates the difference between the two signatures and determines the amount of adjustment to the power parameters of the cryoprobe to force the procedure signature to match or converge with the planned signature. According to one aspect of the invention a method of treatment planning comprises observing a marker, or seed, that is deposited prior to treatment within the target volume and well-visualized by US, CT or MRI. The well-visualized marker is used at the beginning of the treatment session to confirm location of tumor margins and vascularity in relation to actual probe placement. The marker is then used to validate anatomic location of tumor margins and vascularity in relation to developing treatment margins during treatment, thus serving as one of the inputs to continuously adjusted probe power during treatment protocol. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method which allows monitoring of tissue response to thermal changes induced by probes inserted into the target treatment region, whereby that tissue thermal response is reflected in the difference between the inlet temperature of substance entering the exchange chamber at the probe tip and the outlet temperature as it exits the chamber. The disclosure and invention specifically include combination of features of various embodiments as well as combinations of the various embodiments where possible. The description, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description to follow, together with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 a illustrates a thermal ablation control system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Computer 100 is shown in communication with one or more cryoprobes 110 a - f. Computer 100 may be a general purpose computer including a processor. Computer is also in communication with (or has incorporated therein) a controller (not shown) to power the cryoprobes. In the case of a cryoprobe, the controller may control such parameters as flowrate of a cryogen liquid to the cryoprobe, temperature of the cryogen, actuate valves, etc. Additionally, a cryogen tank, refrigerator, pump, electrical supply, and other equipment may be housed in cabinet 120.

In another embodiment the cryoprobe does not have an exchange chamber per se. The conduit follows a path leading to and from the tissue treatment portion. More than one conduit may be provided and the conduit&#39;s cross section may vary in shape and size. As mentioned above, the present invention includes use of temperature data from the probe. To this end, probes that are useful with the system of the present invention include a sensor within each the fluid inlet conduit and fluid outlet conduit. Preferably, the sensors, such as thermocouples, are located in the tissue treatment portion or freeze zone of the probe and in some cases, in the most distal portion of the tip."

  "query": "What innovations does the invention offer regarding the dose counter in injection devices?,",
  "negative": "The invention outlines an apparatus for infusing medication with an improved mechanism for counting doses during the administration process. However, rather than relying on a counter activated upon dose adjustment, the device's counter is stimulated by the actual deployment of the dose. It encompasses a counter wheel system that interacts with an idler gear to tally dosages. The drive apparatus is endowed with a final dose element that obstructs further dose configuration once the last prescribed dose has been delivered, thereby addressing any risk of administering an insufficient dose. The drive mechanism includes a manual engagement feature that energizes an energy retention component, leading to the delivery of the dose upon trigger release. The design omits the integration of a day indicator as it relies on the dose application count mechanism, promoting user clarity on dosages dispensed. The invention articulates the design for fixed-volume dose delivery but can be adjusted for variable dose volumes. An anti-tamper aspect safeguards against premature activation or drug mixing, necessitating the removal of a restraining component, such as a cap or label, before device operation.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] This invention relates to injection apparatus, and in particular, though not exclusively, to injection apparatus designed to allow a number of doses to be delivered from a single cartridge or syringe over a period of time. [0003] 2. Description of the Related Art [0004] In many therapies a drug needs to be injected at daily or other periodic intervals. A potential problem arises because the user may not recall clearly whether they have taken a particular dose. There is therefore a need in such apparatus to provide an increment counter, or day of the week indicator, which indicates whether they have taken the dose for a particular period. Also, where a fixed volume dose is delivered each time, it is highly desirable to be able to signal to the user when all useable doses have been taken from the device to prevent a user from inadvertently taking a nil or incomplete dose. Although it is common on variable dose devices to provide a counter display to allow a user to dial in the number of units of medicament they wish to inject, these displays only indicate the magnitude of the dose to be delivered, and return to zero on completion of an injection. They do not indicate a dose application count i.e. the accumulated number of injections that have been performed by the device. [0005] In EP-A-1463550, we describe a dose application counter for an injection device having a dose counter member which has a lost motion connection to the dose setting element, so that, as a user sets the amount of the dosage volume prior to firing the device, the dose application counter is incremented by one count, irrespective of the number of units making up the dose. Although this is a good design, it increments the count on setting of the dose rather than actual delivery of the dose. It is possible therefore that if a user is distracted between the setting dose and delivering it, the dose application counter suggests that the dose for that period has already been taken. Also, after the device has been fired to deliver the final available dose, the dose setting knob can still be rotated to set a further dose even though subsequent firing of the device will not deliver a proper dose. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] Accordingly, we have designed an injection device in which a counter member is incremented in response to movement of the drive member that delivers the does and which is therefore incremented by dose delivery rather than dose setting. [0007] In one aspect this invention provides an injection apparatus including a drive arrangement actuatable to allow movement of a drive member to deliver a dose upon each such actuation, and a counter member drivingly connected to said drive member for being incremented by each dose delivery. [0008] In this arrangement, a cumulative dose count may be kept by incrementing the counter by a single uniform amount indicative of a usage, irrespective of the dose magnitude. [0009] Although the movement could be linear it is preferred for said drive member to be mounted for rotary movement and to rotate to deliver a dose. Thus the drive arrangement may include an elongate drive plunger threadedly engaged with said drive member and adapted to be advanced longitudinally to deliver a dose upon corresponding rotary movement of said drive member. [0010] There are numerous ways in which actual delivery of a dose increments or trips or counter mechanism to increment by suitable motion transfer. For example, the counter member may comprise a counter wheel having a toothed surface meshing with an idler cog, with said drive member carrying one or more cog teeth for engaging the teeth of the idler cog to increment the counter wheel during each dose delivery. Although the drive member cog teeth could be in continuous engagement with the idler cog, or the counter wheel itself, said drive member cog teeth preferably engage the idler cog intermittently, once per dose delivery. It will be appreciated that incrementing may occur at any time during a dose delivery cycle, but it is preferred for said counter member to be incremented part way through the cycle. Alternatively, other arrangements may be used where movement of the dose delivery mechanism or a component thereof is used to increment a counter by one unit during or on completion of dose delivery. This could be tripped by interaction of the plunger with a counter, or by similar interaction between any one or more of the components in the dose delivery mechanism. [0011] Conveniently, said drive mechanism includes a dose setting element for being manually twisted to energise an energy storage device associated with said drive member, and a releasable trigger for holding and releasing said drive member in and from its energised condition. [0012] The injection apparatus may conveniently include a final dose arrangement for blocking movement of said dose setting element after said drive plunger has advanced to a final dose position, thereby to prevent further dose setting. [0013] Where said drive arrangement includes a drive transfer element that rotates with, or is integral with, said dose setting element and is connectable to said drive member by a latching arrangement, the drive transfer element and the plunger may have associated therewith respective abutments that move into a blocking configuration when the drive plunger advances towards its final dose position, thereby substantially preventing rotational movement of the dose setting element and thus further dose setting movement. [0014] The apparatus may be designed to deliver fixed volume doses, or it may be adapted to deliver doses of adjustable volume. [0015] The final dose disabling feature may be used on devices that do not have a dose delivery counter. The invention therefore extends to an injection apparatus including a drive arrangement having a rotary drive gear threadedly engaged with an elongate threaded plunger to advance said elongate plunger to deliver a dose, a rotary dose setting element angularly movable against a bias from a rest position to an energised position in which it is in latching engagement with or latches with said rotary drive gear, a trigger arrangement adapted to hold and release the drive gear for rotary movement, wherein respective abutments associated with the drive plunger and the dose setting element move into a blocking configuration when said elongate plunger advances after successive doses to a final dose position, thereby preventing return of said rotary dose setting element to its latched, energised condition. [0020] The abutments may comprise respective cooperable lugs on the drive plunger and on the dose setting element, which cooperate to constrain or limit rotation of said dose setting element. [0021] Where the injection apparatus includes a housing having two relatively movable parts required to be moved relative to one another in an initialisation step prior to actuation to deliver a dose, for example to mix a multi-component drug, or to cock or to prime a device, it may include an anti-tamper arrangement to prevent said relative movement prior to release of the anti-tamper arrangement. [0022] Said anti-tamper arrangement may typically comprise a removable package for containing at least part of said device and adapted to hold said movable parts against initialisation movement, prior to removal of said package. [0023] Alternatively said anti-tamper arrangement may comprise a spacer element disposed to prevent said initialisation movement and removable from the apparatus. [0024] The removable spacer element may comprise a tear off band, a tear off label, or a removable spacer element is integrally formed with one of said housing parts e.g. by moulding. [0025] The invention also extends to an injection device comprising a housing having two relatively movable parts required to be moved relative to one another in initialisation step, prior to actuation to deliver a dose, and including an anti-tamper arrangement to prevent said relative movement prior to release of said anti-tamper arrangement. [0026] The invention also extends to an injection device that is set or primed and which includes an externally visual indicator that displays a change in colour or other visual characteristics when said device is set or primed. [0027] Whilst the invention has been described above, it extends to any inventive combination of the features set out above or in the following description, claims or drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES [0028] By way of example only, various embodiments of the invention will be now be described in detail, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which: [0029] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an injection device in accordance with an embodiment of this invention in its as supplied form, prior to retraction of the housing to reconstitute the drug; [0030] FIG. 2 is a view similar to FIG. 1 but showing the device after reconstitution of the drug and once two doses have been delivered; [0031] FIG. 3 is a detailed view on the front end of the device of FIGS. 1 and 2 showing the collar in a forward position; [0032] FIG. 4 is a view of the drive mechanism removed from the remainder of the device, with certain parts removed; [0033] FIG. 5( a ) is an exploded view of the drive mechanism, and FIGS. 5( b ) and ( c ) are details thereof; [0034] FIG. 6 is a detailed view on the plunger and ratchet drive shaft; [0035] FIG. 7 is a detailed view on the aft end of the plunger; [0036] FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view through the ratchet drive shaft, drive plunger and the drive gear; [0037] FIGS. 9 to 12 are views of various embodiments of an anti-tamper device that need to be removed prior to moving the housing from its extended position shown in FIG. 1 to that of FIG. 2 ; [0038] FIG. 13 is a detailed view on another form of anti-tamper feature; [0039] FIG. 14 is a detailed exploded view of part of the arrangement of FIG. 13 , and [0040] FIGS. 15( a ) to ( c ) are detailed views showing the anti-tamper feature of FIGS. 13 and 14 at various stages of operation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0041] The embodiment of injection device illustrated in the drawings is designed for use with a medicament which is supplied as two components in unmixed form in a dual chamber cartridge of known type as described, for example, in our earlier application WO2007/132191. As supplied, the cartridge has two spaced bungs which define two separate chambers and the drug is mixed by driving the rearward bung forwardly so that it causes the forward bung to move forwardly to reveal and open a bypass slot and thereafter to force the fluid in the rear chamber into the front chamber to mix with the substance. In such devices an initial longitudinal movement is required to reconstitute the drug whereafter the normal metered doses are required. In the embodiment described below the doses are all of a uniform volume but it will be appreciated that the device may easily be modified to provide a facility to deliver doses of variable volume. [0042] Referring to FIG. 1 , the injection device comprises a housing made up of a rear part 10 and a forward part 12 telescopically mounted on a reduced diameter position of the rear part. A drive unit 14 is secured to the rear end of the rear housing part 10 , and has a rotatable dial 16 at its rear end which is twisted to cock the device, and an actuator button 18 is slid forwardly to fire the device. The rotatable dial has a forward flange 11 that underlies the rear rim 13 of the outer shell 15 of the drive body. The rear rim is opaque apart from three transparent windows 17. The flange 11 of the dial has coloured patches 11 \u2032 disposed so that, when the dial 16 is in the cocked position, the patches 11 \u2032 align with the windows 17 to indicate a colour change to show readiness. [0043] At the front end of the forward housing 12 there is a sprung loaded collar 20 having a bayonet interlock which allows it to be twisted and released forwardly under the influence of a spring 21 to reveal an inspection window through which the contents of the cartridge 19 may be viewed. The collar 20 also shrouds a needle hub (not shown) when attached to the threaded portion 22 at the front end of the cartridge. [0044] Referring now to FIGS. 4 to 8 , the drive mechanism will now be described in more detail. The dial 16 is fixed to the rear end of a ratchet drive shaft 24 for rotation therewith. At its forward end, the ratchet drive shaft carries a ratchet tooth 26 (see FIGS. 5( a ), ( c ) and 6 ) that cooperates with corresponding inwardly facing latch teeth or recesses 30 on a drive gear 32 (see FIG. 8). A torsion spring 34 is anchored at its rear end to the dial 16 and at its forward end to a fixed support collar 36 which is fixed to the housing of the device. The ratchet drive shaft 24 is free to rotate inside the fixed support collar 36 but is limited to less than one turn of rotation by the interaction of an external rib 37 carried by the ratchet drive shaft 24 and internal ribs 39 carried within the support collar 36. The body 10 has a pair of inwardly directed splines (not shown) that cooperate with corresponding longitudinal grooves 40 formed in the threaded portion 42 of a plunger 44 to hold the plunger against rotation but to allow longitudinal movement thereof. [0045] The drive gear 32 carries at 120\u00b0 intervals around its surface three pairs of teeth 46 for incrementing a dose counter mechanism as to be described below. Forwardly of the teeth 46 , the drive gear has a plurality of latching recesses 48 which cooperate with latching splines 50 on the forward end of the actuator button 18. The actuator button 18 is angularly fixed with respect to the housing and axially movable between a rear position in which the splines 50 engage the latch recesses 48 to prevent rotation of the drive gear to a forward position in which the drive gear is released. [0046] The drive gear carries a threaded bore 52 that is threadedly engaged with the threaded portion 42 of the plunger 44 and so rotation of the drive gear advances the plunger by a preset amount. The threads on the plunger and the bore are multi-start, for example, 4-start threads. [0047] In use, the device is cocked or energised by twisting the dial 16 through a third of a turn to wind up the torsion spring 34 and to rotate the ratchet drive shaft 24 until the ratchet tooth 26 locks in the respective latching recess 30 on the drive gear 32. The drive gear 32 in this position is held against rotation by the splines 50 on the actuator button. In this condition the change in status is registered by the colour change in windows 17 adjacent the dial 16. Pushing the actuator button 18 forwardly releases the drive gear 32 so that it rotates with the ratchet drive shaft 24 under the influence of the torsion spring 34 , advancing the plunger 44. [0048] A counter wheel 54 is mounted concentrically with the drive gear 32 by means of spaced mounting plates 56 which also mount an idler gear 58 which meshes with an inner toothed track 59 on the inside of the counter wheel 54. The plates 56 are angularly fixed with respect to the housing and, as the drive gear 32 rotates, the teeth 46 trip the teeth of the idler cog 58 which in turn rotates the wheel by a uniform increment to register delivery of a dose and to keep a cumulative count. [0049] As in seen in FIG. 7 , the rear end of the plunger is formed with two lugs 60 which, as the plunger reaches its fully extended position engage or move between lugs 62 on the inside of the ratchet drive shaft 24 thereby restricting or preventing further rotation of the ratchet drive shaft relative to the plunger. This not only blocks further forward movement of the plunger, but also prevents the ratchet drive shaft from rotating relative to the housing. This means that the dial 16 is locked against rotational movement, subject to a small amount of backlash. [0050] As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 2 , in order to prepare the device for injection, the forward housing part 12 needs to be slid rearwardly to be snap locked to the rear housing 10. In doing so, this causes the plunger to act on the rear bung (not shown) in the dual chamber cartridge 21 to effect mixing of the medicament. In order to provide a tamper evident feature and also to prevent inadvertent or premature mixing or reconstitution, the device of FIGS. 1 to 8 may be provided with an anti-tamper arrangement. Thus, in FIG. 9 , the injection device is enclosed in plastics or similar removable casing halves 72 , 74 which provide a recess 76 , the opposed edges of which prevent telescopic movement of the forward and rearward housing parts. [0051] In FIG. 10 , a separate plastic component 76 is heat staked around the rear housing part 10 , preventing telescopic movement of the housing parts until removal of the plastic component. [0052] In FIG. 11 , a peelable stick on label 78 is wrapped around the device to prevent the telescopic movement. [0053] In FIG. 12 , a moulded-end tear-off part 80 is integrally moulded with the front housing 12 and designed to be ripped off. The adjoining region between the tear-off part of the front housing may have recesses 82 to prevent sharp edges from being exposed."

  "negative": "The pear variety described as 'Crimson Gold' resulted from an experimental crossing conducted in a similar Oregon orchard. This variety's seedling first bore fruit in the 1999 growing season and revealed exceptional qualities thereafter. It matured in late September. While it demonstrated a moderately upright tree form and produced a large crop of fruit with a bright red hue and sweet taste, the maturity dates for 'Crimson Gold' do not align exactly with 'Lowry Red,' and its fruit size shows more variability across the tree. This variety's asexual reproduction was achieved through grafting onto rootstocks in test orchards. It was observed in the 2006 growing season that 'Crimson Gold' trees, like 'Lowry Red', exhibit average vigor and are regular and productive bearers, with fruit bearing some visual resemblance to the 'Red Bartlett' variety, yet the 'Crimson Gold' has a more ovate fruit shape and less intense red skin color.\n\n",
  "pos": "BACKGROUND OF THE NEW VARIETY The present invention relates to a new, novel and distinct variety of pear tree \u2018Pyrus communis L\u2019 and which has been denominated varietally as \u201c\u2018LOWRY RED\u2019.\u201d The present variety of pear tree resulted from a hybrid cross which was performed by the inventor David B.

The new variety displayed promising characteristics and was then selected for advanced evaluation and reproduction. Asexual reproduction of this new and distinct variety of pear tree was accomplished by grafting the new variety into 10 test trees during February, 2000. These test trees were originally grafted onto unnamed pear seedling rootstock at an orchard near Phoenix, Oreg. The grafted trees produced a few fruit in September, 2002, and subsequently produced normal crop loads in years 2003 and 2004, respectively. Subsequent evaluations of the characteristics of these asexual reproduced trees run true to the original tree. In this regard, all characteristics of the original seedling, and its fruit, were established and transmitted through the succeeding asexual propagations. The \u2018Lowry Red\u2019 is a new and distinct variety of pear tree which produces fruit having a large size and which is highly colored, and which further matures during middle to late September. The fruit produced by this pear tree which is grown near Phoenix, Oreg. has a good flavor, and a high degree of uniformity throughout the tree. In relative comparison to the parents, the fruit of the \u2018Lowry Red\u2019 is mature for harvesting and shipment about one month later than the common commercial \u2018Bartlett\u2019 pear varieties, and its red spots such as \u2018Red Bartlett\u2019 (all unpatented); and about one week earlier than the pear tree variety \u2018Forelle\u2019 (also unpatented) when grown under similar conditions and at the same geographical location. In relative comparison to the \u2018Bartlett\u2019 pear tree, the new variety produces fruit which are equal to or larger than the fruit of the \u2018Bartlett\u2019 pear tree (unpatented) when grown under the ecological conditions prevailing near Phoenix, Oreg. Further, the fruit of the present variety is substantially larger than the fruit produced by the \u2018Forelle\u2019 pear tree. Additionally, the near variety has a red skin color which is more intense than that produced by the \u2018Red Bartlett\u2019 pear tree or the \u2018Forelle\u2019 pear tree. Still further, the present variety produces fruit having a uniform size and shape which is generally considered more uniform than that of either parent.

  "pos": "RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/864,610 filed Jun. 9, 2004, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/928,007 filed Aug. 10, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,813,868, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/224,136, filed Aug. 10, 2000. Each of the above-identified patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention generally relates to the handling of syringes, and is particularly apt for use in automated syringe handling operations, such as syringe filling, labeling and capping operations. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Each year countless syringes are used throughout the world by the healthcare industry for the administration of liquid medications to humans and animals with hypodermic needles or infusion catheters, as well as for delivery of oral and topical medications. Some medications provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers are prepared, stored, and shipped as powders, crystals, or some other solid form due to the lack of stability in solution. These medications are then reconstituted with liquid, such as water or some other suitable liquid solvent. For one or several administrations of a medication, the manual filling of the syringes with reconstituted liquid medication is a small chore. However, larger health care institutions often administer medications in syringes to hundreds of patients per day, thus requiring the rather large chore of filling hundreds of syringes with medications and labeling each filled syringe to show the contents, strength, and fill dates, usually under the direction of a qualified pharmacist. Healthcare providers have found that preparing (e.g. filling and labeling) the quantities of syringes needed has many efficiencies and other advantages when it is done in batches. [0004] In the later regard, batch preparation may be particularly preferred for syringes carrying medications that are not stable in liquid form and are therefore frozen after preparation to maintain acceptable stability. Further, the task of maintaining sterility in the transfer of liquid from containers provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pre-sterilized syringes may be enhanced by batch completion in controlled environments. Also, safety and overall reliability may improve when syringes are prepared in batches by pharmacy personnel or others who are dedicated to and well-trained for the task. [0005] Currently, syringe preparation typically entails a number of separate operations with individual syringe handling. For example, systems used today fill syringes with dispensing pumps that are capable of delivering exact quantities of fluids but that require individual handling of each syringe. Peristaltic pumps that can be accurately calibrated, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,347, are often used. In such arrangements, the syringe caps are packaged so that sterility can be maintained in the capping procedure. The caps are located in trays where each cap is positioned so that the person doing the filling can manually place the tip of the syringe into the cap without touching or holding the cap. Labeling of the syringes has been done using a label dispenser similar to those used for applying pricing labels to grocery or other similar products. [0006] With smaller syringes there are sometimes problems with getting sufficient label information on the syringe without covering over the syringe graduations or blocking the view of the medication. To overcome this, the labels are often applied by hand with the label wrapped around the syringe with most of the label extending from the syringe to form a flag. [0007] Silicone lubricants are used in syringe manufacturing to provide lubrication for lowering the frictional force in movement of the syringe plunger. These silicone lubricants have a characteristic of migrating over all surfaces. Often, this migration causes difficulties in getting pressure sensitive labels to stay in place. This has caused users to use a clear plastic tape to wrap completely around the syringe and the label. [0008] Efforts to automate hospital or clinic-based syringe preparation have been made, but most systems have automated only portions of the process and still require human intervention during critical stages of the process. In one such system, caps are pre-positioned in a cartridge holder. The syringes are also provided in a cartridge where each syringe is oriented. The machine to perform the filling and capping function requires an operator to load the cartridges of caps and syringes. The filling is done with a calibrated peristaltic pump. The machine fills each syringe and places a cap. The labeling is done separately by a labeling machine that is commercially available. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] In view of the foregoing, a broad objective of the present invention is to provide a method, system and apparatus for enhanced syringe handling. A closely related objective is to facilitate automated syringe handling for various operations, such as syringe filling, labeling and capping. [0010] Another objective of the present invention is to provide a syringe handling approach that facilitates the maintenance of sterility. [0011] An additional objective of the present invention is to provide an improved syringe filling and capping approach. [0012] Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved approach for syringe labeling. [0013] In addressing one or more of the above objectives, the present inventors have recognized that significant benefits may be realized by interconnecting multiple syringe bodies to facilitate handling of the same. More particularly, such interconnection allows multiple syringes to be commonly oriented for packaging and/or automated preparation operations. [0014] In one aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided that includes a plurality of syringe bodies, e.g. each comprising a barrel, and a belt fixedly connected to (e.g. adhered to or shrink-wrapped upon) each of the syringe bodies. Each syringe body may further include a plunger at least partially disposed in an open end of the barrel and a removable cap disposed on a dispensing end of the barrel. Of importance, the belt is provided to both interconnect the plurality of syringe bodies and position the same in a predetermined orientation. [0015] In the later regard, and by way of primary example, the dispensing ends of the syringe body barrels may be oriented to extend in a common direction. In addition, the barrels of adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies may be disposed in side-by-side, series relation. Further, the belt may be provided to define a predetermined spacing between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies, such spacing preferably being equidistance throughout a given assembly to accommodate ready positioning in holders adapted for automated operations, as will be further described. [0016] To facilitate handling, production and packaging, the belt may be of a pliable construction. Further, the belt may be advantageously constructed for ready separation in automated labeling operations, as described hereinbelow. In this regard, it is advantageous for the belt to be of a predetermined length between adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies, such predetermined length defining belt segments that are sufficient for the placement of contents information thereupon (e.g. via the application of a label thereto or direct printing thereupon). [0017] Preferably, the belt is interconnected to each of the syringe body barrels. In this regard, the barrels maybe of a common length, wherein the belt is fixedly connected to the barrels along a common portion of the length of each. In addition, the belt may advantageously be of a width that exceeds a majority of a length of each of the barrels. Further, the belt may comprise a first portion that extends between adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies, and a second portion that extends about at least a portion of each of the syringe body barrels. Preferably, the second portion adhesively engages the syringe body barrels and may be substantially transparent to facilitate observation of the volumetric contents within and markings on the syringe barrels. [0018] In one approach, the belt may be defined by opposing layers adjoined in face-to-face relation between adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies and wrapped about opposing sides of the barrels of each of the syringe bodies. At least one of the opposing layers may be substantially transparent to allow for visual determination of volumetric contents and amount. As may be appreciated, a clear pliable plastic material may be utilized for easy and low-cost construction of the belt. [0019] As noted, each syringe body of the inventive apparatus may typically include a plunger and cap. In this regard, the barrel, inserted plunger and applied cap may preferably be assembled under low bioburden environment conditions, such as a class 100,000 or lower clean room. Further, and of importance, the plurality of interconnected syringe bodies should preferably be packaged (e.g. in a shipment container) and thereafter sterilized (e.g. via gamma radiation) to achieve terminal sterilization. [0020] To facilitate the maintenance of a clean internal volume, yet allow for syringe filling, the caps utilized on syringe bodies should preferably engage dispensing ends of the barrels in a mating fashion. By way of primary example, each cap may include an inner member matingly positionable within or about a fluid port of the barrel dispensing end, and an outer member matingly positionable about an outer flange of the barrel dispensing end. [0021] In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for producing an assembly of syringe bodies. The inventive method includes the steps of positioning a plurality of syringe bodies in a predetermined relative orientation, and disposing opposing layers of material about opposing sides of the syringe bodies and in face-to-face relation between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies. As may be appreciated, the inventive method defines an assembly comprising a belt that interconnects and orients a plurality of syringe bodies to facilitate handling as previously described. [0022] In an additional more general aspect of the present invention, an overall method and apparatus for handling a plurality of syringe bodies is provided. Such method comprises the steps of positioning a plurality of syringe bodies in a predetermined orientation, and interconnecting a belt to each of the plurality of syringe bodies in said predetermined orientation. The method may further comprise the step of positioning the plurality of syringe bodies into a plurality of holders for at least one production operation. To facilitate such positioning, the belt may advantageously define a predetermined spacing between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies, wherein the holders are separated by a distance that corresponds with the predetermined spacing between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies. Further, where the belt is constructed of a pliable material, the method may include the step of successively suspending, or hanging, adjacent ones of the syringe bodies so as to position the same for receipt by a holder. [0023] Numerous automated production operations may be facilitated by the disclosed handling method, wherein the holders may be moved along a predetermined path during such operations. Of particular note, one or all of the following production operations may be automated utilizing the invention: filling the plurality of syringe bodies with a predetermined fluid (e.g. reconstituted medication); uncapping and/or recapping the plurality of syringe bodies in conjunction with filling; and labeling the plurality of the syringe bodies to indicate the contents thereof. Each of these production operations will be further described hereinbelow. [0027] In relation to the inventive apparatus for handling a plurality of syringe bodies, it should be appreciated that it is particularly advantageous for the syringe bodies to be interconnected in series by a belt in a predetermined orientation and with a predetermined spacing therebetween. In the latter regard, the inventive apparatus may comprise a plurality of holders for holding the of syringe bodies, such holders being separated by a distance corresponding with the predetermined spacing. [0028] The apparatus may further include a drive for moving the holders along a predetermined path. In this regard, the holders may be oriented so as to locate adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies in substantial parallel relation, wherein the dispensing and opposing ends of the syringe bodies extend outwardly from and in a common orientation relative to the predetermined path. In turn, at least one workstation may be provided having a support member disposed to move towards and away from the dispensing ends of the syringe bodies. By way of primary example, such workstations may be provided for automated filling and/or automated cap removal/replacement, free from manual handling requirements. [0029] Further, one or more workstations may be provided with a support member disposed to move towards and away from an outward facing surface of the belt at locations between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies. Such workstations may provide for automated separation of the belt between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies and/or automated printing of contents information on belt segments located between adjacent ones of the syringe bodies. [0030] In a further aspect of the present invention a method and apparatus is provided for filling syringe bodies. In the inventive method, the filling of each syringe body entails the step of holding the syringe body in at least one holder and the further steps of removing a cap from, filling and replacing the cap back on the syringe body during the holding step. As may be appreciated, completion of the removing, filling and replacing steps while the syringe body is being held by at least one holder yields a significant handling advantage in that manual manipulation of a syringe body may be avoided. [0031] The filling method may further include, for each syringe body, the steps of placing the cap on the dispensing end of the syringe body prior to the holding step, and packaging the syringe body in a container (e.g. for bulk shipment with other syringe bodies) and unpackaging the syringe body from the container after the placing step and prior to the holding step. Such sequencing allows for cap placement and packaging in a production location, followed by shipment to a remote location for unpackaging and completion of the filling method. Further in this regard, the method may include the important step of sterilizing syringe bodies after packaging (e.g. at the production facility prior to shipment). [0032] Additionally, the method may comprise the step of interconnecting a belt to the plurality of syringe bodies in a predetermined orientation. Preferably, such interconnection occurs prior to the packaging and sterilization steps. [0033] In conjunction with the removal and replacement of each of the caps, such steps may include, for each of the syringe bodies, the further steps of retainably engaging the cap in a retainer and moving at least one of the retainer and the holder to affect relative movement between the cap and the dispensing end of the syringe body. Further in this regard, such retainable engagement may be completed by moving the holder for a syringe along a predetermined path so as to insert the cap in the retainer. [0034] In conjunction with noted filling step, the method may further provide for the interconnection of a fluid supply member with a dispensing end of the syringe body and for the flow of fluid into the syringe body through the interconnected fluid supply member. In one embodiment, such steps as well as the cap removal and cap replacement steps, may be completed with the syringe body held at a single location. In such embodiment the retainer, and fluid supply member may be interconnected for tandem forward/rearward and sideways movement. In another embodiment, the cap removal and cap replacement steps may be completed with a syringe body held at a first location, while the filling step may be completed at a second location. Such an approach only requires forward/rearward tandem movement of the retainer and fluid supply member. [0035] Of note, the inventive filling method and apparatus may also provide for sensing of the position of a syringe body plunger during fluid filling. In this regard, optical sensing, pressure sensing or the like may be utilized, wherein a sense signal may be provided that reflects the fluid volume within a syringe as it is filled. In turn, the sense signal may be employed to terminate the flow of fluid at a predetermined amount. In another approach, a predetermined amount of fluid may be drawn into each syringe body via controlled retraction of the associated plunger. [0036] As may be appreciated, the inventive apparatus for filling a plurality of syringe bodies may include at least one, and preferably a plurality of holders for holding a plurality of syringe bodies in a predetermined orientation. Further, the apparatus may include a retainer for retainably engaging the cap of a syringe body, wherein the cap may be selectively removed and replaced by the retainer. Additionally, the apparatus may include a fluid supply member disposed for selective fluid interconnection with a dispensing end of the syringe body. [0037] To facilitate automated operations, the inventive apparatus may further comprise a driven support member for moving the holder(s) along a predetermined path. Additionally, one or more driven support members may be provided for moving the retainer towards/away from the dispensing end(s) of each syringe body and/or for moving the fluid supply member towards and away from the dispensing end(s) of each syringe body. [0038] In yet additional aspect of the present invention, an inventive method and apparatus are provided for labeling a plurality of syringe bodies. The inventive method includes the steps of interconnecting a belt to a plurality of syringe bodies in a predetermined orientation, and placing contents-related information on belt segments interconnected to each of the syringe bodies. The method further includes the step of separating the belt between each of said plurality of syringe bodies to define an interconnected flap (e.g. corresponding with the belt segments) on each of the syringe bodies. [0039] In conjunction with the inventive labeling method, the separating step may provide for severing, or cutting the belt between adjacent ones of the plurality of syringe bodies. Alternatively, the separating step may entail relative displacement of adjacent ones of the syringe bodies so as to achieve separation along perforation lines or the like."

[0002] This innovation pertains to the personal hygiene sector, more precisely to advancements in toothbrush design. [0003] Regular brushing habits are critical for maintaining dental health. There's a recognized need for devices that motivate people, especially younger individuals, to maintain proper oral hygiene. [0006] A previously filed patent illustrates a toothbrush with a light-emitting feature to engage users. However, there's a recognized need for enhancing the user-interactive aspects of toothbrushes to further encourage their use. [0007] Hence, the innovative concept proposed is a toothbrush with a user-friendly interface that includes a plurality of bristles and a unique light system integrated into the handle, capable of guiding users through their brushing routine. [0008] The patent encompasses a toothbrush design that integrates a light for indication purposes, complemented by an energy source and a user-activatable contact mechanism, which upon interaction illuminates the bristles for a predetermined duration. [0009] The invention also presents a method for operating a toothbrush, where the method starts with a user initiating the light feature to guide the brushing process. [0010] Related objects are met by providing a toothbrush possessing a base, body, and head, wherein the body houses an intelligently designed light projection system. [0032] A conventional illuminated toothbrush model includes a structured handle with a built-in light feature aligning with previously established models. [0033] The toothbrush's architecture features segmented components that allow for ease of manufacturing and provide functional aesthetics. [0034] The handle assembly involves common injection molding techniques, producing a toothbrush with distinct brushing and non-brushing sides. [0035] Facilitating the internal electronic structure, the handle possesses a strategically shaped base designed to house the necessary circuitry. [0036] Internal housing guides assist in precise positioning of the light system within the handle's base. [0037] The design makes efficient use of space within the handle to place the light system in an optimal position for functionality while adhering to ergonomic principles. [0038] The orientation of the toothbrush's light system is strategically planned to maximize visibility and user engagement during operation. [0039] To cater to user comfort, the lighting system is set within an ergonomically angled handle, with precise alignment to facilitate light propagation. [0040] An intricate circuitry system is in place to reliably project light through the toothbrush, enhancing the user's experience while brushing. [0041] The circuitry includes various components that work in tandem to achieve a responsive lighting mechanism that serves to indicate the appropriate brushing duration. [0042] A power source situated within the toothbrush's handle works with the circuitry to provide an intermittent light signal as a timing guide during the use. [0043] The head of the toothbrush is designed to optimally channel light provided by the built-in system, enhancing the visibility of the bristles during brushing. [0044] A specialized grip material allows for easy interaction with the toothbrush's lighting system, serving as a practical switch to activate the integrated light. [0045] The grip is engineered to work seamlessly with the light circuit, enabling simple operation of the lighting feature to signal brushing time. [0046] In use, the technologically advanced toothbrush indicates the duration of brushing required, helping users adhere to proper brushing time with an interactive light system. [0047] A light beam is projected within the toothbrush's handle and is designed to inform the user visually throughout the brushing routine, with adjustments available to suit various notification preferences.\n\n",

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0032] FIG. 1 illustrates a prior art illuminated toothbrush 10 , which comprises a handle 12 , an illumination circuit 14 , a brush 16 , and a grip 18. [0033] As shown in FIG. 1 , the handle 12 comprises a base 20 , a body 21 , and a head 26. The body 21 has a first section 22 and a second section 24. The handle 12 can be formed of hard, clear plastic. In one arrangement, the handle 12 can be a colored plastic. In another arrangement, the handle 12 can be a translucent plastic. In yet another embodiment, the handle 12 may be fashioned out of a plastic incorporating metallic flake 55. [0034] The toothbrush handle 12 can be formed through an injection molding process. In such an embodiment, plastic in a liquid form can be injected into a mold having two sections. Liquid plastic can be injected into the mold where it is then allowed to solidify. When the mold is opened it creates a handle having a brush side 28 and a non-brush side 30. At the intersection of these two sides 28 , 30 can be a ridge 32. The ridge 32 can be a surface characteristic resulting from the injection molding process. In the illustrated arrangement, the ridge 32 does not extend inside the handle 12 but exists on the surface. The injection molding process in constructing of the toothbrush handle 12 is conventional and does not form a part of the present invention. [0035] As seen in FIGS. 5 , 6 , and 8 , the handle 12 can include a handle base 20. The base 20 can be generally cylindrical in shape and can have a circumferential groove or cavity 44 therein. The circumferential groove 44 can have a centerline. The base 20 has an outside surface 34 , an inside surface 36 , a first end 38 , and a second end 40. In the illustrated arrangement, on the outside surface 34 of the base 20 are three annular rings 42. The annular rings 42 can provide a ledge upon which the grip 18 holds. [0036] The inside surface 36 defines the cavity 44. The inside surface 36 can have a first indentation 46 and a second indentation 48. The cavity 44 can serve as a housing for the illumination circuit 14. The first and second indentation 46 , 48 can serve as a guide for positioning the illumination circuit 14 within the base 20. [0037] A chamber 50 can extend within the section 22. The chamber 50 has a first end 52 and a second end 54. The chamber 50 can be generally cylindrical in shape. The first end 52 can be rounded and can provide a transition between the chamber 50 filled full of air and the first section 22 which is of plastic. The air is inherently present as a result of assembly at a time after the handle was formed. Alternatively, the chamber may be filled full of a material in a process separate from the forming of the handle. [0038] The second end 54 of the chamber 50 can be open to the first end 38 of the base 20. The first section chamber 50 can be in off-center alignment with the base 20. As seen in FIG. 8 , the first section chamber 50 is in off-center alignment with the base 20 to allow the projector of a light beam or illuminating member 60 to emit a light beam 56 that travels through the first section 22 and to strike the interface 65 between the second section 24 and atmosphere. At this interface, a light beam 57 can be reflected towards the handle head 26 and a light beam 58 can be refracted towards the atmosphere. [0039] The first section chamber 50 can be also positioned in off-center alignment with the base 20 because in the first section 22 is ergometrically designed to accommodate a user&#39;s grip. In the ergometric design, the brush side 28 of the first section 22 is contoured and the non brush side 30 of the first section 22 is flat. In addition, the brush side 28 of the first section 22 arrives at a point of the second section 24 at a greater angle than the non brush side 30. In other words, the illumination circuit 14 extends within the first section 22 substantially parallel to the center line of the base member 20 but the first section 22 brush side 28 angles toward the inner point where the first section 22 meets the second section 24 and the non brush side 30 portion of the first section 22 also angles toward the point where the first section 22 meets the second section 24. Thus, for the first section chamber 50 to extend the furthest into the first section 22 of the handle 12 , the first section chamber 50 is preferably positioned closer to the non-brush side 30 of the first section 22. [0040] The illumination circuit 14 can have an illuminating member or projector of a light beam 60 , a resistor 62 , a timing circuit 64 , and a power source 66. These parts can be joined by the conductor 68 , which provides a support structure extending the illuminating member 60 a distance away from the timing circuit 64. The negative terminal conductor 70 can be a spring which presses against the power source 66 , which in the illustrated arrangement comprises a series of batteries. The positive terminal conductor 72 can comprise a pair of prongs that extends away from the timing circuit 64 to embrace the power source 66. The positive terminal conductor 72 can also be sized to stabilize the illumination circuit 14 within the base 20 as the positive terminal conductor 72 is sized to fit within the first indentation 46 and the second indentation 48 of the base 20. [0041] The illumination member 60 in this embodiment is a light emitting diode (LED). In other embodiments, the illumination member 60 could be an incandescent light bulb. In still other embodiments, the illumination member 60 may be any other device known in the art that may provide illumination. [0042] The power source 66 in one arrangement can be micro-cell battery model number G3-ACNB. In the illustrated arrangement, three batteries are placed in series within the base 20. The timing circuit 64 preferably can function to illuminate the illumination member 60 for approximately 60 seconds. The timing circuit 64 also preferably can serve to control the illumination member 60 to blink intermittently for the time period in which it is engaged. In some embodiments, the illumination member 60 may stay on continuously and/or illuminate for a longer or shorter period of time. In the illustrated embodiment, the circuit is activated by closing an electrical switch 74 to complete a circuit. [0043] The brush 16 can have a bristle 80. The bristle 80 can have a first end 82 and a second end 84. The bristle second end 84 can be embedded in the head 26 of the handle 12. In one arrangement, the bristle 80 can be made of clear plastic material. Moreover, in such an arrangement, the brush 10 can be configured such that, when the bristle 80 is struck by light traveling from the illumination member 60 through the first section 22 and the second section 24 , a portion of the light striking the bristle 80 may reflect through the bristle 80 and extend out of the bristle 80. [0044] The grip 18 can be made of a flexible material. In the illustrated arrangement, the grip 18 can also serve as a switch. For example, the grip 18 can have an extending piece or switch 74 of flexible material as seen in FIG. 7. When the grip is pushed in the direction of arrow A in FIG. 4 , the piece 74 moves the positive terminal metal conductor 72 to contact the power source 66. Alternatively, the piece 74 moves the power source 66 to contact the positive terminal metal conductor 72. In doing so, the piece 74 moves illumination circuit 14 from an un-illuminated position to a illuminated position. The grip 18 can remain in place on the base 20 by engaging the annular rings 42 on the outside surface 34 of the base 20. An adhesive 88 can be positioned between the first section 22 and the grip 18 to hold the grip 18 in close connection with the first section 22. [0045] The grip 18 can be made of a flexible material. Alternatively, the grip 18 may be of a hard material but have a flexible portion that may be used to engage the positive terminal conductor 72 and press against the power source 66. [0046] In operation, the illuminated toothbrush 10 is used by a user to indicate the duration of an amount of time. The user grips the toothbrush handle 12 in their hand with the bristle 80 surface with the bristle 80 against their teeth and engages the illumination circuit switch 74. The illumination member 60 begins to blink intermittently in an on/off fashion. The illumination member 60 continues to blink for a period of approximately 60 seconds. The handle is designed to direct light to the user in multiple ways so that the user may be accurately apprised of brushing time. The frequency of blinking can remain constant, or vary in frequency. In some embodiments, the frequency can increase as the time approaches 60 seconds. In some embodiments, the frequency can remain constant through a first period of time, and increase in frequency in a second period of time. In one example, the frequency can remain constant for approximately 45 seconds; then increase for the remaining 15 seconds. In other embodiments, different time intervals can be used, such as, for example, two even periods of thirty seconds each. [0047] A light beam 59 travels from the illuminating device 14 through a first section chamber 50. The light beam 59 strikes an interface 63 between the first section chamber and the first section and a light beam 61 is partially reflected off of the interface and a light beam 56 is refracted enters the first chamber."
